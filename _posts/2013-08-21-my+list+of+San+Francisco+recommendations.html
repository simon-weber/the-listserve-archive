<p>Hey y&#8217;all,</p>
<p>For those of you that haven&#8217;t been to San Francisco, here is a list of my favorite things to do in the area:</p>
<p>1. Eat Bi-Rite ice cream in Dolores Park<br />2. Tan yourself with other hip San Francisco residents at Dolores Park<br />3. Visit Bi-Rite grocery store in the Mission<br />4. Visit Golden Gate park and climb to the top of the DeYoung Museum<br />5. Stare at beautiful art at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (&#8220;SFMoMA&#8221;)<br />6. Window shop on Valencia St in The Mission - start at 16th and Valencia and walk to 25th and Valencia<br />7. Visit the Ferry Building Farmers Market (on Saturdays) under the Bay Bridge<br />8. Take a cable car on the California Line to Pac Heights and meander back down Fillmore St<br />9.

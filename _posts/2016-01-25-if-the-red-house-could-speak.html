    body: "If the Red House could speak, it would say, \u201CI\u2019m afraid, don\u2019\
      t leave me. I\u2019m scared, scared from fading away and becoming a mere memory.\u201D\
      \ The Red House is in danger of being demolished, to be replaced by yet another\
      \ grey high-rise. Its residents have been ordered to evacuate, and pack centuries\
      \ of memories in five days.\r\n\r\nIf the Red House could speak, it would tell\
      \ us, \u201CI\u2019m a gem, special and rare, still standing in Ras Beirut,\
      \ at the heart of the capital of Lebanon.\u201D The Red House is a landmark\
      \ of the area, being one of the last surviving historic houses of Ras Beirut.\
      \ It stands vibrant with its famous red door, red windows, and green trees.\
      \ It\u2019s an oasis in a city that is losing its color to urbanization and\
      \ concrete. Its Red Windows would count how they witnessed the changes in the\
      \ city over the years.\r\n\r\nIf the Red House could speak, it would tell us\
      \ how it feels treated like a Queen by its current resident and all the family,\
      \ friends and even strangers that visit it. Samir, an architect and conservationist\
      \ who was born and raised in the Red House, took very good care of it, keeping\
      \ it well-maintained and preserving its architectural historical features. Samir,\
      \ also a gastronome who cooks passionately always welcomes visitors to lunch\
      \ or dinner with a delicious home cooked meal.\r\n\r\nIf the Red House could\
      \ speak, it would tell us how it reigned like a Kind during the many wars the\
      \ city witnessed. It protected many from the surrounding bomb shelling. Countless\
      \ family and friends took refuge inside its strong and warm walls.\r\n\r\nIf\
      \ the Red House could speak, it probably would still hold some secrets, but\
      \ couldn\u2019t help but brag about the role it played in the independence of\
      \ Lebanon. Many meetings were held in its central hall by prominent political\
      \ figures, discussing Lebanon and plotting its independence in the early 1940s.\r\
      \n\r\nIf the Red House could speak, it would take a deep breath, close its eyes,\
      \ and wonder how long it would still stand its ground. It\u2019s difficult to\
      \ remember how Ras Beirut was back in the 18th century, when the first part\
      \ of the Red House was built, in the middle of fields of orange trees. The lady\
      \ of the house at that time planted more trees in its courtyard. Now, the trees\
      \ outlast the surrounding concrete jungle.\r\n\r\nIf the Red House could speak,\
      \ it would recount endless stories of all the people who cherished it, lived\
      \ in it, and passed by. If its Red Door could smile, it would smile back at\
      \ all the curious strangers, peeking through it, trying to get a glimpse of\
      \ the hidden garden and courtyard behind.\r\n\r\nIf the Red House could speak,\
      \ it would scream, \u201CI want to stay alive!\u201D\r\n\r\nIf the Red House\
      \ could speak, it would reply, \u201CI hear you, thank you!\u201D to all the\
      \ people that are offering their support in our current efforts to safeguard\
      \ an icon of Lebanese traditional houses, and to keep our values and heritage\
      \ alive.\r\n\r\nIf the Red House could speak, it would tell us, \u201CI love\
      \ you back!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Red House would love your support as well. It is\

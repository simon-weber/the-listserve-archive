    body: "When I got it for my birthday I was told it was a doll for boys. For me\
      \ it didn\u2019t matter if dolls were for boys or girls. I just knew I liked\
      \ mine. It was special to me. It had a small red nose, freckles, a soft cotton\
      \ body and a plastic head with a beautiful smile. The kind of smile that is\
      \ not too obvious, but modest and reassuring. My grandmother used to make clothes\
      \ for it. Pretty woolen clothes that made me think of the warm clothes she made\
      \ for me. It was the first thing that I ever named and took care of. Every evening\
      \ it sat in my room and watched over me while I went to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
      \n\r\nAs I grew older I started to notice that the combination of having a doll\
      \ and being a boy was looked upon as strange. Something I obviously didn\u2019\
      t want to be. I still liked my doll but I was really scared about what my friends\
      \ and other people would say if they would find out. He was my first real secret.\
      \ As friends stayed over I would hide him in the closet. After they left I took\
      \ him out again and tell him I was very sorry. This worked out pretty well for\
      \ my doll and me until one day I forgot to put him in the closet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\
      \r\nThe boy that came over for our play date was very loud scared me a bit.\
      \ He always wanted to play war or throw stuff. I did not really like him, but\
      \ he asked my mom and me to come over so many times, I finally said yes. The\
      \ day he came to my house he was even more hyperactive than usual. He was throwing\
      \ toys around and I just wanted him to leave. When my mother got enough of the\
      \ yelling, running and throwing she said we should go upstairs and play in my\
      \ room. As he went up the stairs towards my bedroom I just hoped his father\
      \ would come to pick him up quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI followed him into my room\
      \ and before I knew it he was holding my doll. He held him upside-down and said\
      \ it was the stupidest doll he had ever seen. I was so ashamed for the fact\
      \ that he saw that I had a doll, that I told him it was my sisters. To make\
      \ sure he would believe me I said I didn\u2019t like it and thought dolls were\
      \ stupid. After that remark he started to throw him around.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
      I could hear the sound his head made when it hit my bed, my desk and finally\
      \ the stairs. All the way down. I watched and tried to fake a smile. \u201C\
      This doll is so stupid, look at its silly red nose, and look at its stupid clothes\u201D\
      . I nodded. I felt like the weakest person in the world. After a while he got\
      \ bored of throwing it around. I hoped he would quit, but he didn\u2019t. Instead\
      \ he got a green marker and started to draw a moustache on his face, I just\
      \ watched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHis father finally came to pick him up. They left\
      \ and I just felt incredibly sorry. I immediately tried to wash of the moustache\
      \ using a big white towel. The towel was getting greener every time I wiped\
      \ his face, but one green stripe just didn\u2019t come off. No matter how hard\
      \ I would rub the towel against the shiny plastic. I promised myself I would\
      \ never be this weak again. It was his first scar. He still smiled.\r\n\r\n\r\

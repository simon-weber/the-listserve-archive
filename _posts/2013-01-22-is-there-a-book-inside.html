      \ limited here so rather than go into great detail, I thought I would list a\
      \ partial cast of characters...and characters they were. These are just fine\
      \ folks from the convenience store. Let's just say the people of wal mart site\
      \ is pretty accurate. I'd need way more than 600 words just to get started on\
      \ that job.\r\n \r\nRon.Mid 30's. Addicted to paint and glue. Face and shoes\
      \ constantly dotted with evidence to back that up. Would do anything for a pack\
      \ of smokes. Climb the telephone pole in only his underwear? Yes. Sell all his\
      \ hair? Yes. Eat bugs? Sure.\r\n \r\nWinston. Older gentleman. Always quiet\
      \ and polite. Smoked menthol cigarettes that he preferred to shop for in the\
      \ middle of the night. That way, he stood a much smaller chance of being noticed\
      \ by the police while he walked the neighborhood stark naked. After being told\
      \ by me that he had to wear at least underpants the next time he came in he\
      \ showed up with a pair...on his head.\r\n \r\nThe man who tried to rob us while\
      \ masturbating into our magazine rack. The 911 operator had the nerve to ask\
      \ us if he had a deadly weapon.\r\n \r\nThe little girl who carried her change\
      \ in her mouth and spit it onto the counter. That action very nearly resulted\
      \ in an old fashioned butt whippin'.\r\n \r\nThe guy with Tom Cruise good looks\
      \ who drove a flashy sports car with the plates that said \"I'm Ugly\" so people\
      \ would tell him how wrong they were.\r\n \r\nThe employee who rang up scratch\
      \ off tickets, for himself, instead of cigarettes every time he sold a pack.\
      \ (Cigs were $2.00 then) He didn't know WHY this was stealing. He also held\
      \ his head sideways. All the time.\r\n \r\nThe night clerk who had sex with\
      \ the UPS guy in my office.\r\n \r\nThe milk delivery guy who met women on my\
      \ parking lot and took them to his truck for quickies.\r\n \r\nThe woman in\
      \ the Jaguar who would sit on the lot and honk-thinking we were full service.\
      \ We weren't. She tried at least twice a week though.\r\n \r\nThe woman who\
      \ pissed off the clerk on duty. He, in turn, shut down the air pump at the precise\
      \ moment she would touch it to her tire. She would then walk back the the machine,\
      \ restart it and head back to her tire. This happened about 20 times before\
      \ she threw the hose to the ground and came back in the store to piss him off\
      \ a little more. It was about 110 degrees out while this was happening. Don't\
      \ piss off the clerk.\r\n \r\nThe employee who would randomly scream \"Fuck\
      \ You\" at anyone who happened to be standing there. Customers, me, the district\
      \ manager. At least he didn't steal scratch off's...\r\n \r\nThis is just a\
      \ small sampling of the characters. I could go on and on but am running out\

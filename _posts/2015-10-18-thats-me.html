      \ the pan from the heat. Add a splash of the cooking water and toss well, season\
      \ with pepper, then pour in the egg mixture \u2013 the pan will help to cook\
      \ the egg gently, rather than scrambling it. Toss well, adding more cooking\
      \ water until it\u2019s lovely and glossy. Serve with a grating of Parmesan\
      \ and an extra twist of pepper.\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrea\r\nandreaci_@outlook.com\r\

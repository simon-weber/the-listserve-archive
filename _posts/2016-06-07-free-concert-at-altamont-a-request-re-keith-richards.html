    body: "Some say history is written by the victors, but I'm not so sure about that.\
      \  Most of the time it's pretty fuzzy who the victors are...\r\n\r\nThis I know:\
      \  history is often written --sometimes gouged in stone-- by those seeking to\
      \ keep the status quo intact.\r\n\r\nHave you heard about the Free Concert at\
      \ Altamont?\r\n\r\nI'll tell you, since I'm producing 2 documentaries on Altamont.\r\
      \n\r\nBut first I'll ask---knowing it's a long shot----do you know Keith Richards,\
      \ guitarist of the Rolling Stones?  if so, could you possibly connect us up?\r\
      \n\r\nEven 5- to 10-minute interview will work!  It's for those Altamont documentaries\
      \ I started telling you about...\r\n\r\nQ: What's Altamont?\r\nA: There's the\
      \ conventional narrative, vs. the more interesting narrative.\r\n\r\nConventional:\r\
      \n\r\n\"Four months after the peaceful Woodstock Festival, San Francisco psychedelic\
      \ bands and the Rolling Stones gather--a carelessly planned event at a decrepit\
      \ demolition derby racetrack, godforsaken part of California, bitter cold winter,\
      \ Hells Angels 'Security' stab a black teenager to death, while the Rolling\
      \ Stones play.\"\r\n\r\nThe more interesting history is a mosaic of stories--creating\
      \ a far more complex, far different picture of Altamont.\r\n\r\nMainstream narratives\
      \ assert that violence at Altamont marked the death of idealism--the end of\
      \ countercultures.  An oft-repeated tale of comeuppance--to those daring to\
      \ believe in or live by rules of love, human connectedness, spontaneity, expressiveness,\
      \ caring for each other, goodness, openness, compassion, personal freedom.\r\
      \n\r\nThing is: these ideals didn't come to the fore exclusively during the\
      \ 1960s.  They always come to the fore, over time immemorial--and they're always\
      \ a direct challenge to hierarchical, materialistic, individual-as-king, linear\
      \ dictums of \"reality\u201D that line up as soldiers buttressing the status\
      \ quo.\r\n\r\nThese ideals didn't die at Altamont....and were vibrantly alive\
      \ the night before.\r\n\r\nDocumentaries:\r\n\r\n        (1) \"The Night Before\
      \ Altamont\" (radio)\r\n\r\n        (2) Altamont 360\xB0 (film + interactive\
      \ transmedia components)\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\n\r\n(1)  Conventional narratives about\
      \ Altamont suck. Aside from Gimme Shelter (1969 film--see it!), they're marked\
      \ by blame, shame, cynicism, ideological hatred, recrimination, and sensationalism.\r\
      \n\r\nIn other words, history by self-proclaimed \"victors\" seeking to ridicule\
      \ and squash humanistic ideals as silly and \"congenitally naive.\"\r\n\r\n\
      My documentaries--inspired by Kurosawa's Rashomon---radically reframe Altamont\
      \ by presenting multiple simultaneous perspectives, underscoring that \"alternative\"\
      \ narratives are as real and true--if not more so--than those making it \"through\"\
      \ to claim One Real Truth.\r\n\r\n(2) When people die, their stories die too--unless\
      \ collected.\r\n\r\nI've interviewed 2 dozen and met dozens more Altamont denizens----Director\
      \ Albert Maysles, free-spirits who hitchhiked as teenagers to Altamont, current\
      \ and former Hells Angels (both men of integrity, very kind to me), Grateful\
      \ Dead and Rolling Stones management, Black Panthers, many more.\r\n\r\n- Some\
      \ died---never to see the finished product (heartbreaking)\r\n- Those alive\
      \ must be interviewed to tell their truths!\r\n\r\nKeith Richards?\r\n\r\nJust\
      \ 12 hours before the concert, Altamont radiated positive cooperative energy--hundreds\
      \ of Bay Area volunteers creating concert infrastructure, thousands of kids\
      \ camping\u200B, \u200Bjoyfully anticipating the next day's events.\r\n\r\n\
      Atmosphere so cool Keith Richards spent the night there, alone!\r\n\r\n\"I went\
      \ the night before, and I stayed. It was really beautiful...everywhere I went\
      \ was a gas. People were sitting around campfires...getting high...it was really\
      \ cool...\" (Rolling Stone magazine, 1971)\r\n\r\nThis story has not been adequately\
      \ told---and new mythos emerge claiming the night before was also dark and violent.\r\
      \n\r\nI need Keith's voice to round out the radio documentary.\r\n\r\nJust a\
      \ few words from Keith will incentivize public radio to air \"The Night Before\
      \ Altamont.\"\r\n\r\nOnce aired, \"The Night Before Altamont\" will stand alone--plus\
      \ serve as \"demo reel\" for film, Altamont 360\xB0\r\n\r\nHelp me get even\

      <p>This I know:  history is often written --sometimes gouged in stone-- by those
      seeking to keep the status quo intact.</p>

      <p>Have you heard about the Free Concert at Altamont?</p>

      <p>I''ll tell you, since I''m producing 2 documentaries on Altamont.</p>

      <p>But first I''ll ask---knowing it''s a long shot----do you know Keith Richards,

      <p>Even 5- to 10-minute interview will work!  It''s for those Altamont documentaries
      I started telling you about...</p>

      <p>Q: What''s Altamont?<br />A: There''s the conventional narrative, vs. the
      more interesting narrative.</p>

      <p>Conventional:</p>

      <p>"Four months after the peaceful Woodstock Festival, San Francisco psychedelic
      bands and the Rolling Stones gather--a carelessly planned event at a decrepit
      demolition derby racetrack, godforsaken part of California, bitter cold winter,
      Hells Angels ''Security'' stab a black teenager to death, while the Rolling
      Stones play."</p>

      <p>The more interesting history is a mosaic of stories--creating a far more
      complex, far different picture of Altamont.</p>

      <p>Mainstream narratives assert that violence at Altamont marked the death of
      idealism--the end of countercultures.  An oft-repeated tale of comeuppance--to
      those daring to believe in or live by rules of love, human connectedness, spontaneity,
      expressiveness, caring for each other, goodness, openness, compassion, personal
      freedom.</p>

      <p>Thing is: these ideals didn''t come to the fore exclusively during the 1960s.  They
      always come to the fore, over time immemorial--and they''re always a direct
      challenge to hierarchical, materialistic, individual-as-king, linear dictums
      of "reality&#8221; that line up as soldiers buttressing the status quo.</p>

      <p>These ideals didn''t die at Altamont....and were vibrantly alive the night
      before.</p>

      <p>Documentaries:</p>

      <p>        (1) "The Night Before Altamont" (radio)</p>

      <p>        (2) Altamont 360&#176; (film + interactive transmedia components)</p>

      <p>Why?</p>

      <p>(1)  Conventional narratives about Altamont suck. Aside from Gimme Shelter
      (1969 film--see it!), they''re marked by blame, shame, cynicism, ideological
      hatred, recrimination, and sensationalism.</p>

      <p>In other words, history by self-proclaimed "victors" seeking to ridicule
      and squash humanistic ideals as silly and "congenitally naive."</p>

      by presenting multiple simultaneous perspectives, underscoring that "alternative"
      narratives are as real and true--if not more so--than those making it "through"

      <p>- Some died---never to see the finished product (heartbreaking)<br />- Those
      alive must be interviewed to tell their truths!</p>

      <p>Keith Richards?</p>

      <p>Just 12 hours before the concert, Altamont radiated positive cooperative
      energy--hundreds of Bay Area volunteers creating concert infrastructure, thousands
      of kids camping&#8203;, &#8203;joyfully anticipating the next day''s events.</p>

      which victors "&#8203;write" &#8203;history&#8203; &#8203;&#8203;and &#8203;tell

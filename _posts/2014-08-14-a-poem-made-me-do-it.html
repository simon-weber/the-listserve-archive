      \r\nHere's the poem ...\r\n\r\nClancy Of The Overflow\r\n\r\nI had written him\
      \ a letter which I had, for want of better\r\nKnowledge, sent to where I met\
      \ him down the Lachlan, years ago,\r\nHe was shearing when I knew him, so I\
      \ sent the letter to him,\r\nJust `on spec', addressed as follows, `Clancy,\
      \ of The Overflow'.\r\n\r\nAnd an answer came directed in a writing unexpected,\r\
      \n(And I think the same was written with a thumb-nail dipped in tar)\r\n'Twas\
      \ his shearing mate who wrote it, and verbatim I will quote it:\r\n`Clancy's\
      \ gone to Queensland droving, and we don't know where he are.'\r\n\r\nIn my\
      \ wild erratic fancy visions come to me of Clancy\r\nGone a-droving `down the\
      \ Cooper' where the Western drovers go;\r\nAs the stock are slowly stringing,\
      \ Clancy rides behind them singing,\r\nFor the drover's life has pleasures that\
      \ the townsfolk never know.\r\n\r\nAnd the bush hath friends to meet him, and\
      \ their kindly voices greet him\r\nIn the murmur of the breezes and the river\
      \ on its bars,\r\nAnd he sees the vision splendid of the sunlit plains extended,\r\
      \nAnd at night the wond'rous glory of the everlasting stars.\r\n\r\nI am sitting\
      \ in my dingy little office, where a stingy\r\nRay of sunlight struggles feebly\
      \ down between the houses tall,\r\nAnd the foetid air and gritty of the dusty,\
      \ dirty city\r\nThrough the open window floating, spreads its foulness over\
      \ all\r\n\r\nAnd in place of lowing cattle, I can hear the fiendish rattle\r\
      \nOf the tramways and the 'buses making hurry down the street,\r\nAnd the language\
      \ uninviting of the gutter children fighting,\r\nComes fitfully and faintly\
      \ through the ceaseless tramp of feet.\r\n\r\nAnd the hurrying people daunt\
      \ me, and their pallid faces haunt me\r\nAs they shoulder one another in their\
      \ rush and nervous haste,\r\nWith their eager eyes and greedy, and their stunted\

      accustomed. Five years later. I wouldn''t change a thing. I see the stars at

      <p>Here''s the poem ...</p>

      <p>Clancy Of The Overflow</p>

      <p>I had written him a letter which I had, for want of better<br />Knowledge,
      sent to where I met him down the Lachlan, years ago,<br />He was shearing when
      I knew him, so I sent the letter to him,<br />Just `on spec'', addressed as
      follows, `Clancy, of The Overflow''.</p>

      <p>And an answer came directed in a writing unexpected,<br />(And I think the
      same was written with a thumb-nail dipped in tar)<br />''Twas his shearing mate
      who wrote it, and verbatim I will quote it:<br />`Clancy''s gone to Queensland
      droving, and we don''t know where he are.''</p>

      <p>In my wild erratic fancy visions come to me of Clancy<br />Gone a-droving
      `down the Cooper'' where the Western drovers go;<br />As the stock are slowly
      stringing, Clancy rides behind them singing,<br />For the drover''s life has
      pleasures that the townsfolk never know.</p>

      <p>And the bush hath friends to meet him, and their kindly voices greet him<br
      />In the murmur of the breezes and the river on its bars,<br />And he sees the
      vision splendid of the sunlit plains extended,<br />And at night the wond''rous
      glory of the everlasting stars.</p>

      <p>I am sitting in my dingy little office, where a stingy<br />Ray of sunlight
      struggles feebly down between the houses tall,<br />And the foetid air and gritty
      of the dusty, dirty city<br />Through the open window floating, spreads its
      foulness over all</p>

      <p>And in place of lowing cattle, I can hear the fiendish rattle<br />Of the

      uninviting of the gutter children fighting,<br />Comes fitfully and faintly

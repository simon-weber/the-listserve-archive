      \ board on the ground greater revealed the contents of his basket. A length\
      \ of rope was tied in a circle and on it watches were kept; all showing different\
      \ times, many scratched to shit and looking altogether pretty second-hand. \"\

      \ \"OK OK!\" Delicately, he put the watches atop the sunglasses on the ground,\
      \ getting to a collection of small cardboard boxes in his basket. Opening one,\
      \ he pulled out a bottle of fragrance, half full. \"Want perfumes?\"\r\n\r\n\
      Now, it'd be a cold day in hell that I'd catch myself carrying perfume but I\
      \ got away with, \"no, no woman, no girlfriend, no wife\".\r\n\r\nThe toothy\
      \ grin persisted, accompanied with the now customary \"OK OK!\" and he began\
      \ placing those items on the ground beside the rest of his booty. By now, his\
      \ basket was mostly empty. He pulled out its last item which was obscured by\

      \ half a step back. It was broad daylight and totally in public. There were\

    body: "Hello! It's nice to meet you. \r\n\r\nI have thought often about what I\
      \ might write to you.  I was so terribly excited to finally have the opportunity\
      \ to say something to you. You know? To really make a difference.  To impart\
      \ upon you some great piece of wisdom.  To share some new information with you.\
      \  \r\n\r\nYou have already shared so much with me, and I know that I will be\
      \ learning so much more from you. So what can I do for you? I believe in treating\
      \ others how you want to be treated.\r\nSo, maybe I can make you laugh?\r\n\r\
      \nHere is my favorite joke: \r\nGeorge: Have you heard the one about the snake\
      \ in the golf hole? \r\nLisa: No, I haven't. \r\nGeorge: Neither have I.\r\n\
      \r\nAs you can see, joke telling is not my forte. The faces that I make to go\
      \ along with the jokes is where my comedy lies ( I apologize if I did not use\
      \ the correct form of that word...it's confusing).\r\n\r\nWhat else can I share\
      \ with you? I love to bake. I often substitute coconut oil (cold pressed organic\
      \ virgin) for half or all of the butter to change the flavor profile and perhaps\
      \ make baked treats a little healthier. I also add a tablespoon of high quality\
      \ baking powder to any recipe calling for chocolate.  This always adds a lot\
      \ to the chocolate flavor!\r\n\r\nI think what I want to share the most with\
      \ you is my passion. Truly and deeply, I am an artist and want nothing more\
      \ than to share art with you.  Specifically, I would love to sing you a song\
      \ I've written.  Since I can't sing to you, I  thought I could write down the\
      \ lyrics to a song I recently wrote. You can imagine a melody, write another\
      \ verse, paint a picture, make a sculpture, or ignore it. Whatever suits your\
      \ fancy.\r\n\r\n\"Hey Moon\" \r\n\r\nHey, Moon! How's it going? Are you waxing?\
      \ Are you waning? Have you seen the sun recently?\r\nHey, Moon! How's it going?\
      \ Are you full? Are you new? Are you pulling the tide to and fro?\r\nThe stars\
      \ are shining bright. I can hardly see their light beyond your beauty. My beautiful\
      \ Moon.\r\nHey, Moon! How's it going? Hanging high in the sky, you hold the\
      \ secrets to the night.\r\nHey, Moon! How ya doin'? Haven't seen you in some\
      \ time. I 've been workin' all day long, sleepin' away the night.\r\nThe stars\
      \ are shining bright. I can hardly see their light beyond your beauty, my beautiful\
      \ Moon. \r\nHey, Moon! How ya doin'? Haven't seen you in some time. How I miss\
      \ you. I want to kiss you, instead I see you in the sky.\r\nMy beautiful Moon.\r\

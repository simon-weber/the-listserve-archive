      <p>-I was last weekend to a wonderful wedding. It was of course the celebration
      of love. But a nice tribute to friendship too. Friendship as an opportunity
      to build a second family with the chance of the meetings. Just take your phone/your
      pen/your oven and send a text/a letter/a brownie to an old friend you didn&#8217;t

      <p>-If you want to make the revolution (in science/politics or whatsoever stuff),
      drop me an email, we need to talk!</p>

      <p>-The most powerful sentence I&#8217;ve heard these years: &#8220;Happiness
      is a state of mind&#8221;. It seems very simple, but I think it&#8217;s a part
      of the answer. When I am deeply sad, I tell myself that &#8220;my machine to
      see things in a positive way&#8221; is broken.</p>

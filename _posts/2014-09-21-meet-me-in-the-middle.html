      \ Like the elderly man who wore a grey suit and matched it with an olive green\
      \ checkered scarf to go with his grey-green-striped hat, who commanded everyone\u2019\
      s attention as he drawled in his thick, deep voice the beauties of the Rembrandt\
      \ painting he held in his hands. A black* man. He said he was an artist and\
      \ I was certain he was a nutter, despite his handsome attire. \u2019You know\
      \ what this is? This is a Rembrandt painting, and it\u2019s going on my wall.\
      \ Ooooh yeah, it\u2019s going right there on my wall\u2019. At that moment,\

      \ She thought that was weird. She had her eyes closed the whole time she was\

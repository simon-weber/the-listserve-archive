    body: "Nudity is beautity, I am a nudist and it isn't a sex thing. Growing up\
      \ with an abusive father and a dying mother my refuge was being naked in my\
      \ bedroom. I could hide there, be naked and no one bothered me. I never knew\
      \ there was a term for enjoying being naked. In 2006 an ad for Naked Bowling\
      \ appeared in my email box in response to an ad I had responded a few years\
      \ prior. I was nervous, but still went, in my neon purple wig. It was a Halloween,\
      \ naked costume bowling. Naked bowling is to this day my favorite event. Being\
      \ naked in a group, everyone is equal. Doctors, lawyers, fast food workers and\
      \ the unemployed. There is a lot more honest conversation and most importantly\
      \ eye contact and personal connections. Respect is the key. Nudists are the\
      \ most respectful group.\r\n\r\nFast forward 9 years, 100+ events (bowling,\
      \ tea tasting, dinners, potlucks, discussion groups, camping, casino night plus\
      \ more) and I have served for the last 3 years as Secretary/Treasurer for Chicago's\
      \ longest running group Chicago Area Naturist Sons. 25 years and no signs of\
      \ ending. The group had rough patches, but people who cared stepped up, took\
      \ over and made some tough choices that weren't always the most popular. We\
      \ adjust to survive. In the early days the group survived fears of police raids\
      \ by being a mailing list only via private invite and interviews to make sure\
      \ members weren't police. As the dawning of the internet came, it left its days\
      \ of Fold, Stuff and Lick parties to send out the mailing to an email list.\
      \ Now in the age of social media we are moving away from an email list of close\
      \ to 400 members to a new way to schedule meet ups. Adjusting and adapting is\
      \ how any group will survive long term.\r\n\r\nThe other lifestyle choice I\
      \ will share with you is about religion. I was raised, baptized and confirmed\
      \ Catholic at St. Johns Catholic Church Goshen, IN. During my high school years\
      \ I was highly involved at church. It was my chosen family. I taught catechism\
      \ to 2nd and 7th graders. I was co-President of our youth group and I was up\
      \ for a scholarship for Catholic Youth of the Year. One of my \u201Cfriends\u201D\
      \ told my youth minister he had a concern that I was gay. I was pulled into\
      \ a meeting with our youth pastor and was forced to go to confession, right\
      \ then and there to confess any homosexual sin I may have committed, whether\
      \ I had already confessed it or thought it was a sin to begin with. In college\
      \ I was in Christian Campus Fellowship at Vincennes University. I was part of\
      \ the worship team and outreach team. When I applied to be a resident of the\
      \ house, I was told the board didn't feel it was a good idea to have an openly\
      \ gay resident. Totally disregarding that I was Christian. I'm no longer part\
      \ of any organized religion and due to these experiences question the existence\
      \ of god.\r\n\r\nIf you are gay/bi/trans/queer/transitioning know that right\
      \ now might not be the easiest. You will make it through this. If you need help\
      \ or someone to talk to do not hesitate to reach out. I am here and there are\
      \ great resources out there for you.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions or want to\
      \ share a story with me please email me. I'd love to hear from you and plan\
      \ to respond to anyone who responds.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: he gets naked, isn't religious\

<p>Because I love building community and connecting, here are a few things I would love you all to know about:</p>
<p><br />Trash for Peace: Reduce, Reuse, and Rethink the way you look at trash.</p>
<p>I volunteer with an awesome nonprofit that creates functional art from trash.  We look for ways to reduce consumption.  We reuse plastic bottles and other &#8220;trash&#8221; to create recycle bins, green houses, and more.  We encourage people to rethink the concept of trash/waste through creativity and innovation.  Google us, &#8220;like&#8221; us on facebook, or shoot us an email &#8211; we love partnering with other organizations!  We also post our manuals on our website for free, so please download them and use them in your classroom, organization, or business!</p>
<p><br />Oregon&#8217;s Health CO-OP (or any of the other Health CO-OPs nationwide)</p>
<p>I have a background in public health, and I&#8217;ve always felt like health insurance was a bit of a dirty word.  Well finally there is an alternative (sadly, only in some states) starting January 1st!  Oregon&#8217;s Health CO-OP is a nonprofit that listens to what Oregonians want in a health insurance plan, and we have made a plan to reflect that! Brilliant, right?  It focuses on innovation, building community and trust, thus helping everyone to move forward and become healthier together.</p>
<p><br />Important changes to your health insurance plan through the Affordable Care Act!</p>
<p>For women from the United States, starting January 1st, your health insurance plan is required to cover: well-woman visits; counseling and testing for sexually transmitted diseases; ALL FDA approved contraceptive or sterilization methods/procedures; breastfeeding support, supplies, and counseling (this includes breast pumps); and screening and counseling for interpersonal and domestic violence.  This is mandatory on ALL health insurance plans FREE OF CHARGE. No co-pay.  No co-insurance.  FREE &#8211; if you have health insurance, so make sure you have some type of plan!  If you live in Oregon, check out CoverOregon and see if you&#8217;re eligible for governmental assistance on your monthly premiums (I&#8217;m sure other states have similar health insurance marketplaces) &#8211; or for free insurance through Medicaid.</p>
<p><br />Dr. Vandana Shiva</p>
<p>Google her if you don&#8217;t know who she is.  Her background is fascinating and her work, inspirational! She runs a seed saving nonprofit for organic women farmers in India called Navdanya.  She also helped Bhutan create the Gross National Happiness Assessment.  Who cares about GDP if no one is happy?</p>
<p><br />Tanzania Travel Plans?</p>
<p>Any interest in visiting Kilimanjaro, Serengeti, Ngorogoro Crater, Zanzibar, + more?  Let me know!  I know the most amazing tour guide in the country.  He can make your trip as low or as high budget as you want, and I promise he&#8217;ll point out camouflaged animals you otherwise wouldn't spot or help you get to the top of the mountain.  I would put my life in his hands, no question.  I used to live in Tanzania and have traveled around with many guides.  He has true magic.</p>
<p><br />And just because I am a rule follower, here&#8217;s something important I&#8217;ve learned that I would like to share with all the other rule followers out there&#8230;</p>
<p>Just because you follow the rules, doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t color outside the lines.  There is no RULE that says you have to stay within the lines.  Often times, doing something differently leads to a new perspective. Sometimes, it leads to the creation of a masterpiece.</p>
<p>Hope to connect with you soon!</p>
<p>All my best,</p>

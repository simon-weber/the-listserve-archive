      <p>SHIT HAPPENS</p>

      <p>Rus - I''ve always tried to teach you &amp; your brothers that life is never
      fair. The secret of life that no one tells you is this. In life, shit happens.
      It just does. Nobody likes negativity, so nobody says it. But it''s the truth.</p>

      <p>When you head off to university - you will not always get into the program/class/lecture
      that you want. After that you will not get the ultimate, perfect job. You will
      sometimes get reprimanded by your bosses. Yes, your wife will be awesome, but
      she will fight with you. Sometimes, for no reason at all and then she may even
      blame you for the fight. Your colleagues at work will sometimes talk behind
      your back and try to sabotage your career. Or maybe it just seems that way to
      you. But regardless - shit happens. It always does. But the good news is that
      NONE of it matters. And it does not even matter whether the shit happens for
      a reason or not. Shit does not happen in order to make your life miserable -
      that is just a side-effect. But it will prepare you for even harder challenges
      in life - and that''s also a side-effect.</p>

      <p>Any problem, big or small, in any field, at any time always comes with a
      lesson. Every bad experience goes away trying to teach you something. As they
      say - whatever doesn''t kill you only makes you stronger. This is the proverbial
      silver lining on the dark cloud. It will always be up to you to rise above it
      all and find a solution. I have already seen you do it many times before today
      and I am confident you can repeat this. Indefinitely and forever. Try to make
      sure that any lesson or experience that came with the problem was absorbed,
      understood and saved for later. Assess the problem with a clear head, understand
      why it occurred, what (if anything) you could have done to avoid it and what
      you did to fix it. Once it is fixed, look back. Learn what you can take from
      it. Know how it impacted your life, whether temporarily or permanently? Understand
      if there was anything you could do to ensure that it does not happen again.
      If it does happen again, how can you tackle it better. Look into the details
      since all big issues are always made up of many smaller problems. If you can
      do all this and come out with a lesson learned then it has become a successful
      problem. Try to replace the word "problem" with the word "opportunity". You
      will have a learning opportunity or one to solve the problem permanently.</p>

      <p>With this philosophy, every little problem will improve your life. A failed
      interview prepares you to ace the next one. A betrayal today will improve your

      The best that you can do is avoid making the same mistake twice. Remember old
      mistakes and and try to identify new ones. This is the best way to bring the
      positives out of a bad situation. It works - always has and always will.</p>

      <p>And even if all this fails and amounts to nothing - stand proud, dust yourself
      off, stick your chest out, look in the mirror and put a big grin on your face.
      Because, out there, somewhere, someone else is having an even more shit happening
      to them, right now :-)</p>

      <p>Shit Happens. Get used to it. But remember - usually it happens for good,
      especially if you can learn something from it.</p>

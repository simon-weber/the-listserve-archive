  body: "Dear Listervians!\r\nI am a 26-year-old teacher who lives in Haarlem and\
    \ works in Amsterdam. I teach children from the age of 4 to 6. Children in this\
    \ age group learn best by playing so that is what I\u2019m helping them with.\
    \ I can use your help as well, please read on!\r\n In my class we work with projects\
    \ for about 6 to 7 weeks, we\u2019ve had projects like the circus, the castle\
    \ or the airplane. To start a project I always ask the kids what they would need\
    \ to play, so I help them build, (life-size when you\u2019re 4-6 year) airplanes,\
    \ hospitals or the witch\u2019s shack. You should see what we can do with glue\
    \ and some cardboard!\r\nThe children will then start to play, being the customs\
    \ officer, doctor or any character that is suitable for the project. By playing\
    \ inside the restaurant or the castle children develop their social skills but\
    \ that is only the beginning.\r\nFor the children the playing is very real and\
    \ they take it quite serious, together we come up with ideas of what we need.\
    \ We make passports, spell books, cookies or anything that comes to mind. Of course\
    \ to do this the children will have to write, read, draw, measure or count, in\
    \ other words, learn! On the other hand it is only just a \u2018game\u2019 so\
    \ children won\u2019t feel pressured or anxious to fail, they just need something\
    \ to enhance their play and while playing there are no mistakes! Because you can\u2019\
    t make mistakes while playing all children can learn at their own level, some\
    \ children really want to know how to write or do something while other just pretend\
    \ to do so.\r\nOur current project is the mail, and for this we could use your\
    \ help. In my class we have a stuffed bear and his name is Flip. Flip\u2019s parents\
    \ are currently traveling the world so for the time being Flip is in the capable\
    \ hands of the children in my class. They play with him, help him and some actually\
    \ see Flip as a real classmate. Flip goes home every weekend with a child. Flip\
    \ has a little book and camera and parents can help their child to write down\
    \ what adventures they had during the weekend. On Monday we read Flip\u2019s diary.\
    \ By doing so the children will get to know each other better, have a chance to\
    \ show something from their home and have a little peak inside the lives of the\
    \ others.\r\n As I mentioned before, Flips parents are traveling the world. That\u2019\
    s where you come in. It would be great if we could get postcards from all over\
    \ the world sent by you/Flip\u2019s Parents. Would you please send us something?\
    \ A postcard, letter or anything else you can imagine would be great!\r\nIt would\
    \ be absolutely amazing if we would receive even just a few letters. Please write\
    \ on the card where it is from so we can see where Flip\u2019s parents are! Flips\
    \ parents are called Ben & Sara. If you want to know how Flip looks you can Google\
    \ \u2018Flip de beer\u2019 and you will find him.\r\n\r\nYou can send your mail\

    a few ''inappropriate 999'' calls with you all:</p>

    <p>''my online shopping has not arrived...'' Really. I mean how is this a 999
    call? Unless you have ordered life saving blood plasma I am hanging up right now.</p>

    <p>''there is a cat in the street. It is meowing. It''s owner may be hurt....''
    Oh come on. It''s not fucking Lassie. </p>

    <p>''there is a dog barking. It''s owner may be hurt....'' Jesus Christ. The dog
    may be Lassie but we no longer have wells which people fall down. </p>

    <p>''There is a family of ducks crossing the road.....''. Are you seeing a pattern
    here? We Brits are a nation of animal lovers. We in the emergency services take
    a sterner view. Mamma duck will have to take her chances. </p>

    <p>''I am drunk, can I have a lift home from the police?''. Sod off. </p>

    <p>''The horror film on the TV is scaring me...'' Kill me now. </p>

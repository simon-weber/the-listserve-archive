      \ let me explain, I didn't intend it to be.  Yes, this accidentally became an\
      \ email about how proud I am of some high school students (they won a regional!\

      \  If you don\u2019t know, FIRST is an acronym for For Inspiration and Recognition\

      \ No!  Most of what I end up talking about is FUNdraising (get it, it has the\
      \ word fun in it), PR, media, community outreach, events, that sort of thing.\
      \ I would be remiss if I did not include a quote from one of our lead mentors\
      \ here:  \"We don't build robots, we build robot builders.\"\r\n\r\nI was working\
      \ with a student on preparing for interview at our next competition, and he\
      \ dropped a bunch of wisdom, including that our team is family (sappy, I know,\
      \ but true) and that we, as a team, have decided we don\u2019t care what other\
      \ people think.  We go out in public in capes and matching shirts and we name\
      \ our robots after our comic book favorites.  That\u2019s who we are and we\u2019\
      re darn proud.  I\u2019m glad this is something the students I work with are\
      \ learning early.\r\n\r\nWe're going to championships soon (mandatory reference\
      \ to being proud) and then we will be returning home to continue to defend the\
      \ robot nation.  My life is not perfect, but I am a mentor and a Defender, and\
      \ for that I am thankful.\r\n\r\nThis email doesn't have a particularly satisfying\

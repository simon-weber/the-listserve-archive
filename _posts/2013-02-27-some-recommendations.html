      \ recommendations, here's what I'd suggest:\r\n\r\nHEAR:\r\n\r\n - If you have\
      \ less than 5 minutes, listen to James Blake's new single \"Retrograde\" because\
      \ it's phenomenal.\r\n\r\n - If you have less than 20 minutes, search out the\
      \ Love Club EP by Lorde. She's a 16-year-old from New Zealand and it's awesome\
      \ pop stuff. Free on Soundcloud.\r\n\r\n - If you have less than an hour, listen\
      \ to Paul Simon's 'Graceland,' it's the best album ever made.\r\n\r\n - If you\
      \ have less than two hours, listen to Nicolas Jaar's Essential Mix. It's beautiful,\
      \ classical stuff. Also free on Soundcloud; go for the Tong-less version.\r\n\
      \r\n - If you have a few hours, go through Sam Cooke's discography. Make sure\
      \ to stop by the Harlem Club. All Sam goes best with a Sunday morning and a\
      \ mug of coffee.\r\n\r\nSEE:\r\n\r\n - If you're not watching Bob's Burgers,\
      \ you totally should. Same with Archer. Plus Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones\
      \ of course.\r\n\r\n - Cool Runnings is pretty much the best.\r\n\r\n - Read\
      \ 'American Gods' by Neil Gaiman. 'Old Mr. Flood' by Joseph Mitchell. The Princess\
      \ of Mars series by Edgar Rice Borroughs. Don't let anyone convince you young\
      \ adult fiction is for young adults.\r\n\r\nTASTE:\r\n\r\n - Cook Alton Brown's\
      \ recipe for homemade soft pretzels, they're easy and incredibly tasty.\r\n\r\
      \n - Google 'coffee-rubbed steak nom and glug' and make that. A little self\
      \ promotion, but the recipe is simple, it's less expensive than you think, and\
      \ it will impress your friends.\r\n\r\n - Kalimotxos are the ultimate summertime\
      \ drink. Half cheap red wine, half Coca-Cola, served on the rocks. Sounds horrible\
      \ and trashy, but it's actually the best thing for a sweaty summer evening.\r\
      \n\r\n  - Dark beer is always the right choice.\r\n\r\nSMELL:\r\n\r\n - Fresh\
      \ roasted coffee. Chocolate chip cookies in the oven. Wet pavement after it\
      \ rains. Pine trees. Sauteeing onions.\r\n\r\nFEEL:\r\n\r\n\u2026free to get\
      \ in touch! Always on the lookout for new recommendations. What should I cook?\
      \ What should I put on the stereo while I cook it? I'm on Twitter at @BarthDoesThings\

    \ trip from Fort Lauderdale to Portland, Maine in her deceased grandfather\u2019\
    s old car. We bought plane tickets to Florida and gave ourselves a week to enjoy\
    \ the drive back. It was exciting.\r\n\r\nBefore even leaving Fort Lauderdale\
    \ we had to stop and replace the aged windshield wipers. Our speedy problem solving\
    \ perhaps gave us a false sense of confidence and ability upon embarking on our\
    \ first road trip. In theory, flying to Florida to drive a car to Maine does not\
    \ seem like a unique or major challenge. At least, it shouldn\u2019t.\r\n\r\n\
    Windshield wipers fixed, we merged onto the clear-cut path up I-95 that would\
    \ take us directly home. Open windows, feet on the dash \u2013 we were free! As\
    \ I attempted to rig a Discman and speakers in the glove compartment, the car,\
    \ so old that it simply provided an AM/FM radio for listening entertainment, began\
    \ to shudder. And shake. And rattle. We looked at each other \u2013 something\
    \ wasn\u2019t right.\r\n\r\n\u201CAll we have to do is make it to Maine, then\
    \ we\u2019ll never take you on the highway again,\u201D I thought, pleading with\
    \ the car to keep moving. We figured out that if we stayed under 60 mph on the\
    \ highway, the shuddering was undetectable. Good thing we gave ourselves a week\
    \ to get back.\r\n\r\nAfter a night in Savannah, we took up our slow (yet legally)\
    \ paced journey north. About three hours down the road, my best friend at the\
    \ wheel, something gave out. We took the first exit we saw into Florence, South\
    \ Carolina to look for help. \u201CIt\u2019s like we just lost half our momentum,\u201D\
    \ my friend told the clerk at AutoZone, who directed us northern out-of-towners\
    \ down the road a few blocks to a mechanic \u2013 \u201CTell him Anita sent you.\u201D\
    \r\n\r\nOur quick windshield wiper fix the previous day gave us hope that we\u2019\
    d be back on the road soon. After leaving the car at the shop we walked to the\
    \ Piggly Wiggly for supplies, planning road snacks for the next few days. An hour\
    \ later, we returned to the shop.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ve got no compression\
    \ in your third valve,\u201D the lady at the front desk drawled. Blank stares.\r\
    \n\r\nShe clarified: \u201CThat\u2019s bad.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe mechanic gave us\
    \ our options: fix the car for $2500 (more than it was even worth), or drive it\
    \ until it dies. \u201CIt could die in 20 miles or in 5,000,\u201D he said. Another\
    \ thousand miles to Portland, we opted for the less pricey option, hoping the\
    \ inevitable failure of the shaky old car would happen closer to the 5,000 mark.\r\
    \n\r\nThe engine gave out about 300 miles down the road in North Carolina. We\
    \ coasted to a stop in the breakdown lane and sat there in silence. That thick\
    \ southern drawl echoed through my head: no compression in the third valve \u2013\
    \ that's bad\u2026no compression\u20265,000 miles\u2026\r\n\r\nWe had it towed\

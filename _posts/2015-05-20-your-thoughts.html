      <p>A little about me. I&#8217;m 23, born + raised in Vancouver, Canada. I spent

      Work at your most efficient. Challenge others. Learning another language is
      difficult, especially in a city where lack of knowledge of said language is
      a burden before you can even recognize it to be so. Humility plays a huge part
      in it all. So does perseverance. And pride, unfortunately.</p>

      <p>Side note - I feel my entire life, I&#8217;ve flip flopped between the need

      tell you that I feel the need to contribute in some substantial way to current
      culture.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;d like to ask you all: what you think about before you fall asleep?</p>

      <p>I shoot 35mm film - you can find my pictures at thegofg dot tumblr dot com</p>

      <p>My ex boyfriend is plenty more talented. His name is Stan Troitsky - you
      can google him, or his website Mook Life, for some very real life photography&#8230;</p>

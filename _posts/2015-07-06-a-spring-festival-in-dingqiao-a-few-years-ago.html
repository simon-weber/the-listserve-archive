      \ to see light snow drifting through the open windows. But the warmth of my\
      \ welcome makes up for it.\r\n\r\n\u201CEveryone, Bing He has come.\u201D\r\n\
      \r\n\u201CBing He, happy new year! Come sit down, have some tea!\u201D\r\n\r\
      \n\u201CAuntie! Happy new year!\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CHappy new year, everyone.\
      \ I\u2019m very happy to be here.\u201D I get an adorable, toothy grin from\
      \ my 9 year old niece. Tiny and well-mannered, she doesn\u2019t accept my red\
      \ envelope stuffed with cash until I force it into her hands.\r\n\r\nThey settle\
      \ me on the sofa, and I watch my uncle arranging chopsticks and bowls of golden\
      \ liquor around the many plates of food on the dining table. A place for each\
      \ ancestor, I think, but I\u2019m too shy to ask. I clutch a paper cup of hot\
      \ green tea tightly in my hands as snow settles inside the room.\r\n\r\nMy niece\
      \ watches tv, and my aunt interrogates me on my job and boyfriend. I evade her\
      \ questions about where I stay when I\u2019m visiting him in Shanghai. More\
      \ relations knock on the door. More welcomes and hellos and Happy New Years!.\
      \ I smile, say hello, fail to understand their dialect-accented Chinese, and\
      \ huddle closer to my niece for warmth.\r\n\r\nRelatives and friends pass in\
      \ and out. My aunt lights a pair of fat red candles on the table, and drags\
      \ a huge metal bowl into the middle of the floor. Uncle carries out a bundle\
      \ of red strings and gold and silver paper. They look very different from the\
      \ paper \u201CHell\u2019s Banknotes\u201D that my mother used to buy in London\u2019\
      s Chinatown.\r\n\r\nWithout much ceremony, aunt and uncle light the money for\
      \ our ancestors on fire. Ashes drop into the metal bowl, and smoke starts drifting\
      \ across the living room, obscuring the dancers fluttering on the tv.\r\n\r\n\
      I suddenly have one of those moments - a complete and utter awareness of being\
      \ and place. If you like to travel, you might know what I mean. I am entirely\
      \ aware with my whole being that I am in Dingqiao, in my uncle and aunt\u2019\
      s apartment, sitting on the sofa, with miles of residential blocks just like\
      \ the one I was sitting in stretching all around. The gardens and apple trees\
      \ of Wimbledon are very far away, and my breath is cold in my mouth.\r\n\r\n\
      It\u2019s not a bad feeling. Sometimes I think that I travel just to experience\
      \ moments like that.\r\n\r\nWe clear away the ashes and candles. Uncle disappears\
      \ into the kitchen, and soon delicious aromas waft out. More relations arrive,\
      \ my niece\u2019s parents and more of my cousins, and it\u2019s time to eat.\r\
      \n\r\nThere is turtle and crab and salted pork, and much more. My favourite\
      \ is niangao, soft rice sticks in sauce, very auspicious for a long life, they\
      \ tell me. There are smiles around the table, and I take photos of everything\
      \ for my mother.  \u201CNew year is so lively,\u201D we all agree.\r\n\r\nAfter\
      \ watching hours of the New Year Gala on tv, where I\u2019m disconcerted to\
      \ see Celine Dion singing in Chinese, I go to bed. Bed is a wooden mattress,\
      \ piled with quilts. I cover the bed with my clothes for extra warmth. I drift\
      \ off to sleep to the sound of fireworks, exploding like cheers in the night\
      \ sky outside.\r\n\r\n\r\nCassia \u79C9\u548C\r\ncbhc2000@163.com\r\nHangzhou\r\

      \ these desires from the very beginning. It's perhaps what Plato referred to\

      \ Are you paying attention to your friend so that he or she may pay attention\

      \ your own whims and fancies? Perhaps we exist for the service of others? To\
      \ be free then, is to be free from the shackles of the self. Only when you\u2019\
      re truly free may these so called 'cliches' of Compassion, Generosity, and Justice\

      <p>This leads us to the insight: You should focus more on the non-fantastic

      <p>Here''s the thing: Most of the boring stuff in your life is so dull, that
      even the tiniest thing can make it seem fun. The tiniest thing. This means the
      you could make it better with extremely simple means.</p>

      <p>What exactly am I talking about here? Little things. Like these:</p>

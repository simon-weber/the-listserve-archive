      \ friends nearby. It\u2019s lonely, and I feel little motivation to get out\
      \ of bed and go to work some days. I keep myself very scheduled with other activities,\

      \ I just finished teaching my first undergraduate course by myself, on Developmental\

      I\u2019ve completed a half marathon in under 2 hours, and who\u2019s to say\

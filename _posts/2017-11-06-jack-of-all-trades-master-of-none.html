    body: "Hey Listserv Readers \u2013\r\n\r\nMy name is Claire Brooks and I am a\
      \ creative producer from NYC.\r\n\r\nWhat does a producer do exactly? Good question\
      \ \u2013 I\u2019m not always sure and I\u2019ve been doing this for 6 years.\
      \ Most days, it feels like a bit of everything. A good tag line for most Producers\
      \ would be \"Jack of all Trades and Master of None.\"\r\n\r\nThe role of the\
      \ producer varies by field. I\u2019ve worked as an experiential producer, a\
      \ digital producer, and a commercial producer. I\u2019ve also produced a few\
      \ short films. Yet, no matter how big the budget, a toilet will break somewhere,\
      \ at some point, and become my problem to deal with. This is why I don\u2019\
      t trust a producer who can\u2019t plunge a toilet and close deals at the same\
      \ time.\r\n\r\nProducing requires a sense of humor and humility. An easily bruised\
      \ ego is a useless attribute for a producer. This is because producing is a\
      \ service occupation. As a producer, I am in service to my clients, my creative\
      \ team, my staff and my employees. At the very least, I am in service to myself.\r\
      \n\r\nBy upholding a high standard of excellence while on production, I can\
      \ make a tough day manageable, maybe even pleasant, for my colleagues. Trust\
      \ me, I don\u2019t like working brutal 14-hour days, out in the field, with\
      \ only crap catering to sustain me either. If you think feeding subway sandwiches\
      \ and pizza to your hardworking crew day after day is okay, then you\u2019re\
      \ not a bad producer, you\u2019re a bad person.\r\n\r\nAs a producer, I live\
      \ by one simple guiding principle: Treat people well and with respect. I wish\
      \ all producers felt the same.\r\n\r\nI appreciate that my job is to ensure\
      \ a safe and collaborative working environment so that we can deliver a stellar\
      \ project on time and under budget. I love creating spaces where people (myself\
      \ included) can do their best work. And in most producing scenarios, something\
      \ that can go wrong, will go wrong. In good news, I also enjoy being the person\
      \ tasked with quick problem solving. This way, we can stay on track and do whatever\
      \ big crazy creative thing we set out to do in the first place.\r\n\r\nAs a\
      \ producer, I hold the most responsibility for the project and I enjoy that.\
      \ The contracts are in my company\u2019s name so if anyone\u2019s getting sued,\
      \ it\u2019s me. If the cops show up to check our compliance with the permits\
      \ \u2013 it\u2019s me they\u2019re talking to. When something goes wrong (which\
      \ it will), I\u2019m the one getting yelled at by a pissed off property owner,\
      \ angry neighbor, or frustrated celeb.\r\n\r\nThis has never bothered me. I\u2019\
      ve always known that big risks come with big rewards. Also, the perks! Once,\
      \ a sponsor gifted me a 6 month supply of wine. Even my apartment is largely\
      \ decorated with freebies from various productions. I can\u2019t even recall\
      \ the last time I paid for a sweatshirt because I get so many for free. #SwagIsLife\r\
      \n\r\nIt\u2019s been a wild ride and a career that\u2019s taken me from NYC\
      \ to London to Los Angeles and back to NYC again. I have no family or inside\
      \ connections to this industry. My entire career has been strategically and\
      \ meticulously designed by me starting back when I was 16.\r\n\r\nI am humbled\
      \ to think of my own upbringing. How did a girl from a small housing projects\
      \ deep in Queens, raised by two very young but loving parents, end up in the\
      \ places I have? From an inner city NYC public school to a fancy New England\
      \ private boarding school and from a cramped dark apartment in Flushing, Queens\
      \ to treehouse-like sanctuary in Santa Monica... It's been quite the ride.\r\
      \n\r\nNow, I\u2019m on the next leg of my journey. I recently started my MFA\
      \ at Columbia University with the aim of transitioning from advertising to Film\
      \ & TV. I would love to share this ride with anyone that\u2019s interested!\r\
      \n\r\nSo if you're reading this and want to shoot me a question via email, please\
      \ do. I\u2019ll will respond with either a blog / vlog to your question. It\
      \ can be about anything, seriously! Some ideas: Living and working abroad, grad\
      \ school, MFA programs, the advertising industry, Hollywood, creative entrepreneurship\
      \ / stewardship, embarking on your own creative career, and etc. Or maybe you\
      \ just want to tell me about your favorite TV shows, a movie I should watch,\
      \ or get my recommendation for something I think you should check out. It's\
      \ all fair game to me!\r\n\r\n(And an extra special thank you / shout out to\
      \ my friend Jono for introducing me to the listserv. It took almost 6 years,\

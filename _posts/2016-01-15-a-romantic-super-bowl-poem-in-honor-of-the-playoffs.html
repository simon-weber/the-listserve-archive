      \ strange nationality.\r\nFathering a sense of belonging,\r\n\tOr a sense of\
      \ carnal immersion\r\n\tBarreling down into a world ruled by bitter men\r\n\t\
      Wielding clipboards and headsets\u2014\r\n\tMade all powerful by the super-human\
      \ armies at their disposal.\r\nIn Houston, the coup was staged:\r\n\tThe panther\
      \ camp versus the patriot camp.\r\nAn alliterative epic,\r\n\tWhere a goal is\
      \ a goal,\r\n\tAnd time is life.\r\nThe blurred lines of entertainment and reality\r\
      \n\tTransport us hypnogogically\r\n\tBeyond our known limits of hedonistic exposure.\r\
      \nHere, envy, greed, wrath, and gluttony\r\n\tMeet our lust and pride.\r\nWhile\
      \ sloth sinks us into our chair\r\n\tTo watch the real demons battle\r\n\tOver\
      \ things we claim as our own.\r\nAnd the only thing more insipid than the world\

      \ But like many other fans, I have had my enjoyment complicated by the reports\

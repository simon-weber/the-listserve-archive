      <p>Authenticity. Within the beautiful mess of our globalized world we are unavoidably
      surrounded by an immeasurable number of vastly intertwined cultures of near
      and far, past and present, fusions and appropriations. In it &#8216;authenticity&#8217;
      is being used all around us (in Wester rhetoric at least), and I am endlessly
      baffled by how differently we all understand this singe word, how its influences
      cultural production, audience perception, and the way we navigate within society.
      So I focused my research on it.</p>

      <p>Take a painter for example. Consider, how you may label him/her authentic,
      based on their ability to convey honesty and truthfulness, through creating
      uniqueness by their power of creativity. Consider then again a dish prepared
      exactly as it was by your great-grandmother, the list of ingredients passed
      down through the generations, an authentic meal, as far as it is true to its
      original, right? Or the performance of a traditional folk song accompanied by
      musicians on instruments of the time &#8211; is that not authentic?</p>

      <p>But what happens if the painter uses stencils, prints, mechanical modes of
      reproduction? When work of art is used to create another? What if you serve
      your great-grandmothers recipe with a side dish traditional to a culture half
      was across the world, a dish she could not have known about, let alone serving
      it with, does that ruin the authenticity of your meal? What if the folk song
      is performed in jeans and t-shirts?</p>

      <p>Can authenticity mean creativity and being true to an original at the same
      time? Does your interpretation of authenticity influence how you view art? How
      you understand culture? How you interpret and judge other people?</p>

      <p>The fact is, that there are many definitions, many approaches, but no precise
      measurements for any of them. Next time, however, when you hear &#8220;wow,
      this is so authentic&#8221;, consider the cultural context of the subject of
      praise, consider its origin, the myriad ways in which it can exist, what it
      may mean to people of different cultures and backgrounds, from different times.
      Perhaps it will open you up towards new interpretations of the cultures, the
      people, the behaviors around you.</p>

      <p>Want to dive into some definitions and concepts? Google &#8220;authenticity&#8221;
      in combination with any of the following:  Eminem, hip hop, heritage, tourism,
      objective, first/second/third person. Enjoy!</p>

      <p>As my body works. I&#8217;m beginning a project which involves a long time
      fascination of mine: thinking about how our day-to-day activities influence

<p>Hello there, Listservers! I hope you&#8217;ll enjoy<br />A message that&#8217;s based on a Seussian ploy</p>
<p>If you want to write poems the Seussian way<br />Anapestic tetrameter brooks no delay</p>
<p>But Seuss saw this form in its hard, rigid glory<br />And said &#8216;Hey, I can do it, and tell quite a story</p>
<p>&#8216;While doing it, too, it will be my new tool<br />In telling kids things that they won&#8217;t learn in school&#8217;</p>
<p>When he came to a line that just wouldn&#8217;t quite flourish<br />He&#8217;d pluck up a word from thin air, and he&#8217;d nourish</p>
<p>That young little word, brand new to the world<br />And he&#8217;d place it in just the right spot, where it whirled</p>
<p>Where it danced and it sang like a fresh coat of paint<br />Over language grown solemn and tempered and quaint</p>
<p>The words he invented were zong, zax and zillow<br />And grinch, nerd and vipper, they were bofa and yekko</p>
<p>They told all the stories he needed to tell<br />And they broke through a form that would otherwise dwell</p>
<p>In the musty old drawers of the humorless past<br />He made it seem joyous, a form that would last</p>
<p>In the memories of every young kid who was read<br />From a Dr. Seuss book before going to bed</p>
<p>And so, if I&#8217;m going to be true to my muse<br />I&#8217;ll leave with a moral that you all might just use</p>
<p>Dr. Seuss saw a dark thing and turned it to light<br />If we all do the same, the world sure will be bright.</p>

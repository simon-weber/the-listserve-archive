      \ have a dream career, not just an interest in something, but a real dream,\
      \ then quit what you are doing and go after it.  I did that about 6 years ago,\
      \ and it has made my entire left better.\r\n\r\nIf a family member of someone\
      \ you know dies, go to the wake.  Just do it, even if just for 10 minutes. \
      \ That person you know is likely going through a very tough time and it might\
      \ make them feel better to see you.  Just go! Don\u2019t make excuses, it\u2019\
      s the right thing to do.\r\n\r\nIf you hold a door for someone, carry an old\
      \ person\u2019s groceries, or just do a generally nice deed for someone, don\u2019\
      t put it on social media.  It makes being nice to people extraordinary, when\
      \ it is what you\u2019re supposed to do.\r\n\r\nIf you are feeling down or just\
      \ need a pick me up, go to YouTube and search: Cochlear Implant Hearing for\
      \ the First Time\r\nHave yourself a nice happy cry, it can be therapeutic, I\
      \ promise.\r\n\r\nKnowing what you want to do in life can be a good thing, but\
      \ knowing what you don\u2019t want to do can be even more beneficial.  Keep\
      \ track of things you don\u2019t want to do and steer clear.\r\n\r\nThere are\
      \ going to be times when the best thing you can say is nothing at all.  I had\
      \ a huge oral argument in a case, the opposing attorney and I stepped up and\
      \ the Judge immediately starting attacking the other attorney.  I had prepared\
      \ for days for this and i had so much I wanted to say, but earlier I had gotten\
      \ this advice from someone.  I didn\u2019t say a word, not one.  I won and made\
      \ all the partners proud.  So sometimes it's best to just keep your mouth shut!\r\
      \n\r\nIt is important to be honest, but know your audience.  That\u2019s why\
      \ there is a term \u201CBrutal Honesty.\u201D Don\u2019t be \"\"That Guy\"\"\
      \ (or \"\"That Gal\"\"). But at the same point don't ask a question you are\
      \ not prepared to hear the answer to. You might not want to hear the answer\
      \ \"\"That Guy or Gal\"\" gives to \"\"Do I look fat in this?\"\"\r\n\r\nLife\
      \ is going to happen, it finds a way to creep up on us, and sometimes even trip\
      \ us up.  Don\u2019t fight it, if you are waiting for everything to be perfect\
      \ in your life before you make a change, I guarantee, you will die unchanged.\r\
      \n\r\nThere is going to be a point in your life when you have time to help others,\
      \ do it, even if just for a day a year.  Helping others can make you feel better\
      \ than the people you help.  I've worked with a non-profit in my spare time\
      \ for a few years.  It's now a selfish act, because I feel so good when I get\
      \ done.\r\n\r\nWhen you boil it down, life is about the fundamentals we learned\
      \ in grade school. Be nice to each other, don't be a show-off, pay attention,\
      \ listen when others are speaking, set goals, take risks, and work hard.  It's\
      \ kind of really that simple.\r\n\r\nI saw this once and thought it was funny.\r\
      \nA woman approached a Man smoking and asked him \u201CHow long have you been\

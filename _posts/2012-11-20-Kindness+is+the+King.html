<p>Dear fellow Listservians ~</p>
<p>Here is a poem I wrote recently, and now I wish to share it with you:</p>
<p>Kindness is The King.<br />May you let it rule your Kingdom.<br />Gloriously!<br />In spite of all those Dragons<br />That aim to break your Heart.</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. I always look forward to reading what you have to say. I hope that peace may find you wherever you go.</p>

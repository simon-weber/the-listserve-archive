    body: "I was a pretty good kid. Other than occasional acts of extreme rudeness\
      \ (hanging up the phone on my father before he was done talking \u2013 this\
      \ is the only time I can remember being shouted at by him) or impulsive, ill-informed\
      \ choices that scared the crap out of my parents (coming very close to jumping\
      \ off of the top of our swingset with a plastic bag as my \u2018parachute\u2019\
      ), I didn\u2019t give my parents or teachers any real cause for alarm or discipline.\
      \ I was a quiet, dreamy-eyed kid who fidgeted a lot and tried to be kind to\
      \ everybody.\r\n\r\nAs I was born with severe allergies to fur, dust, pollen,\
      \ and the like, we were never allowed to get the dog I so longed for. Forming\
      \ close relationships with stuffed animals was also out of the question. While\
      \ I was permitted to drag Brown Bear around during the day (my parents weren\u2019\
      t totally heartless), I have distinct memories of my little guy being gently\
      \ tugged from my grasp as I pretended to sleep, then watching through half-closed\
      \ eyes as my mother or father placed him a safe distance away on my dresser.\r\
      \n\r\nI was going to have to find another way to fill this hole in my heart.\r\
      \n\r\nFast forward to second grade. It is just after 8 AM, and I am in the middle\
      \ of a three-seater on the back of the school bus hugging a small plastic terrarium\
      \ to my chest. Inside of it are small rocks, a few pieces of moss, a dish with\
      \ water in it, and a frog-- The frog is strikingly colorful\u2014navy blue with\
      \ bright orange and red markings on its back\u2014and its big, black eyes bulge\
      \ with fear. It is completely and perfectly still, but none of the kids around\
      \ me seem to mind this fact.\r\n\r\n\u201CIs it poisonous?\u201D they ask.\r\
      \n\u201CI\u2019m not sure,\u201D I answer.\r\n\u201CIs he scared?\u201D\r\n\u201C\
      Yeah, really scared\u2026 He trusts me though.\u201D\r\n\r\nTo the delight of\
      \ my classmates, my second grade-teacher is totally in favor of putting the\
      \ frog terrarium on display for everyone to enjoy. She clears a space for it\
      \ on top of the tables in the back of the room, and for the rest of the day\
      \ the class is abuzz with talk of the exciting new visitor. Everyone is eager\
      \ to stop by the little tank and check on how the frog is adjusting to his new\
      \ environment, and there are so many trips to the water fountain and bathroom\
      \ that eventually my teacher has to revoke the privilege.\r\n\r\nI, too, visit\
      \ the frog terrarium several times that day: once during lunch, when I\u2019\
      ve come inside to use the bathroom and once during group activity period, when\
      \ everyone is moving about the room and too busy to notice me move the frog.\
      \ Each time, someone inevitably notices it and sends a current of excitement\
      \ through the room.\r\n\r\n\u201CHe moved! He moved! He\u2019s closer to his\
      \ water!\u201D\r\n\u201CHe must be getting thirsty!\u201D\r\nEach time, I am\
      \ equally thrilled and relieved.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the afternoon, the\
      \ class\u2019 fascination with the minute movements of my frog has only grown,\
      \ and finally my teacher makes an exciting proposition. Why don\u2019t we move\
      \ Mr. Frog to a bigger home, she says. We\u2019ve got an empty old fish tank\
      \ in the science classroom, so why don\u2019t we just clean it out and give\
      \ him more space to roam?\r\n\r\nCleaning out the fish tank is the last activity\
      \ of the day. Surrounded by a class of enthralled seven year olds, my teacher\
      \ wipes the glass with a damp paper towel and asks for suggestions on how we\
      \ might fix a loose hinge on the lid. My classmates are full of ideas, but I\
      \ am silent and sick to my stomach.\r\n\r\nLater that day I am lying on the\
      \ rug, eating coffee yogurt and watching CatDog when my babysitter comes in\
      \ with the phone in her hand. I didn\u2019t even hear it ring, but apparently\
      \ my teacher is on the phone.\r\n\r\n \u201CKatherine?\u201D\r\n\r\nHer voice\
      \ sounds very soft and far away. I try to pretend I\u2019m not sure what this\
      \ call is about.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou\u2019ll never believe what happened to me\
      \ this afternoon.\u201D\r\n\r\nI am standing barefoot in my backyard and the\
      \ rocks are cool and scratchy on my skin.\r\n\r\n\u201CI stayed after school\
      \ to put the new tank together, and it was all ready for your frog.\u201D\r\n\
      \r\n\u201COh\u2026 you did?\u201D  I am feeling very sorry both for her and\
      \ for myself.\r\n\r\n\u201CBut then I reached in, all still and careful so I\
      \ didn\u2019t scare him, and when I touched him\u2014when I touched him, he\
      \ was made of plastic.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe falls silent, and I am well-aware that\
      \ my great trick has come to an end; there is nothing further I can do to keep\
      \ the frog alive. Unwilling to pursue it any further now that the magic of the\
      \ situation has been deflated, I am backed into the inevitable corner of The\
      \ Truth. Eager to escape this mortifying conversation as soon as possible, I\
      \ stammer, in what feels like a complete cop-out,\r\n\r\n\u201CBut\u2026 but\u2026\
      \ the people at the pet store said it was real..\u201D\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not sure\
      \ if I\u2019m trying to get out of trouble or whether I am simply too embarrassed\
      \ to admit to the tale I\u2019ve told. Either way, my response has the intended\
      \ effect of making my teacher stop talking about it. After I say this, the conversation\
      \ remains gentle and quiet but ends relatively quickly.\r\n\r\nLater that week,\
      \ my teacher calls my mom to express her concern that I am struggling with reality.\
      \ Her exact words are that I am \u201Chaving some trouble distinguishing reality\
      \ from fiction.\u201D\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know if my mom realizes the extent\
      \ to which I carried The Frog Trick; she is perfectly comfortable with my grasp\
      \ on reality and is more sympathetic to my obvious desperation for a pet.\r\n\
      \r\nTwo weeks later, we get a real tree frog. Christened Frisky due to his spastic\
      \ jumping behaviors, he lives a solid five years and is well-loved by the Frog\
      \ Master.\r\n\r\nKatherine McDonald\r\nkemcdonald11@gmail.com\r\nOakland, CA\r\

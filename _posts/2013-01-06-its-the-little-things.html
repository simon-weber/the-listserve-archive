  body: "When I first received the email saying I won the Listserve lottery, I honestly\
    \ had no idea what to do. I\u2019ll admit I initially joined the Listserve quite\
    \ selfishly because I just wanted to read the stories of others. Having read every\
    \ email that came in, and seeing all the life lessons and creativity pouring from\
    \ every single one of them, I was left quite dismayed. What could I write about?\
    \ What could I possibly put into words that others would want to read? I've probably\
    \ started this about 12 times but I think I know what to say now.\r\n\r\nMy name\
    \ is Keegan. I am a 4th year college student pursuing a BS degree in Chemistry,\
    \ graduating in May, 21 years old, caught somewhere between a woman and a girl,\
    \ and currently writing to you all in the comfort of a blanket fort.\r\n\r\nYou\
    \ see, I've had kind of a terrible day today. It started out by dropping someone\
    \ very dear to me off at the airport and, as I\u2019m sure most of you know, that\
    \ leads to quite the difficult day. Especially when things have been left unresolved\
    \ and you won\u2019t see them again until July. That, coupled with the fact classes\
    \ will be starting again soon and not really anyone is back from break yet, has\
    \ led to some serious moping around.\r\n\r\nNow I\u2019m not really the kind of\
    \ person to make new years resolutions, but considering I received the email saying\
    \ I won the Listserve lottery on January 1st, I figured that now seemed like a\
    \ pretty good time to do so.\r\n\r\nSo here they are: short, sweet, simple.\r\n\
    \r\nBe more confident.\r\n\r\nSmile more.\r\n\r\nEnjoy the little things.\r\n\r\
    \nThat brings me to my current location. I was perusing the internet, scrolling\
    \ through countless pages and getting to that point of actually being bored with\
    \ just sitting in bed being upset. I was thinking to myself, what can make me\
    \ happy? What can get me out of this rut? And then it hit me. Blanket fort. I\
    \ sat there for about a minute or two just thinking about it saying to myself,\
    \ \u201CCome on, Keegan. You can\u2019t actually make a fort. Think of something\
    \ practical.\u201D But then I thought, \u201CWhy not?.... Why can\u2019t I? I\u2019\
    m enough of an adult to say that I can do what I want and right now, I want a\
    \ blanket fort.\u201D And thus, construction began.\r\n\r\nIt took me about 7\
    \ minutes to work out my happy place here. My comforter strung from my bed, to\
    \ my desk, to my bookshelf. A sheet between the footboard and mirror leaning on\
    \ the wall, forming the tunnel to my escape. Textbooks holding everything down.\
    \ I added a chair in the middle, creating a sort of tent like appearance and even\
    \ took my bedside lamps into the fort for lighting. The final touch came in throwing\
    \ all my remaining blankets and pillows inside and falling into them in pure happiness.\r\
    \n\r\nI felt like a little kid but my night has been instantly better since.\r\
    \n\r\nSo why am I telling all of you this? I want you to think about this when\
    \ you are feeling down. When you've had a rough day and just feel like you've\
    \ reached that quitting point. Remember that you should always take a minute or\
    \ two to just do something for yourself to make yourself happy, because you\u2019\
    ll never be too old for such things. Whether you take the long way home through\
    \ the park, get an extra scoop of ice-cream, or build yourself a blanket fort,\
    \ I challenge you to not neglect the little things that will keep you going through\
    \ 2013.\r\n\r\nPlease email me! Let me know how you've taken up my challenge or\
    \ even if you just want to talk about anything and everything. I\u2019m always\
    \ looking for ways to brighten up the days of the people around me. Happy New\
    \ Year everybody!!\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeegan\t\r\nkeegan.listserve@gmail.com\t\

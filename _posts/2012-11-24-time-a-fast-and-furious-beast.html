<p>Ouch, I just skipped a heartbeat when I saw the "You've been selected" mail. </p>
<p>I don't know what to write. Well, anyway, here it goes! </p>
<p>Hi, I'm Vitor, I'm a 31yo Brazilian, and I just got through a quarter life crisis.</p>
<p>We're told to exaustion that time is a fast and furious beast that eats your life away every second, and around this age it gets really evident. </p>
<p>Finding a balance between dedication to my projects and actually getting a life without feeling like I'm wasting time is hard, and I am still struggling to find out where is the right point is.</p>
<p>I feel I had to throw away some things in life so I could grab new things to carry on. What I have learned is that there are three things you shoudn't throw away never ever, or you might lose forever:</p>
<p>- your health <br />- your family <br />- your friends</p>
<p>I finally realized that sleeping, eating well, doing exercises and go offline sometimes is essential.</p>
<p>I also found out that being kind to people around you is important too, or else *they* might feel like throwing *you* away.</p>
<p>Well, that's it! Feel free to contact me.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>(I feel like playing on lottery right now!)</p>

    <p>Hi, I''m Vitor, I''m a 31yo Brazilian, and I just got through a quarter life

    <p>I feel I had to throw away some things in life so I could grab new things to
    carry on. What I have learned is that there are three things you shoudn''t throw
    away never ever, or you might lose forever:</p>

    <p>- your health <br />- your family <br />- your friends</p>

    <p>I finally realized that sleeping, eating well, doing exercises and go offline
    sometimes is essential.</p>

    <p>I also found out that being kind to people around you is important too, or

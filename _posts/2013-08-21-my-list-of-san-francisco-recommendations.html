<p>Hey y&#8217;all,</p>
<p>For those of you that haven&#8217;t been to San Francisco, here is a list of my favorite things to do in the area:</p>
<p>1. Eat Bi-Rite ice cream in Dolores Park<br />2. Tan yourself with other hip San Francisco residents at Dolores Park<br />3. Visit Bi-Rite grocery store in the Mission<br />4. Visit Golden Gate park and climb to the top of the DeYoung Museum<br />5. Stare at beautiful art at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (&#8220;SFMoMA&#8221;)<br />6. Window shop on Valencia St in The Mission - start at 16th and Valencia and walk to 25th and Valencia<br />7. Visit the Ferry Building Farmers Market (on Saturdays) under the Bay Bridge<br />8. Take a cable car on the California Line to Pac Heights and meander back down Fillmore St<br />9. Eat dim-sum in the largest China Town in the USA (Koi Palace in Daly City which is South of San Francisco is considered excellent for this)<br />10. See a concert at the Great American Music Hall<br />11. check out the jazz at Yoshi&#8217;s<br />12. Catch the SF Symphony at the beautiful Davies Hall<br />13.

Hiking (or cycling) around Mt Tam (Tamalpais)<br />16. Oyster shucking in Tomales Bay. Because I&#8217;m vegetarian, I have no idea, but this is recommended by friends with good taste<br />17. Hiking around Muir Woods<br />18. Napa. wine country<br />19. Sonoma. wine country and fewer tourists.<br />20. Go to the Tourist Club in Mill Valley -- a German-style beer haus nestled in Muir Woods<br />21. Attend a sing along at The Castro Theatre<br />22. Kite surf at Crissy Field (lessons + wetsuit recommended)<br />23. Surf in Pacifica (lessons + wetsuit recommended)<br />24. Go road cycling in Marin<br />25. Yosemite, Yosemite, Yosemite<br />26. Bike across the Golden Gate Bridge, take the Sausalito ferry back<br />27. Catch an improv comedy show at BATS Theater around Fort Mason</p>
<p>To eat:<br />1. Ice Cream at Humphry Slocombe (don&#8217;t miss this place!)<br />2. Explore the Ferry Building with little speciality food shops inside<br />3. Burma Superstar - amazing Burmese food<br />4. Foreign Cinema in The Mission - Californian cuisine and delicious<br />5. Nopa in Western Addition - brunch brunch<br />6.

City Beer - beer store/bar in SOMA. very wide beer selection. closes early<br />5. Toronado in the Lower Haight - beer bar<br />6. Bourbon and Branch - cocktail bar<br />7.

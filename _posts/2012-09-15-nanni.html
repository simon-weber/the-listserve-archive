<p>My grandmother is my best friend. I call her Nanni. Most people aren&#8217;t as lucky as I am to have such a special person in their life, but I am and she is kind, wise, beautiful, intelligent, perfect. I am not telling her that I&#8217;m writing this about her because she is so selfless that she would probably talk me into writing about something else, like Obama or art or women&#8217;s health or exercising one&#8217;s right to vote &#8211; all important things that she would want to share with 22,000 listeners. Nanni is a renaissance woman. She can do anything, but I&#8217;m going to tell you some things that Nanni has taught me, and I live my life by these principles:</p>
<p>Be passionate.<br />Don&#8217;t let anyone&#8217;s opinion stand in the way of doing what you want.<br />If you care about something, fight for it.<br />If you love someone, tell them.<br />If you want to do something, the world is yours and you can do it.<br />Commit to something and follow through.<br />You daresn&#8217;t let anyone hold you back.<br />Embrace struggle and do what you can with the resources you&#8217;ve got.<br />Life is short.<br />Always try clothes on - they never look the same on your body as they do on the hanger.<br />Being unhappy is a choice, accepting failure and defeat isn't.<br />Ask questions, read a lot, travel, stay organized and informed.<br />If you don&#8217;t think you can, try harder.</p>
<p>Grandparents are really special people. Don&#8217;t forget to call yours and tell them you love &#8216;em.</p>

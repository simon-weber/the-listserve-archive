    \ to code on my startup project full time.\r\nNot only does that give me the time\
    \ to do this but it also gives me peace of mind.\r\nI change my location about\

    \ have no job and I have no income.\r\nStill I'm exactly where I should be. I'm\
    \ on my path. My gut feeling lets me know that.\r\n\r\nI'm not exiting to a normal\
    \ life until my startup has taken off. This is my big adventure. I'm not coming\
    \ back empty handed.\r\n\r\nSmall notes on how to do this:\r\n    I power my laptop,\
    \ phone and external battery with two portable Brunton 62 Watt solar panels.\r\
    \n    I cook nice food on my Primus OmniLite stove.\r\n    I live in a comfortable\
    \ Hilleberg tent.\r\n    I carry all 35 kg in a Norrona Recon back pack.\r\n\r\
    \nThere's my live, 35 kg. It should not take more to slay the dragon, win the\

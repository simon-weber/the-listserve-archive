<p>I recently quit my job and my apartment to live in the forest in a tent.</p>
<p>Actually tonight I'm in a wind shelter by a still and beautiful lake and in front of me there is a small fire, the sun is setting,<br />and on my lap, my laptop.</p>
<p>I'm a developer. I moved to a tent into the forest to be able to code on my startup project full time.<br />Not only does that give me the time to do this but it also gives me peace of mind.<br />I change my location about two times a week.</p>
<p>Computer, forest, batteries...? Unpractical? Maybe it would have been more rational to keep the apartment and just cut costs?<br />Well, rational and right do not always align.</p>
<p>I have no apartment, I have no job and I have no income.<br />Still I'm exactly where I should be. I'm on my path. My gut feeling lets me know that.</p>
<p>I'm not exiting to a normal life until my startup has taken off. This is my big adventure. I'm not coming back empty handed.</p>
<p>Small notes on how to do this:<br />    I power my laptop, phone and external battery with two portable Brunton 62 Watt solar panels.<br />    I cook nice food on my Primus OmniLite stove.<br />    I live in a comfortable Hilleberg tent.<br />    I carry all 35 kg in a Norrona Recon back pack.</p>
<p>There's my live, 35 kg. It should not take more to slay the dragon, win the kingdom and divorce the princess.<br />Well I do also have a car. C'mon, dragon slayer without a horse?</p>
<p>If you are in the startup business you know that raising capital is not easy.<br />I speak to some seeders. They love my idea. I mean everyone I speak to love it, but the seeders<br />say it's to early to invest in without having actually seen the product. Maybe they're right. Hard for me<br />to decide, I'm a bit biased.</p>
<p>I can't really tell you what I'm doing, but yesterday I read this in an article by Adam Wiggins:<br />"Software is eating the world. Everyone can and should be able to write software in order to have a stake in the future."<br />This is exactly what I'm doing. Bringing software development to the masses.</p>
<p>The lulz requires this, me and my designer Micael are looking for:<br />    Javascript/HTML/CSS haxx0rs with a sense of design.<br />    C++/Lua/GNU/Linux gurus.<br />    Investors in IT that want to break new ground.<br />Not that we could pay you any bucks, but the lulz are the lulz. =)</p>
<p>If you want to see some pictures of my forest life, try my blog, it's my fullname dot com.<br />Or follow me on Twitter, my Twitter id is also my full name.</p>
<p>Quitting my apartment and my job at the same time was really hard to do.<br />I had elevated adrenalin levels for days. To sooth the waves of anxiety that swept over me regularly, I had one picture<br />that I kept looking at. It was a picture of the beautiful forest which I was to move to. That gave me strength to<br />take the steps necessary to get on the trail.</p>
<p>I really hope you're on your path or taking calculated steps to get there. However big or small it may be.</p>
<p>Some kisses and some hugs and remember to stay true. But you already knew that.</p>

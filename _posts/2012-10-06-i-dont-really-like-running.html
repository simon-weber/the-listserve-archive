<p>I don't really like running.</p>
<p>I don' like to wake up early in the morning.<br />I could list a couple of more things that I don't like.</p>
<p>This is limiting. This is what I say to myself. It doesn't make my life easier or happier. Then why do I say them? I go running anyways. It's much more easier if I enjoy it...or at least tell myself (out loud) why it's good for me and why I like it. I like running because I'm in control not my body. Going for a run is good for my self-discipline, it also helps me to get out of my comfort zone. It's amazing how much power our mind (and through it our self-talk) has. Use it for you not against you. Just listen to what you say  - are you helping and supporting or exhausting yourself (and others).  You&#8217;re in charge to control what you say. If you don't like some qualities that you have, change them. Through changing self-talk and self-image you can become the person you have always wanted to be. It's not easy but completely doable. It just requires dedication and work.</p>

<p>P.S. Ask yourself what gets you excited? Do the things that get you excited. I get excited about (personal) growth, seeing others growing. This is happiness.</p>

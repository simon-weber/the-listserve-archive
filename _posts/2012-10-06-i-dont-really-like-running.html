      \ zone. It's amazing how much power our mind (and through it our self-talk)\
      \ has. Use it for you not against you. Just listen to what you say  - are you\
      \ helping and supporting or exhausting yourself (and others).  You\u2019re in\
      \ charge to control what you say. If you don't like some qualities that you\
      \ have, change them. Through changing self-talk and self-image you can become\
      \ the person you have always wanted to be. It's not easy but completely doable.\
      \ It just requires dedication and work.\r\n\r\n\r\nEpp\t\r\nTartu, Estonia\r\

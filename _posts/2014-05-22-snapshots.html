      \ not allow for motor vehicles. Instead visitors walk, ride bicycles or take\
      \ horse-drawn carriages to get wherever they\u2019d like to go. While the \u2018\
      downtown core\u2019 of the island is a total tourist trap, what\u2019s not as\
      \ well known about the island is that it includes a state park and with that,\
      \ a combination of paved, dirt and unkempt trails to be explored on bike or\
      \ foot. A number of times my husband and I have taken the trails and not seen\
      \ anyone else for several hours, which I think is amazing because of the thousands\
      \ of tourists that it attracts during the regular season. These trails are hidden\
      \ gems. Due to my lack of training for the bike ride\u2026 feel free to send\

      <p>A few snapshots from my life:</p>

      <p>Bikes:<br />I&#8217;m participating in the Zoo-de-Mack bike ride this Saturday,

      <p>Travelling:<br />In September 2012 my husband and I went to the Netherlands
      and Germany for our &#8216;honeymoon&#8217;. People at home and many of those
      encountered on the way told us we were crazy for spending what was supposed

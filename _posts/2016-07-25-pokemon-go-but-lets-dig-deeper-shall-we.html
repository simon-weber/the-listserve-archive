      <p>If you are, congratulations! Like me, you are a part of a revolution -- a
      revolution that has been consuming millennials for the past week or so. It''s
      burgeoning and staggering. But like every "viral" trend, either it will kill
      us or it will die out in a few weeks. Likely the latter. Quick poll: Who remembers

      <p>Recently, my roommates and I have been discussing the value of virtual reality

      from your Lazy-Boy! Creepy...right?</p>

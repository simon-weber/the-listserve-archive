      \ of dating. I, a daughter of traditional \"\"get married first\"\" parents\
      \ and my boyfriend decided to live in a van before continuing our studies. Our\
      \ reasoning meshed well, I couldn't justify incurring double my student loan\
      \ debt and I have a crazy dream of having a mobile law office. He the more environmental\
      \ type, was intrigued about living small, reducing our carbon footprint, learning\
      \ how to install solar panels and building out a van. \r\n\r\nI had never lived\
      \ with someone so closely, had never lived with a boyfriend, never enjoyed having\
      \ roommates, and moved far away from everything/everyone I knew. With so many\
      \ new things, I now see it sounds like a disaster or multiple disasters waiting\
      \ to happen.\r\n\r\nIt was rough for the first month or so as we would get into\
      \ arguments over little things such as not being able to study while the other\
      \ is watching something on their phone, not being able to sleep, being too cold,\
      \ not putting stuff away (which is a big deal in a small space). We have gotten\
      \ used to each other now, we can read each other's body language and know when\
      \ something is wrong. In the end we are much closer. We don't have an assortment\
      \ of 'stuff' we don't need and when we house sit it is like a mini vacation\
      \ for us!\r\n\r\nLiving in a van makes you very comfortable in public spaces.\
      \ I don't mind using public bathrooms or porta-potty's anymore. In fact, I have\
      \ a mental list of bathrooms that are open late. We shower at the gym and get\
      \ out more than we probably would if we lived in an apartment. Because of this,\
      \ the van life feels bigger than the space we actually have. We study at coffee\
      \ shops- feels just like a living room but bigger, sometimes our living room\
      \ has a fireplace! I eat in grocery store dining areas- just like a dining room\
      \ but with strangers! And I shower at the gym, which has endless soap, lotion,\
      \ toilet paper- better than my old bathroom and hey, no emergency toilet paper\
      \ runs!\r\n\r\nI do realize I am very privileged to be able to choose to live\
      \ this way while others do not have that option. I hope to one day help those\
      \ who don't have the financial means to access our justice system an opportunity\
      \ to do so. And I refuse to have to choose between paying my student loans and\
      \ helping those disenfranchised. I don't want to risk my dreams being held down\
      \ by debt.\r\n\r\nIn the end, our goal is to buy a plot of land, build a tiny\
      \ house, and of course have plenty of animals.\r\n\r\nMy unsolicited piece of\
      \ advice. I hope you say YES to those opportunities that come your way. I have\
      \ always been one to always say NO because of my fear of failing, or my dread\
      \ of new things and the nervousness that comes with that. I've not applied or\
      \ turned down to certain jobs because I felt I wasn't qualified, I've not taken\
      \ leaps to date someone because I feared rejection etc. A few years ago I started\
      \ to say yes to the things that I knew would make me feel that way and I couldn't\
      \ be happier. I have an amazing boyfriend (thanks to saying YES to being introduced\
      \ to him), loving parents that support me in my craziness even though I thought\
      \ I was disappointing them, and so many new experiences from jobs to vacations\
      \ to injuries etc.\r\n\r\nFinally if you are in the Washington Oregon border,\

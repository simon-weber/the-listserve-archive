<p>Hello out there.. My name is Jerry, and I&#8217;ve been on the internet since it was just a series of tubes. I teach a bit, (Computers and Programming) and enjoy technology the way you might think.</p>
<p>As an &#8220;Early Adopter&#8221;, I still have my Compaq &#8220;Luggable&#8221; that runs the CPM operating system. (Google it..)</p>
<p>I just returned from the Consumer Electronics Show, (C.E.S.) and was able to see many exciting new products, most priced above my pay grade. (Way above in some cases.)</p>
<p>That being said, I have found over the years that anything you want can be achieved if you focus on it.</p>
<p>So I guess my topic is, &#8220;Live Your Dreams, and They Will Come True&#8221;.</p>
<p>This email arrived by way of my &#8220;Spam Box&#8221; even though the regular Listserve emails arrive unscathed. I&#8217;m not a bitter guy, so I still responded to this &#8220;Winners&#8221; email even though it&#8217;s past the 48 hour window.</p>
<p>Best to you and yours.</p>

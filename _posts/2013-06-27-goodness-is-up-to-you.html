<p>Be kind. Everyone you meet is fighting a great battle, whether it is apparent or not.</p>
<p>And whenever you're feeling down, drink a big glass of water or bake some chocolate chip cookies.</p>
<p>Ingredients</p>
<p>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour<br />1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br />1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature<br />1/2 cup granulated sugar<br />1 cup packed light-brown sugar<br />1 teaspoon salt<br />2 teaspoons orange extract<br />1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br />2 large eggs<br />2 cups (about 12 ounces) semisweet and/or milk chocolate chips</p>
<p>Directions</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and baking soda; set aside. In a separate bowl with a wooden spoon, combine the butter with both sugars; mix until light and fluffy. Add the salt, orange, vanilla, and eggs. Mix thoroughly and then add flour mixture. Most importantly - stir in the chocolate chips!</p>
<p>Drop heaping tablespoon-size balls of dough about 2 inches apart on baking sheets lined with tin foil or parchment paper.</p>
<p>Bake until cookies are golden around the edges, but still soft in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven, and let cool on baking sheet 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack, and let cool completely.</p>

      <p>Even if there is, They always leave me with cruel choices They force me to
      make. I never had a choice.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve had my time thanking the Universe. I&#8217;ve also had time blaming
      it on the Cosmic Irony. I&#8217;ve been through anger and I&#8217;ve also been

      <p>Yesterday, it just occurred to me that I was wrong.</p>

      <p>Choices. Yes they have always been cruel. Of course They would never give
      us the easy way with choices.</p>

      <p>Free will. All this time, I&#8217;ve been closing my eyes and choosing to
      not see the big picture. It&#8217;s not about the choices or how cruel they
      are. It&#8217;s about the way you see them. That&#8217;s our free will. Choosing
      the way you see those cruel choices. It&#8217;s either you keep bargaining and

      <p>There&#8217;s nothing you can do about those choices. It has to be made.

      given to you for it helps you grow.</p>

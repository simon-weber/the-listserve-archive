      \ your email each day means so much to me. The best I\u2019ve come up with is\
      \ that back in the old days, before tweets and tags and status updates, we\u2019\
      d have had a lot more opportunities to strike up conversation with each other.\
      \ You know, face to face. You\u2019d have told me your yarn, I\u2019d have shared\
      \ mine.\r\n\r\nI feel like the Listserve is the closest we get to that now \u2013\
      \ an unmediated insight into each other\u2019s lives.\r\n\r\nKeep on sharing.\
      \ I like hearing you tell me your ideas and experiences, your adventures, victories\
      \ and defeats, your hopes and despairs, weaving our collective story.\r\n\r\n\
      The stories we tell ourselves are important. As individuals, as communities,\
      \ as societies. How and who we want to be matters. This weekend just gone, hundreds\
      \ of thousands of people around the world took to the streets to tell the story\
      \ of our ability to shape a better future. I took part in London. People from\
      \ all walks of life, marching together against climate change. I often feel\
      \ powerless reading the newspaper and watching the news. But walking together\
      \ with others, knowing there were multitudes of other people out there sharing\
      \ the same vision, made me feel powerful individually and to believe in our\
      \ power collectively.\r\n\r\nToo often we\u2019re taught that we have to accept\
      \ the world as it is. That the structures and systems of our society, our economy,\
      \ our politics are unchangeable.\r\n\r\nThis is not so. Apart from the laws\

      \ to reveal how much exactly they receive from BP (anything to do with an ex-CEO\
      \ of BP chair the Tate\u2019s Board of Trustees?) but every day the Tate scrubs\
      \ BP\u2019s public image clean, soiling the integrity of the arts for a negligible\

      what beautiful people you are.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about why it is that your email each day means so
      much to me. The best I&#8217;ve come up with is that back in the old days, before

      to strike up conversation with each other. You know, face to face. You&#8217;d
      have told me your yarn, I&#8217;d have shared mine.</p>

      <p>I feel like the Listserve is the closest we get to that now &#8211; an unmediated
      insight into each other&#8217;s lives.</p>

      <p>Keep on sharing. I like hearing you tell me your ideas and experiences, your
      adventures, victories and defeats, your hopes and despairs, weaving our collective
      story.</p>

      <p>The stories we tell ourselves are important. As individuals, as communities,
      as societies. How and who we want to be matters. This weekend just gone, hundreds
      of thousands of people around the world took to the streets to tell the story

      <p>On which note.</p>

      <p>Here where I live, in London, BP sponsor the Tate Gallery, one of the UK&#8217;s

      \ was admitted and given a diagnosis. My wife had bipolar disorder.\r\n\r\n\
      When we talk the months following her hospitalization, I realize we had completely\

      \ seeing or talking to friends and family, it became clear she was wandering\
      \ the streets of New York by herself.\r\n\r\nShe accused me of robbing her of\

      \ we had always valued our independence. In fact, we decided to go to colleges\

      \ I stole and hid her credit cards. After a month, she went to go stay with\

      \ condition. Sometimes it's just as if nothing happened; other times it feels\
      \ like the specter of bipolar disorder casts a pall over every conversation\
      \ and decision. I think about the violations of trust I committed to try to\

      <p>One of my dad&#8217;s favorite tales to tell is the first time I rode a rollercoaster.
      This love affair began when I was little and my family took a trip to Virginia.
      All day I had been asking to go on a rollercoaster. It intrigued me the way
      that they twirled in the air and screams of laughter rang from within. This
      was something I needed to try for myself, but I was just too short. Finally,
      we came across &#8220;The Big Bad Wolf&#8221;. The name sounds far more intimidating
      than it was, and after further inspection, this was the one. I was just barely
      tall enough if I stood on my tippy-toes. We made our ascent to the top, whooshing
      through the ride, spilling out with laughter and screaming. Then, the ride began
      to go up another hill that was twice as big as before. My eyes began to grow
      to the size of a silver dollar and I instantly doubted my love affair with rollercoasters.
      When we reached the summit I remember looking at my dad and saying &#8220;Holy
      $#*%!!!&#8221;. We raced down the remaining portion of the track and plummeted
      to the bottom. When the ride ended, my dad feared what I would say next, but
      all I said was, &#8220;let&#8217;s do that again!&#8221; And so began my love
      affair with rollercoasters.</p>

      <p>These were the happy days spent with my dad. Days full of abundant smiles,
      joy, and overwhelming peace. Recently, those bright days began to turn dark

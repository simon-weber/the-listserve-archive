      \ cancer 9 months ago. He sought treatment from well known oncologists and surgeons.\
      \ His prognosis was great.\r\n\r\nThe cancer was aggressive. It spread while\
      \ he was on chemo. The oncologist dismissed signs of its spread. I wanted to\
      \ ask questions about strange CT findings and challenge his dismissive statements,\
      \ but Dad comes from a culture where you respect and defer to the doctor. So\
      \ we didn't question his care. We trusted him. Our health care system is so\

      \ therapies were tried.\r\n\r\nMaybe dad would still be here if he was diagnosed\
      \ sooner, when he first went to the doctor complaining of abdominal pain and\
      \ fevers. Or the second time. Or the third time. (Before he finally quietly\
      \ asked, would it be possible to get a CT scan?).\r\n\r\nMaybe if none of these\
      \ things had happened, he still would have died at the same time on the same\
      \ day - 12:20 am on the first day of the year. \"There are many causes, but\
      \ there is one death.\"\r\n\r\nLife after experiencing death is so different.\
      \ I hope one day I will be able to experience joy again, see colors as bright\
      \ as they used to be, laugh as hard as I once did. God's ways are higher than\
      \ our ways. I have so many questions about His timing, but as a piece of clay\
      \ cannot second guess the potter in his work, so, too, am I.\r\n\r\n\u201CThen\
      \ I went down to the potter\u2019s house, and there he was, making something\

    body: "I want to begin with an apology.  A few years ago I won this honor of posting\
      \ some thoughts on this List.  At the end, I stated that since I\u2019d been\
      \ a therapist for almost forty years I had seen and heard almost everything,\
      \ and now, as I aged, I had all the answers.  I told anyone and everyone to\
      \ send me any questions about life, love or their psychological state, and I\
      \ would answer them.\r\n\r\nWithin a week I had received almost six hundred\
      \ questions.  Some of them were kind of fun, but many of them were serious,\
      \ involving family, relationships, money, education, and even depression and\
      \ abuse.\r\n\r\nI answered about fifty of them during the next six weeks and\
      \ realized I was less than 10% there. For those of you, if your still on the\
      \ List, who either got some brief letter or no response at all, I sincerely\
      \ apologized.\r\n\r\nNo questions this time.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem in responding\
      \ is that life is complex, so to give any kind of helpful answer to people I\
      \ don\u2019t know took a lot of explaining - if this then this, but if not this,\
      \ than that.  And even that wouldn\u2019t cover it.\r\n\r\nSo this time, I will\
      \ give one answer that fits all and any questions.\r\n\r\nIf your life is difficult,\
      \ as all lives are, some more than others, and you want to make a significant\
      \ change, there are many things you need to consider.  You have to realize that\
      \ it will take a lot of planning and a lot of practice.\r\n\r\nProbably 92%\
      \ ( a number I just decided upon) of everything we do is determined by four\
      \ major forces that are constantly interacting.  The first is your genetics.\
      \  That gives you some talents, and all of your characteristics.  Genetics determine\
      \ if you are tall, fat, good looking, or can run fast, can\u2019t see well,\
      \ or are dyslexic.  These things  will affect your life.  It won\u2019t totally\
      \ rule it, but it will make a difference.\r\n\r\nThen your genetic self will\
      \ be shaped and molded by the family you live in.  That family can take many\
      \ shapes or forms, especially these days.  It could be you live in the Clever\
      \ family, or the Brady Bunch, or maybe just with your grandmother, but you will\
      \ be given a very strong impression of how the world works, and what your place\
      \ is in the world, by what happens with that group, in those early years.\r\n\
      \r\nNext, with those genes and the beliefs and behaviors you learned from your\
      \ family, you will go out into the larger world.  Your community will bounce\
      \ behaviors and ideas off of you.  Some you will accept, others you will pull\
      \ away from, depending upon your genetics and your family.\r\nBut, look at this\
      \ last U.S. election.  Most people voted the way the others in their community\
      \ voted. Peer pressure? Living in a bubble?  Fear of rejection?  A mind shaped\
      \ by the local truth?\r\nYes to all of those.\r\n\r\nThose are the three major\
      \ forces that determine almost everything we think, feel and act.  But, all\
      \ of that can be altered if your health goes badly.  If you get in an accident,\
      \ or have a major illness, or absorb too many chemicals, or eat a terrible diet,\
      \ you life will be changed. You will think and act differently.\r\n\r\nThese\
      \ forces are affecting you all of your life.  These forces resist change.  They\
      \ limit your options.  That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing.  But we all\
      \ have to realize who we are, where we are, and what\u2019s going on.  If you\
      \ want to change the way you think, act and feel, you have to recognize the\
      \ forces that made you the way you are.  Then you have to find ways to build\
      \ new habits and practice those behaviors.  You have to be prepared for people\
      \ to treat you differently, because you will be disrupting their lives too.\r\
      \n\r\nOr, hopefully, you can enjoy who you are, what you\u2019ve become and\
      \ whom you are with. Making small adjustments, like getting up earlier, can\
      \ be easily accomplished.\r\n\r\nAnyway.  the solstice has just passed, and\
      \ we will be getting our light back; more each day. That is worth celebrating!!\r\

      <p>No questions this time.</p>

      cover it.</p>

      <p>So this time, I will give one answer that fits all and any questions.</p>

      <p>If your life is difficult, as all lives are, some more than others, and you
      want to make a significant change, there are many things you need to consider.  You
      have to realize that it will take a lot of planning and a lot of practice.</p>

      <p>Probably 92% ( a number I just decided upon) of everything we do is determined
      by four major forces that are constantly interacting.  The first is your genetics.  That
      gives you some talents, and all of your characteristics.  Genetics determine
      if you are tall, fat, good looking, or can run fast, can&#8217;t see well, or
      are dyslexic.  These things  will affect your life.  It won&#8217;t totally
      rule it, but it will make a difference.</p>

      <p>Then your genetic self will be shaped and molded by the family you live in.  That
      family can take many shapes or forms, especially these days.  It could be you
      live in the Clever family, or the Brady Bunch, or maybe just with your grandmother,
      but you will be given a very strong impression of how the world works, and what
      your place is in the world, by what happens with that group, in those early
      years.</p>

      <p>Next, with those genes and the beliefs and behaviors you learned from your
      family, you will go out into the larger world.  Your community will bounce behaviors
      and ideas off of you.  Some you will accept, others you will pull away from,
      depending upon your genetics and your family.<br />But, look at this last U.S.
      election.  Most people voted the way the others in their community voted. Peer
      pressure? Living in a bubble?  Fear of rejection?  A mind shaped by the local

      <p>These forces are affecting you all of your life.  These forces resist change.  They

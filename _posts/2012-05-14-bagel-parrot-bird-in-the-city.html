      <p>- So, why "Bagel"? On a chilly Saturday morning in late December 2011, my
      boyfriend and I were at a loss for lunch options, per usual. We were headed
      east to the F train when we turned around because I decided I wanted a bagel
      from Brooklyn Bagels. One thing led to another, and we found ourselves at our
      local Petland Discounts playing with a beautiful baby African Grey*. It was
      only appropriate that we name our New York-born-and-bred bird after our prized
      breakfast staple. </p>

      <p>- Does she talk? Most definitely. She came home knowing how to say, "hello",
      "oh boy!", and "I love you", and mimicking a smoke-detector and aquarium bubbler.
      Since coming home, she''s only picked up gibberish, curiously enough, including
      "wee goo" and "bagel poopah"; she has also learned to mimic coughing and a door
      squeak. The other day, she said some indecipherable things in a deep masculine
      voice; I think she picked it up from PBS, which I leave on when I go to work.    </p>

      <p>- Does she get to go outside? Yes. She''s been outside a total of ~8 times,

      Fort Greene. She''s still learning how to fly, but we do have a parrot harness
      ready for when she grows out her flight feathers. </p>

      <p>- Where can you find Bagel? On my shoulder around Chelsea. Or, on Facebook,

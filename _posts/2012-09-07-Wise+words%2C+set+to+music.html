<p>Whenever it comes to finding the right words for a situation (such as now), I often find myself unable to say something clear enough, powerful enough, or smart enough. Luckily, I can always find a songwriter who can do it for me. When I need words of hope or wisdom, or when I need to feel like someone else has felt the same pain and frustration as me, I look for it in song. It seems that here&#8217;s always someone who can speak my heart and mind better than I can. Sometimes I need a bit of energy, motivation, a good laugh, or just some entertainment. I find it all in music.</p>
<p>Look up these writers; I know they&#8217;ll give you something that speaks to you. You know how & where to find them. Their songs have done so much for me; the least I can do for them (and for you) is to hope that someone will discover them and enjoy their work, as I have. In no particular order:</p>
<p>Del Barber<br />Christina Martin<br />Leeroy Stagger<br />John K Samson/The Weakerthans<br />Jim Bryson<br />Willie P Bennett<br />Townes Van Zandt<br />Paul Kelly<br />David Francey<br />Matthew Ryan<br />Ron Hawkins/The Lowest of the Low<br />The Warped 45s<br />The Blue Shadows<br />Lynn Miles<br />NQ Arbuckle<br />Shannon Lyon<br />Rose Cousins<br />Oh Susanna<br />The Damnwells</p>
<p>These are just a few. Without these writers, I might not be alive today. I certainly wouldn&#8217;t be able to get by as well as I do. Let them move you.</p>

      <p>First thing, you''re getting this just around my 32nd birthday (10 Sept).
      I''ve never really liked my birthday and I''m sick of feeling miserable every
      time this day comes around. As a child my birthday was so close to the start
      of school that it often was forgotten by all my friends in the hubbub. As an
      adult my birthday has been over shadowed first from year after year of memorial
      reporting about the 9/11 terrorist attacks, than as my grandfather passed away
      right as I should have been celebrating 30. Help me reclaim my birthday, please!</p>

      <p>Second, I''m about to graduate with my MBA with a marketing concentration
      and am now looking to change my career path with my new degree. I''d like to
      break into marketing research or data analysis, but am finding that even with
      the MBA, everyone wants related work experience, even for entry level jobs.
      Any tips would be much appreciated!</p>

      <p>Thank you all for reading and thank you all for posting. Now that I''ve spent
      time looking at the e-mail saying I''m selected, I understand how hard this
      is.</p>

      <p>In conclusion, please remember that you are loved. Sometimes I forget, but
      I hope you don''t.</p>

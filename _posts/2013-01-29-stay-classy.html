    <p>I''m not going to give any sage advice here. Let''s get to know each other
    before we start dispensing recommendations on how to live life.</p>

    <p>So let me introduce myself. I''m a 35-year old real estate broker and entrepreneur
    living in New York City. I love it here. Sometimes life here is a bit too fast-paced,
    but overall, everything is within reach so it&#8217;s worth it. If you come visit
    (or if you already live here), feel free to reach out to meet, ask questions,
    or get a recommendation on where to eat. NYC has amazing food options everywhere.
    Let&#8217;s grab a bite!</p>

    <p>Some of my interests include: cooking, photography, kung fu (I practice at
    a school called Bo Law Kung Fu), the stock market, real estate, startups, technology,
    travel, and meeting interesting people. Oh, and chocolate chip cookies!</p>

    <p>I''ve always played things on the safe side. But no longer. I am currently
    planning to open a restaurant. Crazy, right? One of my passions has always been
    food. I love eating it. I love cooking it. I even love photographing it. Yes,
    I''m into foodporn. We have developed a sandwich shop concept and pretty soon
    we''re going to start raising money for this endeavor. Very exciting!</p>

    <p>So if you think I can help you or if you think you can help me, or if you just
    want to have a random conversation, just get in touch. I have met some amazing
    people on Twitter and I see no reason why I can&#8217;t do the same here. I love
    that Twitter and now The Listserve are both giving me the opportunity to interact
    with people from all over the world, from many different walks of life. We can

      I\u2019ve decided to talk about the two things most important to me (which also\
      \ happen to be the two most criticized things about me): witchcraft and feminism.\r\
      \n\r\nnow im almost 100% certain that my use of the terms 'witchcraft' and 'feminism'\
      \ alone has scared a few people off, but for those of you who remain, thank\
      \ you. im not here to preach to you all; im just here to share some stuff &\
      \ make some people more aware of the issues that the vast majority of society\
      \  likes to pretend don\u2019t exist.\r\n\r\nsadly, feminists have such a bad\
      \ rep. Here is how this conversation usually goes:\r\nme- are you a feminist?\r\
      \nperson- oh god no never absolutely not\r\nme-well, do you believe women and\
      \ men should be equal?\r\nperson- well, of course\r\n my friends, if you believe\
      \ women and men should have equal rights, you are a feminist. Many feel as though\
      \ women have already achieved full equality, and while we have achieved a lot...\
      \ We still have a long way to go.\r\n\r\nHere are few terms that are a little\
      \ too ingrained in our society: man up, don\u2019t be a pussy, grow a pair,\
      \ you throw like a girl, boys will be boys, the list goes on and on. you get\
      \ the picture.\r\n\r\nCan you all do me a favor? Erase the words 'slut' from\
      \ your vocabulary. It is a term invented to shame a woman for being comfortable\
      \ with her sexuality. God forbid, right?\r\n\r\nrape culture. rape culture.\
      \ rape culture. my best friend, Keagan (what you mras would probably call a\

      \ \u201Cwhy not call yourself a humanist, rather than a feminist?\u201D (I suppose\
      \ to avoid negative connotation). the history of witches and feminists, what\

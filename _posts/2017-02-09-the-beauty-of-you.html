      , I\u2019ve resorted to only the occasional recognition of where I am in my\
      \ self-improvement journey. My greatest personal struggle has been spreading\
      \ myself too thin as that doesn\u2019t allow me to share the best version of\
      \ myself with the world, which is a shame to do no matter who you are. So I\
      \ am choosing to not continue living life this way moving forward. The universe\

      \ education on this, I would appreciate any information you have to share, particularly\
      \ the highs, lows, and reality of your day-to-day life on said path. I live\

      \ If you\u2019ve never knit, think about giving it a shot \u2013 it\u2019s easier\
      \ than you may think, wayyy more fun and addicting than you may think, produces\
      \ effects in the brain similar to meditation, results in useful items (caps\
      \ for cancer victims, sweaters for animals affected by oil spills), and is just\
      \ awesome all around.\r\n\r\nFor those who enjoy or appreciate photography,\

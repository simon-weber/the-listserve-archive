      \ You would totally eliminate poverty, but you would likely crash the economy--there\
      \ are still plenty of low-wage jobs out there which can\u2019t yet be done by\

      \ If people knew they wouldn\u2019t starve even if they just lazed in their\

      \ raise the price of fruit etc. dramatically.\r\n\r\nStill, it\u2019s a beautiful\
      \ dream, and in an increasingly automated world, it\u2019s one to keep an eye\
      \ on. The promise is not simply to completely eliminate poverty, but to significantly\
      \ increase wage equality. Some jobs are simply fun to do; there are people passionate\
      \ about teaching, programming, engineering, and many other fields. Those positions\
      \ won\u2019t suffer under UBI. However, very few people have a true passion\
      \ for being the graveyard shift clerk in a 24-hour gas station on the highway.\
      \ Those sort of positions will simply have to automate, or pay more in order\

      \ too early is a huge financial risk. Do we just cast the affected individuals\
      \ to the wind? I\u2019d hope not. I\u2019d dearly love to see a UBI worked out\
      \ within my lifetime. What it really comes down to is what you want for your\

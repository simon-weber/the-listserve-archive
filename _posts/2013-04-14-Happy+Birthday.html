<p>Blake,</p>
<p>Even with this weird opportunity to send a message to 21,422 people, I&#8217;d rather just send you a birthday note. So, listen up:</p>
<p>You are f$%&ing awesome.</p>
<p>I know it&#8217;s been a pretty weird (weird = kind of crappy and also legitimately weird) year for you, but you&#8217;re less than a week away from a fresh start.</p>
<p>Last year you:</p>
<p>Took a paid sabbatical.<br />Tried stand up comedy.<br />Realized stand up comedy was not your jam and tried writing funny stuff instead.<br />Wrote funny stuff.<br />Helped a lot of vets.<br />Stopped being a vegan.<br />Became one of my best friends.</p>
<p>This year you will:</p>
<p>Realize that you are f$%&ing awesome.<br />Try improv comedy.<br />Tell someone exactly why he or she should hire you and believe it.<br />Tell your dumb boss exactly what you think (at least once).<br />Teach someone else how to be a great friend who does things like sending text messages at 8:25 AM on Monday mornings that say &#8220;Here&#8217;s to a good week!&#8221; even though you know it won&#8217;t be.<br />Re-read Fierce Invalids and learn something new about Switters.</p>
<p>I know you will.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with improv - first class on Daniel and me. We&#8217;re signing you up for Level One with Armando on April 27th. Happy Birthday!</p>
<p>Cheers to you, your big heart, your ridiculous giggle, your brave and lonely feminism, and your eerie way of knowing what&#8217;s right - always.</p>
<p>With my heart,</p>

<p>p.s. Sorry about that Oxford comma, I always get confused when there are so many "and-s" around.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a 17 year old guy from Toronto and last year I started a food blog called IronWhisk. In retrospect, I&#8217;m not entirely sure why I chose to name it IronWhisk since, well, iron rusts. Iron would not be a particularly great material to make a whisk out of.</p>
<p>I invite you to follow along as I tackle some pretty challenging pastry and dessert recipes. Some pretty crazy ones too, such as a cake that I made that looked like a bushel of bamboo. Particularly exciting are the Japanese recipes that I cannot read, but decide to do anyway just for kicks.</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;m curious if there are any other food bloggers that subscribe to The Listserve. Be sure to say hello if you&#8217;re out there! Please send foodstuffs.</p>
<p>P.S. My website isn&#8217;t showing up correctly on Internet Explorer, specifically on smaller screens (the right sidebar is pushed down to the bottom of the page). If anyone would like to help me fix the problem it would be much appreciated.</p>

    body: "Nearly 3,000 people died on 9/11.\r\n\r\nYet according to wikipedia between\
      \ 250 and 1,000 people in the US die each year from erotic asphyxiation.\r\n\
      \r\nSo in the 15 years since 9/11 - between 3,750 and 15,000 people have died\
      \ from that.\r\n\r\nThe US government may as well spend hundreds of billions\
      \ of dollars encouraging people to jerk off more safely.\r\nTerrorism is shocking\
      \ and tragic. But it always surprises me that so much money is spent on it when\
      \ it is such a rare way for people to die. Particularly when it is pretty much\
      \ impossible to prevent in any case.\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\n\
      There are now thirteen times as many suicides as murders in the UK.\r\n\r\n\
      When walking home late at night the footsteps you should be afraid of, statistically,\

      \n\r\nI have studied magic my whole life. The best thinker in magic today is\

      \n\r\nWanna' see a trick?\r\n\r\n\"This is a mystical trick that I learnt in\
      \ Australia \u2013 the continent \u2018down under\u2019\u2026\"\r\n\r\nGo grab\
      \ a deck of cards \u2013 it doesn\u2019t need to be complete.\r\n\r\nShuffle\
      \ the deck and freely divide it into 4 packets ie cut the deck into 4 piles.\r\
      \n\r\nPick up any packet and shuffle it. Look at the top card and remember it.\r\
      \n\r\nNow spell \u201CAustralian Shuffle\u201D \u2013 transferring one card\
      \ from top to bottom for each letter. This helps lose the card in the packet.\r\
      \n\r\nOnce you have done that. We will now use the mysterious \u2018Australian\
      \ Shuffle\u2019 to find your card.\r\n\r\nFirst \u2013 I should explain what\
      \ an \u2018Australian\u2019 Shuffle is \u2013 it is a DOWN/UNDER deal. So place\
      \ the top card down on the table, and the next card under the packet \u2013\
      \ and so on\u2026\r\n\r\nDo this until you have one card remaining in your hand.\r\
      \n\r\nIt is your selected card!\r\n\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nWe\
      \ can use magic to entertain people. Or to scam them.\r\n\r\n--------------------------\r\
      \n\r\nTake a deck of cards and place them in red/black order:\r\n\r\nRED/BLACK/RED/BLACK\u2026\
      \ etc.\r\n\r\nYou then take the top card (a RED card) and insert the card anywhere\
      \ into the deck. A nice way of doing this is to spread the cards face-down on\
      \ the table and have the spectator insert the FACE UP red card anywhere they\
      \ want.\r\n\r\nYou then tell the spectator you will deal off a pair of cards\
      \ at a time. If the FACE UP red card in the pair is with another red card. He\
      \ wins. If it is with a black card \u2013 you win. Thanks to The Gilbreath Principle\
      \ you will always win.\r\n\r\nFree money! Yeah!!!\r\n\r\n---------------------------\r\
      \n\r\nRelativity is not really about time. It is about what do we mean by the\
      \ word \"Now\"?\r\n\r\nThere is no single thing called \"Now\" that applies\
      \ to the whole universe. Instead there are an infinite number of \"Nows\" depending\
      \ on where you are in the universe. Two events only share the same \"Now\" if\
      \ they occur in the same place at the same time.\r\n\r\nFor centuries, philosophers\
      \ thought about time. And in doing so they smuggled in the assumption that inherent\
      \ to the concept of time is that simultaneous events will be the same for all\
      \ observers. Indeed this was such a buried assumption \u2013 that no philosopher\
      \ even bothered to note it when analyzing the concept of time.\r\n\r\nThen Einstein\
      \ came along \u2013 teased out this assumption and the rest is history. To me\
      \ - Einstein was a philosopher more than he was a physicist.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\

      <p>Wanna'' see a trick?</p>

      <p>"This is a mystical trick that I learnt in Australia &#8211; the continent

      <p>Go grab a deck of cards &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t need to be complete.</p>

      <p>Shuffle the deck and freely divide it into 4 packets ie cut the deck into

      <p>Pick up any packet and shuffle it. Look at the top card and remember it.</p>

      <p>Now spell &#8220;Australian Shuffle&#8221; &#8211; transferring one card

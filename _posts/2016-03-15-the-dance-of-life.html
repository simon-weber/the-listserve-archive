      \ out of slumber. As for myself, I would say as much that my entry was more\
      \ of an offbeat glissade (Sorry mom). The first stage shone, Fahaheel, Kuwait\
      \ City, a small Arab country on the Persian Gulf. My dance as a toddler began\
      \ as a petite chass\xE9, which lasted until early 2001. Despite my current age\
      \ (19), I have some cherished memories of the days spent on that sandy and oh\
      \ so dusty stage. Now, my parents at the time were hard workers, they would\
      \ spend long hours trying to provide for two growing infants, myself and my\
      \ older brother. This resulted in days spent with our nanny, and the occasional\
      \ fox trot with our neighboring childhood friend. Dust storms were infrequent,\
      \ but would make a slow coup\xE9, engulfing the small Arabian city. The three\
      \ of us would take refuge in our tiny and compact apartment complex, somewhere\
      \ between the 4th or 7th floor. As the dust storm settles with its final pas,\
      \ I would always be in awe when small patches of dust/sand lay on the floor,\
      \ blending with the fractal designs of the carpeting. Such nostalgic memories\
      \ are those I wish would never \xE9chapp\xE9 from my mind.\r\n\r\nAs the early\
      \ 2001\u2019s approached, the adagio of my parent\u2019s efforts brought my\
      \ brother and me to a cold and distant stage known as Winnipeg, Manitoba. This\
      \ decently sized Canadian city became a new haven for my family, a clean slate\
      \ you could say. Transitioning into this new land was not an easy endeavor to\
      \ say the least. It was an allegro of planning and consulting, but gladly there\
      \ were warm and welcoming hearts. For quite some time my family took vacancy\
      \ with some relatives, the four of us jam packed into a small bedroom upstairs\
      \ in their humble abode. My parents took another dive, from a sudden bris\xE9\
      \ to a soft elev\xE9, working two jobs was necessary in order to further support\
      \ the family. They continued their graceful pirouette on a slippery and foreign\
      \ dance floor, until a sanctuary of our own was obtainable. A dance floor just\
      \ for the four of us, we took vacancy in a small, comfy ranch style home, located\
      \ somewhere in Northwest Winnipeg. My brother and I were thankful for our parent\u2019\
      s efforts. A large portion of our youth was then spent in a wild swing, playing\
      \ with the neighborhood kids until sun down. The time spent in this distant\
      \ land slowly became not too far out of reach and we began to warm up to its\
      \ unfamiliar touch. Great friends and memories were created.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,\
      \ the joy was short lived and the grand battement of life has swung our family\
      \ into yet another waltz. In the early years of 2004, our family moved yet again,\
      \ to our third and final stop, Red Deer, Alberta. Again, we took vacancy in\
      \ a ranch style home, with some friendly strangers renting the basement below\
      \ us. My brother and I felt as if a part of ourselves were left behind, but\
      \ we knew it was for the best.\r\n\r\nDespite all that, my parents never once\

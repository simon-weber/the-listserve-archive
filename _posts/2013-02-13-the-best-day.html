      \r\nFirst, I'd like to say that I am 39 years old. Really. I am not the most\

      \n\r\nI am what most in the U.S. consider a 'red neck'. My husband works in\
      \ the oilfield. He comes home dirty. I hope that his job is limited as we move\
      \ towards other energy sources. I work as an office manager of a small newspaper\
      \ that is devoted to ads. It is a limited job due to the Internet. Most people\
      \ assume we are small minded bigots, in a backward rural community. Those people\
      \ would be wrong. I have found that deep down all people want the same things,\
      \ no matter what color, nationality, religion, or upbringing. Some people are\
      \ more aggressive about getting what they want. Some are happy with less. Some\
      \ stumble around not knowing what they want, or how to get it. It is usually\
      \ the people who don't know what they want that cause problems for the rest\
      \ of us. They think if they get 'a little bit more' they will be happy, and\
      \ since they can never get what they think they want; they try to take others\
      \ happiness. I avoid those folks now. I look for the people who are already\
      \ happy, because they want to share their joy with others.\r\n\r\nOne thing\
      \ I have always wanted was a Ford Mustang. I didn't need it to be happy. I am\
      \ very happy with my life now. I have a great family and all our needs and many\
      \ wants are met. We face set backs and an occasional attack from hateful people,\
      \ but we are doing well. I still never lost my desire for a Mustang, though.\
      \ Today I found out that my husband has bought me my dream car. It will be here\
      \ tomorrow. I'm glad I did not get it sooner, because I would have mistaken\
      \ it for part of my happiness. It is not, it just adds a little bit to it.\r\
      \n\r\nBTW, feel free to write me! I love \"talking\" to people no matter who\
      \ they are.\r\n\r\n\r\nJennifer Adkisson \t\r\njenn_adkisson@yahoo.com\t\r\n\

      \ that you don't have to now. Excuse all those stupid things they said which\

      \ about holding grudges.\r\n\r\nGrudges are what happen when you let someone\
      \ irrationally occupy your thoughts and and affect your actions because of some\
      \ wrong they did to you. This includes the places you can't go, the people you\
      \ can't speak to, the conversation topics that can't take place without their\
      \ name coming up and making you upset. That all sounds like a lot of effort\
      \ for little gain, and it's just not worth it. Most grievances are based on\
      \ accidents or misunderstandings that got out of hand.\r\n\r\nIt's not easy,\
      \ and I struggle with it as I'm sure many of you do. I think that trying to\
      \ see the situation from someone else's position really helps. This, too, is\
      \ hard. I recently read some advice: To better understand the argument of your\
      \ opponent, try arguing their side of the story.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThose are\
      \ a couple of things I have been thinking about recently: learning and forgiveness.\
      \ I tend to overthink a lot of things, but being able to empathise is a skill\

      \ you've read this far, thanks, and I hope that I've made you think a little\

      \ in five years time I'll be all *for* grudges!\r\n\r\nNow onto the self-promotion\
      \ part of my email. I'm an Independent Software Developer, and I recently left\

      Finally, shoutouts. Jon and Alun: put your hand where your foot is. Happy 30th,\

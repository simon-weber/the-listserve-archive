      <p>Growing up moving around, I was constantly the new kid, constantly trying
      to fit in. I would do anything to feel like I belonged. Once I finally did,
      we would move again and I&#8217;d have to start over. It seemed like an endless,
      hopeless cycle.</p>

      <p>That being said please don&#8217;t get me wrong. So far, I&#8217;ve had an
      amazing, privileged life that I am incredibly thankful for. I just want to be
      able to answer the question, &#8220;if you could describe yourself in five words,
      what would they be?&#8221;</p>

      <p>For those of you that know who you are, know who you want to be, know where
      you want to go, please share your story. Tell me what your five words are.</p>

      <p>I can&#8217;t wait to hear from all of you.</p>

      <p>As my grandma would say:</p>

      <p>Floods of love.</p>

<p>I received the Listserve selection email the day I passed my test to become citizen of the U.S. I thought that&#8217;d give me something to write about, but then I found myself sitting in front of a blank word document. Nothing. Which isn&#8217;t to say I have nothing to express, but rather that I&#8217;m not quite sure how.</p>
<p>This happens more often than it should. I&#8217;m a college senior studying film and journalism; in essence, I&#8217;m building myself up for a career of words, yet I often struggle to use them.</p>
<p>So instead, I&#8217;d like to share some (rather random) words from others. Often when you don&#8217;t know what to say, someone already has:</p>
<p>&#8220;We can have in life but one great experience at best, and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible.&#8221; &#8212; Oscar Wilde</p>
<p><br />Maude: The earth is my body; my head is in the stars.</p>
<p>[pause]</p>
<p>Maude: Who said that, Harold?</p>
<p>Harold: I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Maude: Well, I suppose I did, then.</p>
<p>&#8212; Maude, Harold and Maude</p>
<p><br />&#8220;My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained.&#8221; &#8212; The Little Prince</p>
<p><br />The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. "Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?" he asked. "Begin at the beginning," the King said gravely, "and go on till you come to the end: then stop." &#8212; Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</p>
<p><br />&#8220;All writers are vain, selfish, and lazy, and at the very bottom of their motives there lies a mystery. Writing a book is a horrible, exhausting struggle, like a long bout of some painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand.&#8221; &#8212; George Orwell</p>
<p><br />If you write (journalism, screenwriting, or otherwise), please feel free to send me tips, advice, stories you've written. I&#8217;d love to read them.</p>

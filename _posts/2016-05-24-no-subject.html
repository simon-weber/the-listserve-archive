    body: '<p>Hello Listservees!</p>

      <p>This is my (lucky!) second time writing to everyone on The Listserve so I
      thought I''d share the spotlight a little. I''m a high school Art and Art History
      teacher and I asked students in a couple of my classes what they would like
      to say to the group.  A few students decided to share briefly what was on their
      mind at 7:45 in the morning but first a word or two about what I care about...</p>

      <p>I have been teaching art for nearly 20 years and over the last 12 years I
      have cultivated an art studio class that gives as much (more, really) weight
      to the process of learning and making art than the physical act or end artifact
      itself. The class is mixed grades, and considered an elevated (honors) course.
      Mostly because the students are expected to be intrinsically motivated and we
      shouldn''t be wasting time with behavioral stuff. More important for us to build
      a culture of rapport and support, to push each other to try new things, and
      to reflect on our process and what we have learned. In those years I have worked
      with amazing students who develop a point of view that they carry into the world
      through study, artmaking, social action and more. I am so amazed at their energy
      and what they do. And the magic for me is seeing them grow in front of me -
      become themselves - in our class.</p>

      <p>So,  back to their thoughts:</p>

      <p>We are all just things in a great big thing of things.</p>

      <p>Help I''m trapped in the email company</p>

      <p>god is god<br />and i am not<br />control what you can<br />let go of what
      you cannot</p>

      <p>be inimitable.</p>

      <p>When asked what to talk about I always hit a wall.</p>

      <p>pray for the things you want, work for the things you need</p>

      <p>It''s nice to be important, but it''s more important to be nice.</p>

      <p><br />I just shared exactly as they sent them to me, no editing. I think
      it typifies how they see themselves: trying out philosophy, thinking on their
      place in the world. What I wish I could show you are their artworks, the things
      they make when they stake a claim and pursue a concept artistically. Film, animation,
      stencil work, music video, graphic design, drawing and more. Every year I get
      my rosters and am met with enthusiasm, brightness, joy.</p>

      <p>So here is a salutation to all the students past and present, all of you
      thinking about becoming students again, those of you that teach, or those of
      you with children that are students...celebrate the students and teachers that
      bring joy, creativity and enthusiasm; share yourself, strive for an awesome
      inclusive and idea driven community.</p>

<p>I have never been very good at telling stories: I fumble, I slur words, I backtrack. But here I am, winning the chance to write an email to the world, so here is my story:I am living on five dollars a day for reweave (google it!).</p>
<p>It all started as a way to fundraise. Donate $1,000 and I&#8217;ll live on five dollars a day for a month.</p>
<p>What does it mean, exactly? There is no right or wrong way to do this experiment, but I set up rules so I could stay on track. This challenge goes beyond food; transportation, entertainment, and even a new toothbrush are being taken into account.</p>
<p>The rules are as follows:</p>
<p>I will not go into "debt" with friends (ie. having them pay for something and then I pay them back on October 1st).<br />If I accept something for free it either needs to be donated by an organization, offered for free to everyone, or it needs to be something I would have received for free even prior to this experiment.<br />Rent is not being included in this experiment because that would negatively affect my roommates, and that would be kind of scummy of me.</p>
<p>I know my monthly t-pass was $43 and I use the MBTA at least twice a day, five times a week. There are 20 workdays in September (excludes Labor day), so I pay approximately one dollar per bus/t ride. That leaves me with about $3 for food for the rest of the day. (If I walk home from work then I have $4.00!)</p>
<p>Food is a bit trickier. Eating at a restaurant has been of the question.<br />I've been saving my receipts and found that if I "charge" myself per serving, I can keep track of how much I spend and how much I eat.</p>
<p>For example: If I buy a container of oatmeal for $4.99 and there are 15 cups, I know that each 1/2 cup serving costs me 19 cents - that&#8217;s how much I will "charge" myself for breakfast.</p>
<p><br />My usually breakfast is oatmeal. Lunch = good ol&#8217; PB&amp;J. Dinner = Eggs and frozen veggies, sometimes pasta if I&#8217;m feeling adventurous (and by that I mean its harder to measure). I&#8217;ll throw a banana or a glass of milk in the mix for added nutrients.</p>
<p>At first glance it seems I am eating a well-rounded diet, however my body is already feeling the effects of transitioning from an organic diet to &#8220;the cheap stuff&#8221;. Also, the average person eats two or three times the recommended serving size, meaning that I am getting sufficiently less vegetable and fruit servings by measuring it out than by eating until I am full.</p>
<p>I have been seeing the effects in my sleep, my skin, my hair, and especially my weight. I have been keeping track of my caloric intake to ensure than I am eating a healthy amount, but eating more than 1,600 calories is a struggle.</p>
<p>People are not meant to live and eat on $5 a day. I repeat: human beings are NOT meant to live and eat on $5 a day. Think of the people who are forced to live on less.</p>
<p>Am I happy I am doing this experiment? Yes, and honestly, I would recommend that everyone do it for even just a week. It makes me think about the value of a dollar, the value of a serving, and the value of a meal.</p>
<p>What would you do with five dollars?</p>

    body: "I've no interest in impressing or enlightening anybody.  Which is odd 'cos\
      \ I write for a living, and I may be quitting my dayjob in a few months, I should\
      \ probably use this opportunity to promote my freelance services. Meh, I have\
      \ a wife and kids and a mortgage, we're doing fine, I don't need marketing.\r\
      \n\r\nAs a Listserve member, I never wanted to win, but if I did, I'd say, \"\
      I have nothing to say\" and then sign off.  But someone did that a year ago.\
      \  He or she took my only good idea.\r\n\r\nSo my wife persuaded me to rerun\
      \ a blog I wrote years ago.  \"What good is a baby?\"  It's longer than 600\
      \ words but I don't have time to make it shorter.  Google a representative phrase\
      \ if you want to read the whole thing, this will probably just get cut short\
      \ -\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe title\
      \ is a quote from the brilliant and influential 19th-century British scientist\
      \ Michael Faraday, who after showing the Prime Minister around his lab, was\
      \ asked - \"This is all very good, Mr. Faraday... but what possible use is it?\"\
      \r\n\r\n\"Mr. Prime Minister, what good is a baby?\" said the man whose work\
      \ would contribute to, among many other things: the development of electric\
      \ motors and generators, electrolysis, radio research, and even early insights\
      \ into nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nIt's actually a fair question to ask of science\
      \ - what use is all this research?  Why waste time and money to study obscure\
      \ stuff like the mating habits of salamanders, or the mating habits of Neanderthals,\
      \ or the mating habits of volcanoes, or the mating habits of quantum particles,\
      \ or the mating habits of saturated fats, or y\u2019know, it always seems to\
      \ be mating habits with those guys, doesn\u2019t it?\r\n\r\nThere are two problems\
      \ with simply dismissing anything you don\u2019t understand as either unimportant\
      \ or frivolous - well, really there\u2019s three, since that attitude suggests\
      \ that you've lost the mental bits which separate homo sapiens from reality\
      \ show hosts.\r\n\r\nFirst, the media\u2019s reporting on science ranges from\
      \ pitiful to anger-inducing.  We hear about medical studies spanning decades\
      \ and involving thousands of people, weighing in at 600 peer-reviewed pages\
      \ or more, summarized on the nightly news as \"Hey, maybe salt isn't as bad\
      \ for you as we thought, now over to Phil for the sports!\"  There\u2019s very\
      \ little room for nuance, context, or even the basic point of it all sometimes.\r\
      \n\r\nSecondly, science is not taught very well in schools - no shocker there.\
      \ Did YOU learn anything useful?\r\n\r\nA man I worked with once described what\
      \ it was like going to school in the early 1960s in the US.  Sputnik had just\
      \ delivered a national shock - the USSR, then thought of as technically backward\
      \ by complacent Americans fed propaganda, put a satellite into orbit in 1959,\
      \ more than a year before Americans managed anything similar.\r\n\r\nHe described\
      \ the level of science and mathematical education as \u201Calmost embarrassingly\
      \ enriched\u201D, with seemingly limitless funding springing from the floodgates\
      \ opened by a panicking Congress.\r\n\r\nThis explains why all the science equipment\
      \ I remember from the 80s was slide projectors, mimeograph machines, bakelite\
      \ lab gear and textbooks from - you guessed it - the 1960s.\r\n\r\nIt's been\
      \ pointed out that we're a species of idiots living in a world built by freak\
      \ geniuses.  We muddle along for centuries at a stretch, placidly minding our\
      \ own business, laughing at each other\u2019s burps, until one day some peasant\
      \ squats down in a muddy field and gives birth to a Gutenberg... next thing\
      \ you know, we all gotta learn how to read.\r\n\r\nSome examples of major results\
      \ springing from unexpected and humble beginnings - in the 80s, an Australian\
      \ astronomer had problems processing telescope data for research on dwarf stars.\r\
      \n\r\nHe worked out a design for a chip which could perform the math to clean\
      \ up the signals so he could get results - something to do with their mating\
      \ habits, I\u2019ve no doubt.\r\n\r\nIt turns out this silicon chip solved a\
      \ problem that kept wireless networking super expensive, and next thing you\
      \ know, wires seem old-fashioned.\r\n\r\nGo back further - in 1945 a researcher\
      \ in a postwar radar lab named Percy Spencer walks past an early magnetron tube,\
      \ and notices the chocolate bar in his pocket had melted.  Guess who\u2019s\
      \ responsible for the introduction of microwave ovens 2 years later?  Yeah,\
      \ the geek with a brown stain on his trousers.\r\n\r\nAs Isaac Asimov said,\
      \ the most exciting phrase in science is not \"EUREKA!\" but \"Hey, that's funny...\"\
      \r\n\r\nBillions have been squandered.  Promising careers wasted.  Valuable\
      \ time lost.  Sometimes quite preventably.  Other times, by the smartest of\
      \ people acting with the best of intentions.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, great breakthroughs\
      \ are achieved by dedicated folks working in their spare time, with pencil and\
      \ paper, in a garage or basement.\r\n\r\nMoney and support are not always the\
      \ answer, nor is their lack always the problem.  So I\u2019m not talking about\
      \ them.\r\n\r\nEvery story I can relate about serendipitous events, you can\
      \ probably find 100 counter-examples, many of them tragic..\r\n\r\nI believe\
      \ the good outweighs the bad.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s one: every single form of medical\
      \ imaging currently in use - from X-ray to CAT scans to ultrasound - owes credit\
      \ to discoveries by people who\u2019d been mucking around in completely unrelated\
      \ areas.  Not one of them arose as a result of purposeful medical research.\r\
      \n\r\nSo if your grandma is alive today thanks to a lump someone found early\
      \ (as is my wife\u2019s), you can thank the curiosity of people who looked like\

<p>Tim Ferriss (of 4 Hour Work Week fame) is turning 35.  His birthday wish is to raise $50,000 from the followers of his blog to help fund aspiring teachers.  If we are able to raise $50,000, he will match that with another $50,000 donation!  As of this writing, we have raised $27,181.</p>
<p>To raise the money, he is using a new 501(c)(3) nonprofit called Vittana. Donations to Vittana students are 100% tax deductible.</p>
<p>To donate:<br />1) Google &#8220;Vittana&#8221; and click on the first link<br />2) Choose &#8220;Lending Teams&#8221; at the top<br />3) Scroll down and choose &#8220;35th Birthday Challenge for Tim Ferriss!&#8221;<br />4) Choose &#8220;Join Team&#8221; in the right column 5) Connect with Facebook<br />5) Find a student, and donate!</p>
<p>I highly encourage you to consider making a difference in someone else&#8217;s life today!</p>
<p>Thanks for your time,<br />Andrew Martin<br />amartin6@stanford.edu<br />Stanford, CA</p>

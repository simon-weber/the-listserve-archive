    \ the concept behind The Listserve- using technology to keep us connected across\
    \ the world, despite locations, economic status, gender, race. I love getting\
    \ Listserve messages because I feel like I'm getting to hear bits of wisdom from\
    \ all kinds of different people who have had many years of experience on me. It's\
    \ amazing.\r\n\r\nMy message is relatively short since I'm still somewhat new\
    \ to this world myself. I'm graduating from the University of Arizona in May,\
    \ and I'll be stepping out into the huge, unknown adult world. I'm planning on\
    \ entering the field of museums, a pretty unpopular career choice among my peers.\
    \ My parents tell me I'm gonna have to marry rich just to have a comfortable life,\
    \ and my friends say I'm gonna end up being a teacher. But none of that matters\
    \ to me. Museums might seem boring (I know my sister hated getting dragged to\
    \ them) but they are vital to society and communal growth. Without a place to\
    \ engage with history, we are doomed to repeat it. And most of human history shouldn't\
    \ be repeated (in my humble opinion). So I urge you to go out to the local museum\
    \ in your town or city and spend just an hour there- reading, listening, learning.\
    \ It could surprise you how much fun you have.\r\n\r\nI know that I'm going to\
    \ leave this small city and join the broader community. I want to go out and make\
    \ an impact on the world, and let me say that I am raring to go. I hope that this\
    \ small message for posterity leaves you with a piqued interest in museums or\
    \ even just history in a broader sense, whether it be human history or just your\
    \ own personal history. There's always something to be learned from past experiences\
    \ which will enrich our future paths.\r\n\r\nMy generation is known for the somewhat\
    \ asinine phrase \"YOLO\" but if my generation is known for living life to the\
    \ fullest, then so be it. I'm down with that. Good luck everybody, and I hope\
    \ to see you all poking around your local museums one day.\r\n\r\nYou only live\
    \ once.\r\n\r\n\r\nMariah Shevchuk\r\n\r\n(I've included my email address in case\
    \ anyone wants to share tips for graduate school or any interesting museums they\
    \ know of. Thanks in advance, guys!)\r\n\r\nMariah Shevchuk\t\r\nhairam812@aol.com\t\

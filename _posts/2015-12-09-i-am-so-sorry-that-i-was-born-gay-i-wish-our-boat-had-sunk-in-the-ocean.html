      \ many choose in their heroes.  My hero to me is famous as he won a ground breaking\
      \ human rights complaint brought against Australia before the United Nations\
      \ Human Rights Committee.  The complaint lead to decriminalisation of \u2018\
      sodomy\u2019 in Australia, or in my mind the decriminalisation of simply being\
      \ gay.  You would think that my home country of Australia would learn something\
      \ from my hero\u2019s work in 1994, yet in recent years Australia has been forwarding\
      \ asylum seekers who land in Australia to Papua New Guinea (PNG) where being\
      \ homosexuality remains a crime.  My government knowingly transfers asylum seekers\
      \ into risky environments, where death is possible, and somehow believe this\
      \ is okay.  The subject of this email is from an Iranian who sought asylum in\
      \ Australia, and the Australian government forwarded him to PNG where his existence\
      \ would yet again be criminalised.  When he found out he would face similar\
      \ persecution in PNG as what he faced in Iran, he no longer felt like he was\
      \ being given any type of asylum.  I write this not to shame Australia, but\
      \ to remind people that seemingly forward thinking countries continue to persecute\
      \ minorities and asylum seekers.  The Australian government\u2019s third-country\
      \ processing of asylum seekers greatly saddens me, and I wish I knew what it\

      \ pretty good money. I wasn\u2019t passionate - at all - about what I was doing,\
      \ but so what? Most people don\u2019t like their jobs, right? I always just\
      \ took it day-by-day; watching the clock until I could go home, watching the\
      \ days until the weekend. Hey, at least I had a job \u201Cin this economy.\u201D\
      \r\n\r\nThen began a bit of a \u201Ccycle.\u201D Company layoffs.\r\n\r\nThe\
      \ first time I was only out of work for about four months. The second time,\
      \ it was well over a year. And while those days, weeks, months continue to add-up,\
      \ you begin to question yourself -- a lot. Confidence sinks. You quickly learn\
      \ that you have to find a way to fill that inner void somehow.\r\n\r\nFor me,\
      \ my camera came to the rescue. While I\u2019d never had the time to truly learn\
      \ and practice with it, now suddenly all I had was time. And I had a beautiful\
      \ city park - Forest Park, St. Louis - which I could walk to on foot. It forced\
      \ me to be minimalistic. And it got me out of the house.\r\n\r\nSoon, people\
      \ began to tell me I was good at it. I just knew that I was feeling good *about*\
      \ it, and that was the part I really needed.\r\n\r\nA few months ago I once\
      \ again found myself out of work. This time was very different as it was a rather\
      \ bad situation, working under a vicious boss. Truthfully...it was a bit like\
      \ escaping from an emotional prison.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in the strangest form, it\
      \ may have been luck.\r\n\r\nIronically, a friend had arranged a meeting for\
      \ me that same week with a small local shop to see some of my photos. To my\
      \ surprise, they were very enthusiastic and wanted to sell some of them as postcards\
      \ and see where it went. The money wasn\u2019t much at all, but it was the first\
      \ time I realized (or believed) that my photos had value. For the first time,\
      \ I didn\u2019t feel like an \u201Cimposter\u201D in the photography world.\r\
      \n\r\nI\u2019m still struggling to find my way today. I\u2019m considering Real\
      \ Estate photography as a way to earn some actual money and stay afloat. It\u2019\
      s a scary time, but at least for the moment I\u2019m not wishing my hours away\
      \ anymore. And I\u2019ve embraced valuing my days more than my annual income\
      \ statement.\r\n\r\nMaybe in the end I will realize I was \u201Clucky\u201D\
      \ after all.\r\n\r\nMaybe in the end, it\u2019s all just relative.\r\n\r\nCONTACT~\r\

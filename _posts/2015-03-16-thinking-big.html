      s so important for human beings to continually and consciously attempt to think\
      \ at scales that are beyond (unassisted) human perception\u2014atoms, global\
      \ warming, space\u2014while at the same time accepting (even taking a certain\
      \ kind of pleasure in? well, I do, at least) our limits \u2026 That\u2019s why\
      \ I love movies like Tree of Life and Melancholia that either jump-cut between\
      \ the mundane events of a single human life and, say, the surface of the sun\
      \ -or- require something crazily vast to tell a story like a rogue planet about\
      \ to crash into the earth. Or books like Climate Changed: A Personal Journey\
      \ through the Science (graphic novel) or a poem like \u201CUnnamed Dragonfly\
      \ Species\u201D by Juliana Spahr (she\u2019s amazing) in which her singular\

      \ night after night obsessively watching videos of glaciers collapsing and trying\u2014\

      \ her all the more for that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\u2026 Writing about my two sisters,\

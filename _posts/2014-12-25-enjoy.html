      \ you \u2018feel\u2019 such a belief to be right, or because you have a deep-seated\

      <p>Your time&#8217;s precious, so I&#8217;ll introduce myself and then ask a

      <p>I was born in a neighbour&#8217;s bed, following my father&#8217;s death
      and my mother&#8217;s eviction from our home connected to his job. The attending

      after a remarriage, our new family ended up living in an old railway carriage,
      perched on its wheels, in a field on the edge of a cliff overlooking the sea.
      A magical childhood followed: walking the beach to school, using sea and sand
      as our playground, standing on the headland watching thunderstorms develop over
      the waters.</p>

      <p>Those who educate us, influence our life choices and should be respected

      negative attitude, I&#8217;d have been an architect. Another was bright, attractive,

      \ email. To be honest, I almost deleted it and went back to watching old comedy\
      \ reruns.\r\n\r\nBut here we are. What can I say to entice you to read my 600\
      \ words? What do you say to twenty-something thousand people? I\u2019m 23 years\
      \ old, a recent university graduate\u2026bla bla bla.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m going\
      \ to write a thank you note.\r\n\r\nNot the kind I had to write when I was a\
      \ kid: \u2018Dear Auntie so-and-so, Thank you so much for the lovely hairband\
      \ and matching socks. I cannot wait to wear them and show my friends\u2026\u2019\
      \ (Is it just me or does everyone have a relative that buys the oddest gifts?).\
      \ Nope, this is a thank you note to an organisation that changed my life forever\
      \ when I was 10.\r\n\r\nI was lucky enough to discover choral singing when I\
      \ was 4 and very jealous that my 7 year old sister was old enough to join our\
      \ local choir. Having dipped in and out of a few choirs, my parents got me to\
      \ join a children\u2019s choir in Hertfordshire called Cantate.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019\
      s safe to say that the experiences I had at this choir until I was 18 were some\
      \ of the best of my life. Cantate, its musical directors and the friends I made\
      \ there will remain with me forever and I want to take this opportunity to gush\
      \ irritatingly and proclaim my love and thanks to all who helped me learn and\
      \ grow whilst I sang in the choir. I\u2019m so proud that Cantate is going from\
      \ strength to strength, singing as beautifully as ever and winning global competitions.\r\
      \n\r\nI\u2019m now in the alumni programme for Cantate (recently renamed Coro\
      \ 94 to reflect our founding date and strong ties to Italy, where our founder\
      \ musical director now lives) and love it just as much as ever. Having people\
      \ coming from all over the UK and abroad to sing together again 21 years after\
      \ Cantate was formed is a testament to the bond that we formed at our very first\
      \ rehearsals. As a younger member of Coro 94, it\u2019s also great to sing with\
      \ the people I idolised as a 10 year old in our Training Choir! Thank you all\
      \ for inspiring me.\r\n\r\nThe message in this somewhat overenthusiastic letter\
      \ is twofold. Firstly: join a choir. Or a team or club of any kind. Just do\
      \ something! Also, if you happen to be interested in high quality choral music\
      \ sung by truly passionate choirs, search the Internet for Cantate or Cantate\
      \ Alumni and see what takes your fancy. You won\u2019t regret it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\

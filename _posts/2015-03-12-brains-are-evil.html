      <p>1. There is an alien race at the center of the universe &#8211; let&#8217;s
      just call them the Mindvourers. Interestingly enough, as we are not fully able
      to comprehend their shape the closest approximation that makes sense to us is

      get sucked into the vortex.</p>

      <p>2. The Mindvourers&#8217; only source of food is brains &#8211; brains of
      the kind found for example in all vertebrates and most invertebrate animals
      on earth.</p>

      <p>3. Around the time they ran out of food sources on their home planet the
      Mindvourers came up with a cunning plan &#8211; a &#8220;fertilizer&#8221; for
      organic brain tissue that could be distributed across the universe with the
      goal to grow underdeveloped organic brain tissue into super brains.</p>

      <p>4. Super brains would eventually convince the host body (like for example
      us humans) to build vessels and fly to the Mindvourers&#8217; planet</p>

      <p>5. Upon arrival the super brains will be consumed through quick and easy
      suction into the vortex shaped four-leggers.</p>

      <p>Notes:<br />* The vortex shaped aliens can reverse the flow of their vortexes.
      This way they are able to create things. What mechanism exists within the vortexes

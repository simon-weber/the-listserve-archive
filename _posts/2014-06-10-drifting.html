      \ years, you may ask? Well, they were okay, but I had no idea what I wanted\
      \ to do. I had pretty much drifted through life without any goals, or at least,\
      \ none that had stuck. But for the last eight years I have been working at my\
      \ dream job and I simply stumbled into it.\r\n\r\nYou see, I love cars. Ever\

      \ remember as well.\r\n\r\nFor the past eight years I have had a job where car\
      \ manufacturers give me brand new cars to drive for a week so I can write about\
      \ them. They fly me all over the world to exotic locations, put me up in five-star\

      \ especially for someone who loves cars (and booze). It was my dream job when\

      \ journalist\u201D.\r\n\r\nWhen I did, I was in awe - people were actually paid\
      \ to drive cars and write about them? That has to be the ultimate job, my nine-year-old\

      \ (you bleed quite a lot and the cat never goes in) or what the inside of the\
      \ digital clock looks like (pretty much exactly like a broken digital clock)\
      \ and the idea of writing about cars became a distant dream.\r\n\r\nBut here\u2019\
      s the really annoying part for anyone who is driven, highy-motivated and chases\
      \ determinedly after their dream: I didn\u2019t get this job by charging after\
      \ it in a focussed fashion, studying journalism and reading everything I could\
      \ about cars. I didn\u2019t relentlessly harass editors and publishers to let\
      \ me write about cars for them. Nope, like all the best things that have ever\
      \ happened to me, it just happened when I was least expecting it.\r\n\r\nEight\
      \ years ago I was in the right place at the right time and after 33 years of\

      \ don\u2019t live with my mother anymore either  (but I still vist regularly!).\r\
      \n\r\nSure, the stress levels get pretty high around deadline time and being\
      \ a freelancer means you pretty much have to be constantly on the lookout for\

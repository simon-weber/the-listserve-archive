    body: "Hello, I'm from Brazil. You probably don't know much about us now, but\
      \ you probably will during the next World Cup. I was unsure what to write about,\
      \ until I saw, last night, June 13, 2013, all hell break loose in the city of\
      \ S\xE3o Paulo. It started as a protest against raising bus taxes - described\
      \ in an apologetic way by politicians as 'under inflation margin', as if they\
      \ had nothing to do with that. But after 3 days of protest, it became much more\
      \ than that. It was a protest against the government priorities, and how the\
      \ people still go hungry while over-budgeted, unfinished World Cup construction\
      \ sites that have become an excuse to steal the people's money - I mean literally\
      \ steal.\r\n\r\nAnd the protesters said that. In signs, on the internet, in\
      \ interviews. The peaceful protest was met with an unjustified attack of tear\
      \ gas and rubber bullets. And it made me cringe to watch what was happening\
      \ live, while listening to the reporters saying that the opposite was going\
      \ on. People had been arrested before manifestations started - for possession\
      \ of vinegar. Vinegar is used to minimize effects from tear gas. Which means\
      \ people were being arrested for trying to protect themselves against the police.\
      \ Did they expect them to receive the violence with open arms? The manifestation\
      \ became then, also for the right of speaking out against the government, and\
      \ against unnecessary violent police repression. It was a protest for our right\
      \ to protest.\r\n\r\nThe manifestation was violently disrupted. Police closed\
      \ entire streets with the excuse that they didn't want the protest to close\
      \ streets (?) and then called themselves successful for reopening such streets.\
      \ Legislation is being made to qualify public manifestations such as this as\
      \ terrorism (PL 728/2011) and in my city, public manifestations were FORBIDDEN\
      \ during the international soccer championships. A civil right, forbidden, in\
      \ order to make us look good. For you.\r\n\r\nNow this might seem to you like\
      \ a horrible isolated event. It's not. It's commonplace, really. Our police\
      \ military forces are a leftover organization from the dictatorial far right\
      \ military government that took over our country from 1964 to 1985. For 21 years,\
      \ we were stripped of all individual rights, silently tortured and killed, and\
      \ forced to live in fear. And considering public manifestations of citizens\
      \ as terrorism was one of their excuses for it.\r\n\r\nSo I'm writing because\
      \ you need to know, that if you see a peaceful country during the World Cup,\
      \ you are being lied to. Governors will state that things like the recent rape\
      \ of an American tourist is rare, when it is actually epidemic and rising. Two\
      \ Brazilian women had already been raped by the same gang and the police did\
      \ nothing. They would have stayed that way if they hadn't made the horrible\
      \ mistake of raping a foreign woman.\r\n\r\nWe are angry, but also afraid. How\
      \ to fight against this? And the answer is: You. The one thing our government\
      \ fears is to look bad in front of international entrepreneurs and investors.\
      \  So search for this online. Find our videos and statements. Spread it out.\
      \ Put our real reasons for protesting in the news. Help us achieve our right\
      \ to protest, our right to speak out against oppression, the right to live without\
      \ fear of the government.  We have an unique opportunity to make ourselves visible\
      \ to the whole world, during the World Cup of 2014. Make it count.\r\n\r\n\r\

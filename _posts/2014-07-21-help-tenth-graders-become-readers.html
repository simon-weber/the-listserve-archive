      I love my job because of my students, who are kind, thoughtful, and unthinkably
      resilient kids who all want a satisfying and stable life. The biggest obstacle
      between my students and success is literacy. Without strong reading and writing
      skills, graduation and college admission become impossible dreams. To raise
      literacy, we need an enormous supply of engaging, diverse texts, a library where
      any student can find a book that they can''t put down. In the last year, I have
      worked non-stop to build the only classroom library in our school, collecting
      from willing publishers, friends, and other schools. I''m happy to go anywhere
      I can in/near New York City to add even a book or two to our classroom, and
      the result has been a classroom already full of books, and a tenth-grade recognized

      \r\nMy life took a complete change for the better when I took matters into my\
      \ own hands. I was always a bright kid and at the insistence of my parents I\
      \ went to the university, put myself in debt, and got a BA in a field that I\
      \ wasn't too crazy about, Psychology. Had it been up to me, I would've studied\
      \ art.\r\n\r\nAfter I graduated I was burnt out from school and I knew I didn't\
      \ want to pursue Psychology any further. So I did what any other angsty, passionate\
      \ twenty-something year old does and ran away into the wilderness. Yeah, actually,\
      \ what I did was I picked up a seasonal job and spent the next five months living,\
      \ working, and exploring in Yosemite National Park. To say it rejuvenated my\
      \ spirit is a complete understatement, I not only had a national park as my\
      \ playgrounds and backyard, I was in YOSEMITE. I was hiking, having a great\
      \ time, and taking photographs of my adventures along the way and the scenic\
      \ landscapes. I even made a small book for friends and family of my time there.\r\
      \n\r\nAfter my stint there was done, I knew there was no way I could return\
      \ to the desert wasteland that is the Inland Empire, CA. My soul was on fire\
      \ and needed to be stoked. So I followed the rest of the transients, packed\
      \ up all my belongings in my car, and drove up the coast (a worthy endeavor\
      \ everyone should try at least once), did my first solo camping expedition in\
      \ Big Sur, and moved to Portland, OR. I met some of the kindest, greatest people\
      \ I have ever met and some incredible friends I intend to keep for life (including\
      \ the one who introduced me to the listserve, HI CASEY, LUV YEW!) as well as\
      \ the love of my life, but that's a completely other heartwarming story. I loved\
      \ Portland with my entire being, but after spending half a year in the wilderness\
      \ I was restless for more than sleepy little Portland had to offer, no matter\
      \ how good it was for me. The job market was awful and I was stuck working a\
      \ job I hated, so at the insistence of a good friend I moved to Seattle not\
      \ even having spent a full year in Portland.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been in Seattle\
      \ now for six months and I\u2019m pursuing my dream of photography. I\u2019\
      m mixing it up a bit though and combining my love of adventure, the great outdoors,\
      \ and portrait photography to create some really badass wedding photography.\
      \ At least, that\u2019s the goal. I\u2019ve been lucky enough that the community\
      \ in Seattle is incredibly welcoming and I\u2019ve reached out to some photographers\
      \ whose work I admire and they\u2019ve lent me a helping hand, I\u2019m constantly\
      \ humbled and grateful for this community and to have found something that I\u2019\
      m enjoying creating so very much. My goal is to become a destination photographer\
      \ and use this as a means of traveling all over the world, experiencing new\
      \ cultures and meeting wonderful people along the way.\r\n\r\nThere may be a\
      \ lesson in this somewhere, but really this is just my path and how it\u2019\
      s turned out. I\u2019m just starting out, it can only go up from here. I\u2019\
      m one of the lucky ones.\r\n\r\nBut my restless spirit can\u2019t be tamed and\

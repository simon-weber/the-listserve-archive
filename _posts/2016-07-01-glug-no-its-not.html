      Before going into what's been happening in Bangkok this year, some background\
      \ is essential. Not just on Thaksin Shinawatra himself but also on Thai politics\
      \ in general. Let's start with Thaksin. The man is a billionaire who made his\
      \ pile getting sweetheart deal contracts from the Thai Government for work in\
      \ modernizing Thai telecommunications infrastructure. He was also a Lieutenant\
      \ Colonel in the Thai Police. When he first entered politics, his act was quite\
      \ revolutionary. Normally a Thai political campaign consists of the candidate\
      \ publishing lists of worthy people who support him. In effect, they provide\
      \ lists of references that more or less state \"I am a good person and can be\
      \ trusted to work in your interests.\" People then voted for whoever paid them\
      \ the most. In Thailand, it's quite possible to have a worthwhile debate on\
      \ whether vote buying is wrong or not. Thaksin changed that. He conducted a\
      \ western-style campaign that put a portfolio of promised policies out and invited\
      \ people to judge his party on the basis of those policies. This was so different\
      \ that it worked rather well. His Party became the largest in the Thai Parliament\
      \ and he pushed through the items on his agenda (low cost medical care, low-interest\
      \ loans for farmers and a few other things, all calculated to endear himself\
      \ to the rural population - note still buying votes but wholesale rather than\
      \ retail and using Government money to do it). When the next election came up,\
      \ his party wasn't just the largest one, it actually had an overall majority.\r\
      \n\r\nThis made Thaksin's real objectives critical. Thaksin is (or was) a great\
      \ admirer of the Singaporean model of government and industry. He wanted to\
      \ create a new Thai state in which there was a single party (controlled by him)\
      \ and a single corporate entity (controlled by him). The fact that Singapore\
      \ doesn't really work that way is neither here nor there. Thaksin wanted a state\
      \ where there was no center of government or economic power that was outside\
      \ his control. With a majority in Parliament, he set about achieving just that.\
      \ Hold that thought.\r\n\r\nNow, let's look at Thai politics. Thailand is an\
      \ odd place; it's one of the few countries in the world where the political\
      \ establishment openly says \"we're politicians, don\u2019t trust us.\" There\
      \ is an ongoing presumption in the country that political shakeups should never\
      \ be seen in terms of black and white. The message is to look with skepticism\
      \ on political changes and to assume that all political movements are corrupt\
      \ and tainted by greed and ambition. There is an assumption that all are backed\
      \ by a hidden hand that is pushing a secret agenda. This is an intensely cynical\
      \ view of course, and one that leaves no room to suppose that a protest is both\
      \ genuine and sincere.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecky\r\nlistserv@minichan.org\t\r\nThe United\

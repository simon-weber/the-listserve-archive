    body: "When I was 6, my mom and dad got a divorce and my mom moved to NY. My sister\
      \ remembers standing on our driveway in Florida waving goodbye as she drove\
      \ away in her white station wagon. As a young girl, I didn\u2019t quite understand\
      \ where she was going and why. They say your subconscious belief patterns are\
      \ formed by the age of 6. These are the beliefs responsible for the way a person\
      \ thinks and behaves, basically lives their lives, and can affect relationships,\
      \ career, finances and more. When my mom moved away, I downloaded the belief\
      \ \u201CI am not worthy of being loved.\u201D If my mother can\u2019t even stay\
      \ with me, who ever will? Since then, anytime anyone gets close to me, I repel.\
      \ I retreat. I run. I run for a safe place where no one can ever leave me again,\
      \ and subsequently, that\u2019s left me harboring quite a bit of sadness.\r\n\
      Growing up my older sister and I played, all day, every day. We used our imaginations\
      \ to escape the grief we had internalized. We became best friends and did everything\
      \ together. Over time, we drifted apart. She grew disgruntled and angry and\
      \ took a lot of her pain out on me. I understand now, but at the time, I didn\u2019\
      t. I just thought I was worthy of punishment, like it was my fault all this\
      \ had happened. It wasn\u2019t until recently I started to put my story together,\
      \ and understand, how early childhood events affect us, even well into our adulthood\
      \ years. I found ACoA- Adult Children of Alcoholics- a program, like AA, for\
      \ anyone who has experienced family dysfunction intending to teach you to become\
      \ your own loving parent.\r\nWe all carry these voices inside our head: \u201C\
      you can\u2019t do that,\u201D \u201Cyou aren\u2019t ready\u201D \u201Cno one\
      \ will care about your story,\u201D \u201Cyou can\u2019t quit your job and pursue\
      \ your dreams.\u201D All of which prevent us from living the lives we yearn\
      \ for. It\u2019s interesting to tune into these thoughts and ask, is this me\
      \ or my mom or dad or sister or crazy uncle speaking? Likely, if the voice is\
      \ negative, it isn\u2019t your own. It\u2019s coming from someone else who at\
      \ some point said you weren\u2019t good enough or that skirt is ugly, and now\
      \ you fear fully expressing yourself or doing something you really want to do.\
      \ The good thing is we are all equipped with the tools to change. It just takes\
      \ patience and practice and most importantly forgiveness. We need to forgive\
      \ ourselves for all we didn\u2019t do or did do that wasn\u2019t aligned with\
      \ our own best interests. We need to forgive others knowing also they were just\
      \ trying to do the best they could carrying whatever pain they had at that time.\
      \ Don Henley had it right. The heart of the matter is forgiveness. In order\
      \ to move forward in life, we must forgive ourselves for the burden of the past\
      \ (or present) and out of love, give ourselves the opportunity to live a life\
      \ we desire, not what others desire for us, but what we want for ourselves.\r\
      \nI\u2019d be happy to hear from anybody about your own stories of the past\
      \ or present and how you\u2019ve healed and grown or have yet to do so. Perhaps,\
      \ we could help each other heal together.\r\n\r\nKimberly\_\r\nShelter, Island.\

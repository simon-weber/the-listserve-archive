      \ that died of cancer is scary and sad but the statistics are even scarier and\
      \ sadder.  For example:  46 kids EVERY DAY are diagnosed with cancer but it\
      \ is still INSANELY UNDERFUNDED (at least in the U.S.) The National Cancer Institute\u2019\
      s (NCI) federal budget was $4.6 billion. Of that, breast cancer received 12%,\
      \ prostate cancer received 7%, and all 12 major groups of pediatric cancers\
      \ combined received less than 3%.\r\n\r\n  THIS IS NOT OKAY!!! However, I have\

      \ fight against ALS \u2013 including a journey to   Mach Pichu (!!)  and you\u2019\
      ll see why that motto fits perfectly\r\n Favorite quote by Steve Gleason:  \u201C\
      I believe heroes take adversity or tragedy, turn it into opportunity, and  then\
      \ share the opportunity with others, so the others can do the same. In a sense,\
      \ we all have a chance to be heroes, to some degree. I\u2019ve happened to have\

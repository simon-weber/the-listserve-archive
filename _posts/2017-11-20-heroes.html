      <p>- I''m a donor recruitment volunteer for the Anthony Nolan Trust in the UK
      - check them out, or find their equivalent in your country. I donated bone marrow
      myself through them a few years ago and it was a very easy way to make a very
      big difference to a stranger. The thank you card I received from the stranger
      whose life was saved was the best post I ever got. </p>

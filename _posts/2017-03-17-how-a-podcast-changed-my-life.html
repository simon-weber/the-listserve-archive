      </p>

      <p>Randomly, just under two years ago, I listened to an episode of ''The Rich
      Roll Podcast''...</p>

      <p>Here''s how 2 years worth of listening to every single episode has changed
      my life:</p>

      <p>Food<br />I started to experiment with a whole-foods, plant-based diet. Here''s
      what happened: my sleep improved, my energy increased, I lost weight, some nagging
      injuries I had for years went away, I decreased my recovery time from workouts,
      my anxiety went way down, and I gained an appreciation for this planet, as well
      as ALL living things that is difficult to put into words. I guess vegetables
      are some powerful stuff. </p>

      <p>Drinking<br />Most of my 20s were based around partying, and look - it was
      a lot of fun! But when I was in the thick of drinking every weekend I never
      realized how much time I was losing to it (the nights, poor sleep, hangovers,
      etc.) When alcohol wasn''t in the way, all of a sudden I had so much more time.
      Plus, my general happiness post-booze is noticeably higher. I''m much more appreciative,
      confident and happy without the stuff. </p>

      called the Hyperbits Masterclass where I teach something simple, but incredibly
      complicated: making music on a computer. This pursuit, paired with hundreds
      of Rich Roll podcast interviews, taught me to be more genuine. Turns out, people
      really appreciate that. When you''re selling a product, trust is everything.</p>

      keeps me calmer, more focused and helps me generate an appreciation for life

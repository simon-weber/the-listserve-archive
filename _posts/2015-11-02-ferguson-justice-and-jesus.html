      <p>(I wrote the above during the Baltimore Uprising.)</p>

      <p>Yesterday, I was with Hands Up United organizers in St. Louis. Suddenly,
      they got a message on their phones and pain overtook their faces. Another young
      black male was killed by police near Ferguson. (Witnesses say police shot him
      from 6 feet away in the mouth. The police report says he shot himself. If you
      want more info or to see the heartbreaking video of his mother screaming, &#8220;Don&#8217;t
      shoot my baby!&#8221; look up #AmonderezGreen. Yes, another young black male
      has become a hashtag.)</p>

      <p>If we don&#8217;t see Jesus as a marginalized brown-skinned Jew living on
      the underside of the oppressive system of the Roman Empire, then we don&#8217;t
      really see Jesus. If we don&#8217;t know that the Gospel speaks directly to
      the foreigner, the poor, and the minority, then we don&#8217;t really know the

      <p>The Church has been absent from this conversation and complicit in oppression.
      I&#8217;m sorry. We can do better because Jesus calls us to be better.</p>

<p>He is everywhere.</p>
<p>Lurking in the woodsmoke that fills the house in winter, there's a memory of the first time we built a fire together.</p>
<p>Cleverly tucked into the taste of cinnamon and cider, there's a memory of us walking underneath the changing leaves, steaming mugs of autumn in our hands.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it's not so simple.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it's a whiff of cologne in a crowd, and I am reminded of a shirt he used to own-- and the memory of that shirt unlocks whole passages of time spent together I hadn't thought of in years.  The images come flooding back; the porch we'd argue on, the bed we slept in, the trip we planned for months and never took.</p>
<p>You know the feeling: all it takes is one tiny thing, a domino, and a whole world of the past tumbles into focus. Triggered by a smell.  A touch.  A song.</p>
<p>Memory.</p>

<p>Let's play a game.</p>
<p>My name is Olga Nunes. I'm a singer, and for the past two years, I've been working on an album called LAMP.  LAMP has a story woven around it, and I'd very much like for you to be a part of that story.  </p>

<p>Call this number: 1.415.857.0589</p>
<p>It leads to a Google voicemail box; you can call it from anywhere.  When you call, you will be asked a question.  Answer it.</p>
<p><br /> 4.</p>
<p>I'll post those answers to a blog just for this, and will make them part of the LAMP story.</p>
<p>Feel free to Google "Olga Nunes LAMP" to hear the songs, or see how this has unfolded so far.</p>
<p>I look forward to your call.	</p>
<p><br />With Warmth, <br />Olga Nunes <br />olga@olganunes.com <br />San Francisco, California</p>
<p>P.S. Just in case: if the number gives you a busy signal, try calling back. </p>

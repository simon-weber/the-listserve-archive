      I look back at all the emails I have received since joining Listserve and I
      still can&#8217;t figure out what to write. I guess a good place to start is
      to introduce myself.</p>

      <p>Hi, I&#8217;m Corrine and I&#8217;m 17 years. I live in Illinois with my
      aunt and our two cats.  I started to live with my aunt back in September when
      my mom ended up in a nursing home.  My mom is unable to take care of herself
      anymore. I go to visit her once a week in nursing home. Just yesterday (Saturday)
      we went out for dinner.</p>

      <p>I like to do a lot of different things in my free time. I listen to music.
      My current obsessions are Tegan and Sara, Arctic Monkeys, The Strokes, David
      Bowie, Bob Dylan, and Tame Impala. I am also obsessed with Netflix. I&#8217;m
      currently working my way through Orange is the New Black and Supernatural. Both
      those shows will be the death of me. I also watch a lot of movies.  I just watched
      The Boys Are Back. I hope to be able to get to the library soon to check out
      the book that the movie is based on. Generally I try to read the book before
      I go see the movie.</p>

      <p>I also like to Skype/text my boyfriend A LOT.  Well when your boyfriend lives
      851.8 miles away you do tend to get a bit attached to technology. I can&#8217;t
      imagine having a long distance relationship before smartphones/internet was
      invented.  We met online in IRC (Internet Relay Chat) channel the night before
      Easter of 2013. He had sent me a message. At some point during the conversation
      totally out of character for me I said, &#8220;I think I&#8217;m falling for
      you. From there we exchanged numbers. I love him dearly and hope to meet him
      at some point. I don&#8217;t think it will be anytime soon. He just got accepted
      into fire school and will be becoming an official firefighter.</p>

      <p>I love to get to know y&#8217;all but before I end this email I will leave
      you with a few of my favorite quotes:</p>

      <p>&#8220;A hero is someone who understands the responsibility that comes with
      his freedom.&#8221; -Bob Dylan</p>

      <p>"I''m one of those people you have to watch or else I''ll wander off into
      the woods and forget to come back" -Jack White</p>

      <p>"In the future everyone will be world famous for fifteen minutes."- Andy
      Warhol</p>

      <p>My current favorite song is &#8220; A Miracle&#8221; by My little Pony</p>

      <p>What is your current favorite song</p>

    body: "Happiness is a contrast emotion, wherever you are, happiness is one conversation\
      \ away. \r\n\r\nThe bigger the things you commit yourself to tackling the smaller\
      \ your everyday miseries tend to become in contrast.\r\n\r\nThis is provided\
      \ that you have enough integrity so as to take authentic actions to honour your\
      \ word and keep your commitments. When you stop acting authentically, that is\
      \ a source of misery.\r\n\r\nIt is not enough to commit to things in your own\
      \ head (actually the less time you spend in there the better.) Three words said\
      \ to another are worth 3000 words said to yourself. You must share your commitment.\r\
      \n\r\nMy commitment is to a world that works for all living things.\r\n\r\n\
      This commitment is a wellspring of happiness. As long as I get decent sleep.\
      \ ( I have had depression when sleep deprived eg. my teenage years.) \r\n\r\n\
      So what authentic actions are being taken? One thing I have noticed is that\
      \ when you make a really big commitment in service of others you tend to hang\
      \ with great people so a lot of great stuff gets done. Special thanks to; Kerrie\
      \ Liao, Sean O'Sullivan, James Whelton, Marie-Noelle Keijzer, Sally hudson,\
      \ Aubrey de Grey and the many others who get stuff done with grace, ease and\
      \ love.\r\n\r\nA world that works has to be broken down in to several realms\
      \ and the prevailing discourse in each realm analysed to discover new contexts\
      \ that can be created to address what is not working. ( Yeah I know and go on\
      \ figure it out ) :-)\r\n\r\nIn the realm of environment - \r\nTrees make clouds\
      \ - Clouds reflect sunshine - increase equatorial albedo through a 2% increase\
      \ in cloud cover and you put a stopper in global warming for a while. So plant\
      \ trees! You see it rains where there are rain-forests because rain forests\
      \ make it rain. WeForest has planted 6,000,000 trees empowering impoverished\
      \ women to be come food foresters to assist themselves and the planet. I am\
      \ committed to not flying until we plant 100 million trees.\r\n\r\nIn the realm\
      \ of entrepreneurialism - \r\nSynthetic Biology is about to leap from the province\
      \ of the large corporates and universities to the province or startup entrepreneurs.\
      \ My daughters type 1 diabetes pointed me at synthetic biology as a way to make\
      \ her insulin, Through our SynBioaxlr8r and HAXLR8R programs we are supporting\
      \ entrepreneurs to get a head start right now. If you know a budding entrepreneur\
      \ then direct them to our programs where they will get mentoring and cash.\r\
      \n\r\nIn the realm of medicine - \r\nAs a founding board member of SENS ( health\
      \ span is more important than life span ) I get to see the latest technology\
      \ around health. Issues with resuscitative techniques have lead to heelgood\
      \ a charity around redefining CPR ergonomics. They also lead me to Dr Lentz\
      \ and the International Immunology foundation who appear to have as close to\
      \ a generic cure for cancer as I have yet seen with the lowest risk of complications\
      \ of any treatment I have heard of.\r\n\r\nIn the realm of education -\r\nComputer\
      \ programming is a language skill and the best coders are poets in that they\
      \ combine their creativity with an economy of expression. When is the best time\
      \ to learn a language?\r\nCoderDojo is a global movement of clubs for kids aged\
      \ 5-17 that provides an open and totally free learning environment for kids\
      \ to learn to code. It is in 43 countries and if there is not one near you its\
      \ open source and free of charge so you can start your own. Kids who can code\
      \ get such a great grasp of technology and if you don't \"get\" technology then\
      \ you are at the mercy of the technology and those who do \"get\" it.\r\n\r\n\
      In the realm of family - \r\nWe live of an organic small holding and grow a\
      \ fair bit of our own food. We home school our kids some of whom also go to\
      \ CoderDojo. Many thanks to Gary Chapman's Five Love Languages and also to Mark\
      \ Goulston's just listen. I am eagerly anticipating the day when our three kids\
      \ state the missions they have in life. Above all family takes time and that\
      \ time is worth it. When I do not put in the time that too is a source of misery.\r\
      \n\r\nSo my commitments and actions bring happiness even when I fail and I guess\
      \ I failed and continued to fail a bit more than most. Failure is a core part\
      \ of the context of learning so failure can also be a gateway to happiness.\
      \ Oh and because happiness is a contrast emotion you cannot be happy all the\
      \ time and you can be happy when you choose and happier in general and while\
      \ you cannot make anyone else happy you can be of service, be polite and authentically\
      \ be of good cheer which are the next best things.\r\n\r\nI wish you all great\

  body: "Why did I cling to him?  New neighborhood, new school, new hormones, summer\

    \ flame.  From the age of 13 to 22, I took him in like poison, drop by drop. \
    \ I still occasionally fight the thoughts and self doubt put in place over 8 years\
    \ ago.  You couldn't tell me anything; I would defend him and make you sorry you\
    \ ever questioned our relationship.  Through cheating, verbal abuse, physical\
    \ altercations, humiliation, and manipulation, I let that poison take over my\
    \ young mind.  Like a drop of ink in water, it spread inside me, it took over\
    \ my thoughts.  What he said about my imperfections had to be true, right? What\
    \ he wanted, I would fight to give him.  I loved him more than I loved myself\
    \ and destructively gave him everything I had so he would feel the same about\
    \ me.  I knew deep down it wasn't what love was supposed to be.\r\n\r\nI had a\
    \ loving home, with parents that still have me in awe of their love for one another.\
    \ I had an example and I knew what a healthy relationship looked like.  I was\
    \ going to change him, make him be the person I thought he could be!  In the 8th\
    \ year, it was a spring day and we had been fighting.  I was on my way from college,\
    \ at this point we lived together which made way for a whole new kind of control\
    \ and manipulation.  I maneuvered my car down the winding back road, and as tears\
    \ rolled down my face, I approached train tracks.  I so clearly remember thinking,\
    \ feeling, so defeated.  \u201CI DO NOT CARE, I GIVE UP, and I\u2019M TIRED\u201D\
    , I graphically pictured the train coming, and me, in that defeat, not reacting,\
    \ not caring what happened to me. Genuinely not caring.\r\n\r\nI cry now, for\
    \ the feeble girl I was.  It was in that moment, on that familiar road, I realized\
    \ that I was lost.\r\n\r\nThat was the start of the end for us.  That time in\
    \ my life made me the wife, the woman, the mother, the daughter, the dreamer I\
    \ am today.  I hope to bring young girls in schools, and in my community to the\
    \ mat for self-love.  For I found the hard way, in life, like in yoga, all the\
    \ strength and love I need, is within me.\r\n\r\nIn every pose, a building, I\

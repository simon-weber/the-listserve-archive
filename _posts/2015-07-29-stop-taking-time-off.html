      \ any number of things, from teaching to traveling, from research and working\

      \nJustifying a choice of how to spend some period of your life as \u201Ctaking\

      \ Framing your decision to teach abroad or with a domestic fellowship, or pursue\
      \ an Americorps fellowship, for example, as \u201Ctaking a couple of years off\
      \ to _____\u201D devalues the profession and the community in which you will\

      \ significant others as \u201Ctaking a break\u201D trivializes the value that\
      \ these relationships bring to your life. Explaining a decision to travel the\
      \ world as \u201Ctaking some time off\u201D cheapens the incredible contribution\
      \ that travel and exploration lend to personal growth and development, as well\
      \ as the joy and utility that the experience itself provides.\r\n\r\nThe rhetorical\
      \ structure of \u201Ctime off to _____\u201D implies that the activity or experiences\
      \ filling in that blank are somehow separate from the \u201Creal world\u201D\
      \ or from a person\u2019s \u201Creal life\u201D. In actuality there is no \u201C\
      taking time off\u201D from life- there\u2019s only living it. Many of the experiences\
      \ we qualify and justify with the expression\u201Ctaking time off\u201D are\
      \ among the most formidable and important of our lives. They will impact your\
      \ relationships, self-identity and yes, even your career, for years to come-\
      \ in both tangible and intangible ways.\r\n\r\nWe make important decisions on\
      \ how to spend portions of our lives for all sorts of reasons. Some are professional,\
      \ some are personal, and some are simply because it\u2019s what we wanted to\
      \ do. Sometimes the path is linear, and sometimes it takes longer to see the\
      \ full importance of an experience. But none of this means that the time we\
      \ spend growing our relationships, our horizons, and ourselves has to be explained\
      \ as \u201Ctime off.\u201D Just because a decision doesn\u2019t fit into a common\
      \ social narrative of what you should do doesn\u2019t mean that it isn\u2019\
      t a valuable experience in your life.\r\n\r\nSo pursue the fellowship. Teach.\
      \ Live at home and work at that coffee shop. Travel. Invest significant time\
      \ in your relationships. Do all of these things or none of these things\u2026\
      but let\u2019s just please stop \u201Ctaking time off\u201D to do them.\r\n\r\

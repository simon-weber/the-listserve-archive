      \ you try too hard to nail it down and the reason you wanted to do the thing\
      \ in the first place seems to just slip through your fingers.\r\n\r\nSo my question\
      \ is: what the fuck's with that?\r\n\r\nOnce commitment has been made to doing\
      \ a thing (take for example, writing this email), what is the force that keeps\
      \ us from nailing it down?\r\n\r\nIs it the fear of judgement? What will 22k\
      \ people think of my email? Internet trolls are real and vicious and perfectly\

      \ that I could have talked about literally anything else?\r\n\r\nThe fear of\

      \ of it - and therefore, by default, I'll send the shittiest email.\r\n\r\n\
      What I'm trying too hard to get at is: why is anxiety such a bitch? It gets\

      \ it is narcissistic in nature, anxiety deflates instead of inflates. It allows\
      \ for space instead of taking up space. It makes try hards try harder.\r\n\r\

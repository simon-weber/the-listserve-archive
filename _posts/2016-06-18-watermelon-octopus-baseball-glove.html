      <p>It''s been a big year for me. I''ve moved way out of my comfort zone with
      both my job and current location, and as a young person have learned a lot about
      myself in the process. Most importantly? Having the mindset to just go for it.
      I realized for far too long I wasn''t taking much initiative when it came to
      seeking out what I wanted. So, I made a change and just decided to do a simple
      thing--ask. It got me my job, helped me make new friends in a new place, and
      overall has been the best thing I''ve ever done. Sure you get shot down sometimes,
      but at least you won''t be tossing and turning at night asking yourself "what
      if". It''s the reason why I decided to go for it and move to London this coming
      fall, too.</p>

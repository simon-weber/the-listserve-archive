    body: "Since November 9, I've felt like I'm in a bad dream from which I can't\
      \ wake. I'm so afraid of what will happen over the next few years. I have found\
      \ some comfort in doing small things - sending mail, setting aside little bits\
      \ of money to be able to help people.\r\n\r\nMy wife and I belong to the United\
      \ Church of Christ - we were married there 5 years ago. If you\u2019re ever\
      \ in the Miami area and want to check out a church that takes action to make\
      \ the world a better place, encourages you to think and examine your beliefs,\
      \ and celebrates EVERYONE, regardless of age, race, language spoken, gender\
      \ identity, sexual orientation, or theistic (or non-) inclination, I invite\
      \ you to visit Coral Gables Congregational United Church of Christ. (We also\
      \ have a really good choir.)\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy data and details, you might\
      \ be interested in being a digital volunteer. Basically, you take handwritten\
      \ (or other non-machine-readable) documents and transcribe them. There are many\
      \ organizations that need this \u2013 the Smithsonian is one. The documents\
      \ could be diaries, archaeological excavation records, birdwatching journals,\
      \ maps, sounds, old menus, or geological images. Do a search for \u201Cdigital\
      \ volunteer transcription\u201D or email me.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a bit of relationship\
      \ (marriage, partnership, friendship) advice*\r\nPart 1: You can endure anything\
      \ for one second at a time - literally. Put your hand in a fire, step on a nail,\
      \ hit yourself in the face; you can take it all for one second. Sometimes you\
      \ just have to keep choosing to love your person for one second at a time, and\
      \ that\u2019s OK.\r\nPart 2: Ask for acknowledgement, even for little things,\
      \ even if they are your job, even if you feel like you shouldn\u2019t need it.\
      \ Examples: \u201CI would like to be acknowledged for putting the dishes away\u2026\
      cleaning up the cat vomit\u2026being impatient in the car but not yelling at\
      \ you.\u201D Better than a gold star.\r\n   *the above advice applies only to\
      \ good relationships that you WANT to be in.\r\n\r\nShout out to my amazing\
      \ wife Cristina, the love and light of my life for the past 11 years \u2013\
      \ I love you and can\u2019t wait for the next 60 or so (70! 80! 90! who knows?).\

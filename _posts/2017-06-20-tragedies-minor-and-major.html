    body: "When I was in the eighth grade, I had a crush on a boy. He invited me to\
      \ go to the school dance \"together\" which meant meeting there and hanging\
      \ out, and I was thrilled. He never showed and I spent the whole night crying\
      \ with my already fragile middle school self-esteem in tatters. I got over it\
      \ as quickly as one could expect and we went our separate ways to separate high\
      \ schools, where two years later in a creative writing class I wrote a story\
      \ based on the experience (which is below if you want to read it).\r\n\r\nIn\
      \ college, in the fall of 2008, I came across him on facebook and messaged him\
      \ to reconnect; the first thing he said was that he still felt terrible about\
      \ the dance. We chatted back and forth for a while about where life had taken\
      \ us and reminisced about our shared formative years, but my last message to\
      \ him never got a response.\r\n\r\nThis week I got a facebook notification that\
      \ it was his birthday, and for the first time in almost ten years I remembered\
      \ that he existed. I clicked on his profile for a dose of nostalgia and voyeurism\
      \ and found that he had died by suicide in the spring of 2009. I keep thinking\
      \ about him and the life he lived, and the life I lived while I simultaneously\
      \ assumed and forgot he was alive at all.\r\n\r\nThanks for the chance to share.\r\
      \n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAmmonia and Amontillado\r\n\r\n            She walked into\
      \ to the classroom, brightly lit by fluorescent lights, with hideous orange\
      \ bookcases and rows of scarred desks and plastic seats. The windows were covered\
      \ in black paper and there was no indication of the time, since the clock in\
      \ the front of the room had been around since 1964 and finally quit last week.\
      \ The room was empty except a short, squat lady wearing a purple striped blouse\
      \ and matching pants, shoes, and jewelry. She sat at a round table made of the\
      \ same pukey orange plastic as the cabinets, sipping a cup of black coffee,\
      \ leaving a cherry kiss on the white rim. She was making marks in a spiral bound\
      \ book, which sat next to a stack of stapled papers. As she tainted the students\u2019\
      \ efforts with degrading words of castigation, the monotonous note signaling\
      \ the start of class sounded, causing the heavy teal door to open and the eighth\
      \ graders to file in, thumping their backpacks on the ground and dropping into\
      \ their seats unceremoniously. The teacher flinched with the first thump and\
      \ then got up to the front of the room and began to instruct.\r\n\r\n      \
      \      All the faces of the students looked uninterested and tired. One boy\
      \ was sneaking food from under his desk to his mouth. A few doodled on their\
      \ skins, and one carved his initials into his desk. There was only one girl\
      \ who appeared to care about the teacher\u2019s words, set apart by her bright,\
      \ awake eyes. She took notes on a sheet of loose-leaf. In the desk next to her\
      \ sat her foil - a male chewing gum, text messaging a friend under his desk.\
      \ He loudly popped a bubble, catching the girl\u2019s attention, and she looked\
      \ at him. He grinned and she turned her head quickly, trying to hide the corners\
      \ of her mouth as they involuntarily began turning up. In between bullet points,\
      \ she scrawled something on a crisp piece of binder paper and slid it across\
      \ the desk to him. After a bit of discreet note-passing, he had convinced her\
      \ to distract the teacher while he left to grab lunch before the lines became\
      \ fatally long. One would die of starvation if they weren\u2019t crushed by\
      \ the stampede of famished students first.\r\n\r\nShe raised her hand and waved\
      \ it around. \u201CMrs. Jones? I don\u2019t understand. Why didn\u2019t Fortunato\
      \ realize that Montresor was leading him to his death?\u201D\r\nThe boy quickly\
      \ interrupted with a request to use the restroom, while the stout teacher nodded\
      \ and then returned her attention to her favorite student.\r\n\u201CWell,\u201D\
      \ she began, \u201CTo answer your question, Montresor was baiting him by flattery...\u201D\
      \r\nBut before she got a chance to elaborate, the bell rang once again, this\
      \ time releasing the flood gates as the room was quickly deserted, leaving the\
      \ old woman to try to break through the closed minds of a new batch of students.\r\
      \n\r\n            Once again outside of the heavy teal door to the classroom,\
      \ the boy and girl could see Mrs. Jones inside settling back down to her coffee\
      \ and grading through a tear in the black paper covering the plexiglass window.\
      \ Students swarmed out to lunch, but the girl pushed her glasses up the bridge\
      \ of her nose and shuffled the books in her backpack, not moving as the boy\
      \ shoved a burrito in his mouth. The boy began to speak, his mouth still crowded\
      \ with flour tortilla.\r\n\u201CWell... See, the Valentine\u2019s dance is coming\
      \ up soon, and I was thinking, you know, I only have to pass one more assignment\
      \ in English before I can get off of academic restriction... And, you are really\
      \ good in that class... I mean, you are smart and all, and you\u2019re really\
      \ cute, too... So I was thinking, maybe you could help me pass this essay, and\
      \ then I will be off of probation and then maybe you would want to maybe sort\
      \ of come with me to this dance on Friday?\u201D\r\nStartled, the girl almost\
      \ dropped her books. She cleared her throat and calmly replied, \u201CSure,\
      \ I\u2019d LOVE to,\u201D accidentally letting her emotions through a little\
      \ too much on the \u201Clove\u201D.\r\n\r\n            Outside of room 132 during\
      \ break two days later, the boy leaned against the concrete wall of the building\
      \ and talked with his friends while the girl bent over a sheet of paper, writing\
      \ furiously.  Just as the bell rang, she straightened and triumphantly handed\
      \ the paper over to him. He grabbed it, glanced at it, and shoved it into his\
      \ pack. As he thanked her, the rambunctious voices of the students drowned out\
      \ his gratefulness as they shoved through the small door, which slammed resolutely\
      \ after the boy.\r\n            Once again in their weathered desks, the boy\
      \ and girl sat side by side. She was taking notes diligently, scrawling in messy\
      \ cursive, when her nose began to burn. Turning to the boy, she wrinkled her\
      \ nose.\r\n            \u201CWhat\u2019s that horrible smell?\u201D she asked,\
      \ grimacing. \u201CI took a vial of ammonia from the science lab last period\u201D\
      , he said, grinning.\r\n            \u201CWhy the heck do you want ammonia?\u201D\
      \ she questioned. \u201CI don\u2019t know,\u201D he replied. \u201CWhy not?\u201D\
      \r\nShe smiled, rolling her eyes at his antics. \u201CSo,\u201D she whispered,\
      \ \u201CI\u2019ll meet you at the dance tonight?\u201D\r\n            \u201C\
      The... Right, the dance!\u201D he stammered, \u201CI\u2019ll meet you there.\u201D\
      \r\n\r\n            Standing in line, the girl waited to push past the students\
      \ who still needed to buy their tickets. She clutched hers, a yellow square\
      \ of paper that read \u201CA Kiss From Me to You, ASB Valentine\u2019s Dance.\
      \ $5.\u201D She looked around, searching for her date, hoping he\u2019d be there\
      \ soon so she would feel slightly less awkward in the element not her own. She\
      \ noticed a group of four girls who she knew relatively well and approached\
      \ them, hoping they would accept her into their huddle. She joined them, and\
      \ they walked towards the doors together, chatting nervously. They migrated\
      \ over to a group of guys, and, after waiting for her date to arrive, they decided\
      \ to wait inside where it was slightly warmer. They walked through the gym,\
      \ which was gaudily transformed into a dance floor. They handed their tickets\
      \ to an ASB student, and then passed through the streamers that separated the\
      \ gym from the quad. The crepe paper floated back into place, closing over the\
      \ group as they dissolved into the vibrations of the DJ.\r\n\r\n           \
      \ Three hours later, the gates of the gym opened and the overhead lights flashed\
      \ on. Students rushed out into the chilly night holding balloons stolen from\
      \ the arch in the center of the room, with the flowers that their dates bought\
      \ them tucked behind their ears. The girl and her friends walked out slowly,\
      \ and the light caught on an inky tear as she realized that she and Fortunato\
      \ were both suckers for ammonia and amontillado.\r\n\r\n\r\nRachel\r\nWashington\r\

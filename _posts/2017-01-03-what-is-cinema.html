    body: "I'm a film critic and aspiring filmmaker from Barcelona, so today I want\
      \ to talk about cinema. From my experience, cinema is something that everyone\
      \ is familiar with as a movie goer or spectator, but only a few people really\
      \ know what it IS. I'm serious: it's like there's a big secret hidden behind\
      \ the screen that only real film buffs, students, filmmakers etc... can access,\
      \ and that regular spectators are completely blind to. I'm not talking about\
      \ HOW movies are made (technicalities...), but rather about WHAT they are or\
      \ WHY they are that way. Imagine that your experience of painting or art history\
      \ was that in the Renaissance they liked to paint Christian scenes and the Impressionists\
      \ liked to paint people in the park (so, only stuck to the themes, the stories),\
      \ rather than that the former introduced perspective and achieved perfect harmony\
      \ and the latter introduced a completely different way of thinking about light\
      \ (so, a knowledge related to form, to the essence of art). This is what happens\
      \ with cinema.\r\n\r\nAs a film critic, I try to write about movies from the\
      \ perspective of form, which means trying to understand what decisions the author\
      \ took in terms of framing, composition, color, sound, camera moves, music,\
      \ etc...to make his film more powerful (meaning tell his story better amor convey\
      \ the feelings he's trying to convey more intensely or effectively). If you\
      \ speak to any (good) filmmaker, you'll realize that these kind of questions\
      \ are their main artistic concern, and this proves that here lays the key of\
      \ the art of film. And this is the big secret I was telling you about: everyone\
      \ loves a good movie, but no one (not even cultivated people who may know a\
      \ lot about other arts, be well-read, etc...) pays attention to these questions\
      \ which are the base of the artform, and they tend to disregard them as \"mere\
      \ technical stuff\". It's like saying that the perspective, compositive harmony,\
      \ color use, brush technique, space disposition, etc...of Da Vinci's \"Last\
      \ Supper\" are all mere technicalities, and that the importance of the piece\
      \ lays on the fact that it shows Jesus and his peers having their last supper.\r\
      \n\r\nHow does someone start to discover this secret? Well, the first step is\
      \ probably recognizing that no matter how many movies you've watched, you probably\
      \ know nothing about cinema. The second step would maybe be to watch some of\
      \ the widely considered all time masterpieces of cinema with the humility to\
      \ take for granted that they are masterpieces, and that it is you who has to\
      \ discover or acknowledge why. There's some books you could read, but it's probably\
      \ best to stick to watching better films with better eyes. That's what I did\
      \ at 14 when I started to feel that there was a secret, and it's taken me this\
      \ far.\r\n\r\nIf anyone wants to discuss this, has any thoughts or questions,\
      \ or needs help/recommendations or whatever to get deeper into cinema, please\
      \ don't hesitate to drop me a line :).\r\n\r\nCheers and happy new year (I'm\
      \ writing this on Dec 30) !!!\r\n\r\nMiguel Faus\r\nBarcelona\r\nmiguel.faus1@gmail.com\r\

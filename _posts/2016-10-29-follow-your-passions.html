      t believe I won!\u201D, but statistically speaking, it was bound to happen at\
      \ one point or another. However, it seems like the Listserve knows exactly when\
      \ to drop that email in your lap: when a multitude of other important things\
      \ is also happening!. For example, my girlfriend recently got into a car accident\
      \ (she\u2019s ok) and we are still dealing with those repercussions, my brother\u2019\
      s wedding is this week, I just voluntarily cosigned the first major debt in\
      \ my life and it\u2019s freaking me out, and the vice president of the ham radio\
      \ club that my girlfriend and I belong to just resigned. And at 2 PM today is\
      \ when the Listserve decides to send me an email that says, \u201CYou\u2019\
      ve got 48 hours to address 22,000 people!\u201D I guess it\u2019s a good thing\
      \ that I knew this day would come eventually, and I have put some thought into\
      \ what I might tell you all.\r\n\r\nThe first thing is, ham radio is still alive\
      \ and well. For those of you that have never heard of amateur, or ham, radio,\
      \ I encourage you to find out all that you can. And no, it\u2019s not \u201C\
      just like C.B.\u201D As a twenty nine year old, I am far below the average age\
      \ of licensed hams, and I see no reason why that should be the case. There are\
      \ so many different activities encompassed in ham radio, so there really is\
      \ something for everyone, and so much that I could cover, but I do have a word\
      \ count limit here.\r\n\r\nThere is a thriving maker movement, and hams were\
      \ the original makers. Decades ago it was building from spare parts, and many\
      \ still do today, but now it\u2019s more finding ways to repurpose other items.\
      \ As an example, look up RTL-SDR. It\u2019s a $20 USB stick that originally\
      \ was designed to be used as a TV receiver. Hams found a way to use it as a\
      \ wide coverage receiver that allows listening to a very large chunk of frequencies.\
      \ With it, you can monitor weather satellites, ham radio repeaters, public safety\
      \ frequencies, and yes, even TV broadcasts.\r\n\r\nWe still provide valuable\
      \ communications services in times of emergency. Right now as I type this there\
      \ are emergency communications nets operating in the Hati, Georgia, North Carolina,\
      \ South Carolina, and Florida region helping to pass health and welfare traffic\
      \ to and from areas affected by the hurricane.\r\n\r\nThere are two arguments\
      \ I hear a lot against becoming a ham operator. \u201CWhy would I need to do\
      \ that? I have a cell phone,\u201D and \u201CIsn\u2019t it really expensive?\u201D\
      \ As mentioned above, cell towers can\u2019t be relied upon in emergencies.\
      \ After the storm clears, hams are able to very quickly set up temporary installations\
      \ to pass communications. Beyond that, a cell phone allows you to talk to people\
      \ you already know. Ham radio lets you talk to people you don\u2019t know yet\
      \ from all over the world for as long as you want without needing to pay for\
      \ minutes.\r\n\r\nAs for the cost, any hobby can be expensive if you want it\
      \ to be. It all depends on how much you want to spend, but getting the license\
      \ is a $15 test fee, and you can pick up an entry-level Baofeng radio from Amazon\
      \ for $35 with free shipping. The test is multiple choice, all of the answers\
      \ are published online, and there is plenty of free study material. Even better,\
      \ well established hams tend to upgrade their equipment often, so if you find\
      \ a local club, someone is bound to be able to loan (or even give) you equipment.\
      \ More information can be found at the Amateur Radio Relay League website (look\
      \ for the ARRL on google), or ask me anything via the email below.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019\
      t think that everyone who is licensed is in the technology sector. While the\
      \ majority are in STEM fields, we do have a number of auto mechanics, teachers,\
      \ marketing directors, dog walkers, students, librarians, construction workers,\
      \ and more postal carriers than you can imagine. We come from all walks of life,\
      \ and there\u2019s always someone to talk to about more than just radio.\r\n\
      \r\nI could ham-vangelize for hours (and do on the regular), so I\u2019ll move\
      \ on. The second, and way more important thing, is that ham radio is what I\u2019\
      m passionate about, but everyone should have something that drives them forward\
      \ to better themselves and the community around them. Find something you\u2019\
      re passionate about, and share it with as many people as you can. My best friend\u2019\
      s father took the time to introduce me to ham radio one day, and it changed\
      \ my life in so many ways. It landed me my day job, brought me into a great\
      \ community, and has given my life purpose.\r\n\r\n73,\r\nSam\r\nNorthern CT\

      <p>Part I<br />I had been on the Listserve for two years the first time I won
      the opportunity to share my thoughts with the twenty-two thousand of you. That
      was two years ago. </p>

      <p>In that email, I asked Listservers to pass on opportunities in Latin America
      and China. I received many responses, one of which was from an alumnus of Princeton
      in Latin America, a fellowship program with which I am currently working in
      Argentina. </p>

      <p>Two years ago, the Listserve gave me a platform to reach out to the world.
      Connecting with that first alumni gave me the courage to reach out to a second,
      and the twenty others after that. The Listserve helped bring me back to the
      region that I so dearly love. </p>

      <p>Part Two:<br />Writing to you now, I am in the second half of my fellowship
      in Argentina, working at a non-profit to empower high-impact entrepreneurs.
      While this experience has been a challenge in many ways, I have found so much
      happiness in Buenos Aires--the happiness I couldn''t quite achieve in D.C. Since
      I left, I''ve stopped focusing so much on my destination, and started taking
      time to enjoy the journey. What a difference that has made.</p>

      <p>They say good things come in threes, but twos seem to be more my style. </p>

      <p>Two weeks ago, I was selected to support a think tank on their efforts and
      focus in Argentina.</p>

      <p>Two weeks from now, it will be the Lunar New Year and the year I complete
      two full Chinese zodiac cycles. </p>

      <p>Two days ago, I was notified that I would again have the amazing opportunity

      <p>Though I''m still very much in the midst of part two, I''m sure there will

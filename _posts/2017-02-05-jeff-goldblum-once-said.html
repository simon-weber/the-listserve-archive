      <p>2016 was by far the most tumultuous year of my life. It started with me dropping
      out of college at 20 years old, totaling my car, dodging death by about 10 feet,<br
      />and ended with me moving to Chicago so that I could start my new career as
      a consultant. </p>

      <p>There''s a lot of in between bits there that have contributed massively to
      where I am now that have nothing to do with my own efforts just as much as my
      own efforts do, but I''m not writing some sort of ""how to be successful and
      have connections"" message. </p>

      <p>I''m not qualified to do that. </p>

      <p>At the end of the day I''m a grossly under qualified person, but I think
      everyone secretly is and they''re just hoping they''re doing the right thing
      just as much as I do. </p>

      <p>My apologies to all the actual qualified people out there. </p>

      <p>I just find it really cool that the worst year of my life by almost any metric
      also ended up being the most formative and successful year of my life so far.
      I haven''t even talked to my close friends about any of this. I just wanted
      to share.</p>

      <p>Don''t sell yourself short, always look like you know what you''re doing,
      and don''t take unsolicited advice from morons like me.  </p>

      <p>Good vibes and Happy Trails</p>

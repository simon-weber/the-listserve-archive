<p>As of this week, I have been in LA for 7 months pursuing my dream of becoming a TV writer. Though I work multiple jobs (none of them full-time), I may soon run out of money. Last week, I had an emotional breakdown upon realizing that I may have to give up on my dream (or at least go about it in a different way). I&#8217;m alternating between wanting to throw in the towel, and wanting to push myself just a little bit harder in order to stay out here. Things are definitely a bit tough right now.</p>
<p>But, as I sit here on the floor of my bedroom, stress-eating Chex mix and inhaling caffeine while I complete work for one job before I go to work at another job, I just want to say:</p>
<p>Life is good.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m healthy. I have a loving family and a caring boyfriend. I have a roof over my head and clothes on my back. If I died in a freak snowboarding accident, at least 10 people would miss me.</p>
<p>Whenever people give me advice on my future, they all say something like, &#8220;things will work out in the end!&#8221; or &#8220;your time is almost coming!&#8221; But the thing is, it is just as possible that my time isn&#8217;t coming, and things won&#8217;t work out in the end.</p>
<p>Maybe I never get to do what I wanted to do in my career. I&#8217;ve already been so fortunate in ways that I take for granted every single day, and maybe my career is the one part of my life that won&#8217;t be as I envisioned. I guess we&#8217;ll find out.</p>
<p>Either way, life is good.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! I would love to hear from all of you, especially if you have some awesome life advice (or if you want to offer me a kickass job). No pressure.</p>

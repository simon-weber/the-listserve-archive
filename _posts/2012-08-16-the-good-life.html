      \ way). I\u2019m alternating between wanting to throw in the towel, and wanting\
      \ to push myself just a little bit harder in order to stay out here. Things\
      \ are definitely a bit tough right now.\r\n\r\nBut, as I sit here on the floor\
      \ of my bedroom, stress-eating Chex mix and inhaling caffeine while I complete\
      \ work for one job before I go to work at another job, I just want to say:\r\
      \n\r\nLife is good.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m healthy. I have a loving family and a caring\
      \ boyfriend. I have a roof over my head and clothes on my back. If I died in\

      \ will work out in the end!\u201D or \u201Cyour time is almost coming!\u201D\
      \ But the thing is, it is just as possible that my time isn\u2019t coming, and\

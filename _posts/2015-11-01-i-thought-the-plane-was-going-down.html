    body: "I used to travel a lot for work, but of all those trips, mindlessly staring\
      \ at the stretched fabric of the headrest in front of me, only one flight truly\
      \ stands out. I\u2019ve experienced plenty of turbulence before, but this was\
      \ a whole different level.  The jostling started with random rumbling, and a\
      \ subdued volume of voices from the seats.  Then the drops began, sudden and\
      \ gravity-filled drops that were felt by my spinal cord before my brain. Some\
      \ ancient human ancestor evolved this bundle of spinal nerves that knew emergency\
      \ situations required reflexes, not logical consideration, and now my reflexes\
      \ were taking over my world.  When the pilot began to make purposeful maneuvers,\
      \ we all knew he was attempting to avoid something, be it air pressure, storm\
      \ clouds or whatever they see from those little trapezoid windows up front.\
      \  The cabin had become really quiet now.  The occasional high-pitched yelp\
      \ that escaped a few passengers lips with each drop had made way to silence.\
      \ It was the silence of focus on the sound of the plane and the feel of the\
      \ armrests being squeezed like dumbbells in a curl. We were waiting for the\
      \ next jolt to be our last.\r\n\tBut all this is not what made the flight memorable.\
      \  Over the strained silence, several rows back, the sound of a young child,\
      \ probably about 2 or so came drifting up the cabin.  She was laughing, giggling\
      \ actually.  It was such a startling response to our fate, that I had to turn\
      \ and look to see the child.  I turned and peeked between the rows of upright\
      \ seatbacks to see her mother holding her aloft and making faces as she raised\
      \ and lowered the child with each bump and drop of our flying capsule. The mom\
      \ had turned what was a sufficiently frightening experience for adults into\
      \ a joyride of roller coaster fun for the toddler.  While we were contemplating\
      \ the rest of our life, she was having the time of hers.  The contrast was stark.\r\
      \n\tOur human perspective is malleable.  Our world is literally what we make\
      \ it. Like that mother creating a whole new reality for her child, we can (and\
      \ should) make a reality for ourselves.  So my question to you is \u201CWhat\
      \ is your Preferred Reality?\u201D  How would you imagine or create your own\
      \ relationships, community, society?  If you were to metaphorically hold up\
      \ a toddler and create a new perspective, what would it be?\r\n\tAnswer however\
      \ you will.  Everyone\u2019s answers will be unique to their experience. Personally,\
      \ I am concerned that our rapid pace of technological development is far outstripping\
      \ our human and social development. We can instantly communicate with nearly\
      \ anyone on the globe, but for fear of conflict or embarrassment, I\u2019m reluctant\
      \ to ask my neighbor to quiet his always barking dog.  The social challenges\
      \ seem much more difficult than any technological ones. We\u2019re on the cusp\
      \ of self-driving vehicles and 3-D printers that will be our Star Trek replicators,\
      \ but we still have no solution to all of the ills of hunger, homelessness,\
      \ poverty, and a myriad of societal problems.  My Preferred Reality is one in\
      \ which we value the community and our social interactions, maybe even to a\
      \ greater degree than our jobs and our stuff.  Maybe our tech can lead to incredibly\
      \ rich experiences and intertwined relationships, instead of a more sheltered\
      \ or narrow circle of existence.  Then again, maybe I\u2019m just a dreamer\
      \ who needs to get out more. Maybe I should get on a plane.\r\n\r\n\r\nMatt\r\

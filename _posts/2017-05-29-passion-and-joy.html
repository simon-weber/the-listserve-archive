      \ about something can bring you so much joy. And everyone can be passionate\
      \ about different things, maybe you're into art, cooking, dance, reading, music,\
      \ sports. As long as you have something to be passionate about, you can have\
      \ that joy. And I love hearing about people's passions, even if it's something\
      \ that I don't know anything about. When someone is truly passionate about something\
      \ and feels that joy, that makes me happy as well.\r\n\r\nSo if you want to\
      \ share, I'd love to know what you're passionate about and what brings you joy!\r\

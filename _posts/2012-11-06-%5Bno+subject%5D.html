<p>Ei there.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a Brazilian 21 yr old but my great-grandparents were from Japan - that can impress even those who know me well, given the lack of slanted eyes or a peculiar surname.</p>
<p>I think you should listen to Peter Bjorn & John songs that are NOT "Young Folks".</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working with account planning in an advertising agency for almost 2 years now, and my main freetime hobby lately has been bread-baking. This weekend I plan on baking my first bread made with a natural starter (or levain) I've been working on for the past weeks.</p>
<p>You should also google Inhotim and find out what it is all about.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really into traveling, little into spending lots with it, quite into meeting new people.</p>
<p>So I think you should drop me a line if ever coming to Brazil, and I&#8217;d be very glad if anyone could offer me a couch spot in..say.. Tokyo or Portland anytime ;) (or whichever incredible places you all live at).</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>To me, that&#8217;s the thing about Listserve:</p>
<p>Actually connecting interesting people instead of accumulating versions of &#8220;life-is-short-do-what-you-love" messages that stream from sender to recipients and rarely the other way around. (no offence ;-))</p>
<p>I was quite pleased to read and reply to someone who cooks dinners from all over the world, and amused by the fact that Oxford Comma is not only a song by Vampire Weekend, for example.</p>
<p>Hopeful for connecting,</p>

      \ tag along.\r\nWe have gotten lost on unmarked trails in the North Georgia\
      \ Mountains, had picnics in the rain, gone to a Kangaroo conservatory, a butterfly\

      \ 5 hours to Tybee Island, basked in the sun, had a picnic, toured a Fort and\

      \  We boarded a flight from Atlanta at 5 am, got to New York and hit the ground\
      \ running!  Top of the Empire State Building, Central Park, Times Square, Staten\

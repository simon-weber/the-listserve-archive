<p>Make a difference. Donate a dollar, recycle a bottle, love someone, hold a door open, acknowledge another's achievements, give a hug or an opportunity to someone else.  We are all a part of this world together.  Tonight, look at the moon (something that we all share) and know that someone else is looking at it too, thinking of you and hoping that what she wrote has inspired you to do something positive.</p>

      <p>It''s funny that as soon as you have ambition, other''s success seems like
      an insult. Especially if that other''s success is in the same field in which
      your passion lies.&#160;Maybe that''s not funny.&#160;</p>

      <p>So why am I a failure?&#160;</p>

      <p>It''s not because I''ve tried to be published and failed. It''s not because
      I''ve tried to write for competitions and failed. And (given the fact that I
      make enough money to support myself, live on my own and am generally happy)
      it''s not even that the incredible smallness of my troubles makes me feel so
      terrible.</p>

      <p>And here''s the best part! The best part; I had a great upbringing. I''m
      white and male. I went to great schools and am completely privileged. My biggest
      problem when writing? I have nothing to write about. No foster homes. No financial
      struggles. No, go-to true story of hardship that just rolls onto the page. I
      don''t even have&#160;the moral position to even think of looking for pity from
      strangers because the thing that plagues me is so ridiculously un-pitiable.
      I am an antagonist! i am a bad person for feeling bad about the real and actual
      fortune that has led to this fanciful and gutless misfortune I feel! And I know
      that!</p>

      <p>Isn''t that just f*cking amazing! Ridiculous. I should be the happiest man
      alive. But I''m not.</p>

      <p>So why am I really a failure?&#160;</p>

      <p>Because I know what I have to do to succeed.</p>

      <p>I need to have the balls to leave a comfortable job and take my writing more

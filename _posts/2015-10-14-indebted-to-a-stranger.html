      s all I remember\u2026.\r\n\r\nWhen my eyes opened, the bright hospital lights\
      \ blinded me. The fuzzy scene of my family and friends around me slowly came\
      \ into clarity.  \u201CWhere am I?\u201D I faintly whispered. \u201CYou were\
      \ running and collapsed,\u201D my dad said, gently caressing my hand. Mom didn\u2019\
      t say a word; her countenance dark with worry. \u201CI love to run.\u201D I\
      \ muttered in response, completely unaware. Then it hit me \u2013 my marathon!\
      \ What happened? Why was I here? I was devastated.  Mom handed me my GPS watch\
      \ - 25.9 miles. I had collapsed a quarter mile from the finish line.\r\n\r\n\
      A friend sent this message - \u201CHey, I heard you went loopy at your marathon.\
      \ My friend knows the woman who helped you.\u201D I had no idea anyone had helped\
      \ me! I didn\u2019t even know what had happened and I was anxious to find out.\
      \ I got the phone number for a woman named Paula and gave her a call. I wept\
      \ in awe as she explained the part of the story I couldn\u2019t remember.\r\n\
      \r\nShe had been running the last few miles to support a friend when she saw\
      \ me hobbling slowly along.  She encouraged her friend on and stopped to help\
      \ me. When she approached I clumsily sat down. I told her my name was Ron (not\
      \ my name), and I reached for a crack in the street. \u201CIs this the finish\
      \ line?\u201D I asked.  It was obvious I was delirious and needed medical attention.\
      \ The finish line was in sight so Paula and another man lifted me up, one on\
      \ each side, and escorted me slowly toward the finish. With each step I got\
      \ weaker and weaker until I slumped to the ground. My rescuers carried me to\
      \ the side and yelled for someone to call 911. After propping me up against\
      \ a tree, my eyes rolled to the back of my head and that was the end of my race.\r\
      \n\r\n--\r\n\r\nI owe my life to my Paula. Through her selflessness I escaped\
      \ death that day.  Words are inadequate to express how grateful I am and how\
      \ indebted I feel to her. I was completely and utterly incapable of helping\
      \ myself that day.  That was a very humbling feeling - one I had never really\
      \ felt before, and one I will never forget.\r\n\r\nWhen has someone done something\
      \ for you that you couldn\u2019t do for yourself?\r\nWhen has a friend, loved\
      \ one, or stranger helped you when you needed it?\r\nWho are you grateful for?\
      \ Inspired by? Feel indebted to?\r\nI\u2019d love to hear your stories. Please\
      \ share!\r\n\r\nLife is an incredible journey.\r\nPeople are truly good.\r\n\

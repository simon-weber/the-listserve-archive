      <p>LEGO business? What? How?</p>

      <p>A year ago, I started my venture: The qlib. The qlib is a giant LEGO brick
      that you can just clip onto IKEA furniture. I built those for my study once
      (google &#8222;besta lego shelves&#8220; to check it out) but never thought

      catch on and our manufacturer let us down, so we stopped the campaign before
      it even begun.</p>

      <p>I want my blankie!!</p>

      <p>When you have worked so many nights to get it all done and it doesn&#8217;t
      go as planned, that is exactly the point when you want to go back to your comfort
      zone. You suddenly notice how much time and money you invested and start thinking
      that is was all a bad idea. You start to question everything - the idea, the
      team, the business plan, the marketing strategy, the whole damn project.</p>

      <p>Luckily, I didn&#8217;t do this alone. The whole team pushed me to develop
      plan B with them and we did. That&#8217;s what friends are for. That&#8217;s
      why you shouldn&#8217;t do this alone.</p>

      <p>Will we make a living out of it?</p>

      <p>I would love to end this story with a success, but we&#8217;re not quite
      there yet. We have a new manufacturer, even better prototypes, and we are getting

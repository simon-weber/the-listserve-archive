      <p>I just got the first Listserve email, and it was a little bit too similar
      to what I was originally going to send so I deleted my email and started again.
      I feel as though this is going to turn into a mass swapping of inspirational
      quotes for us to all live our lives by&#8230;but hopefully it will vary more
      as time goes on.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m going to just share some secrets with you instead.</p>

      <p>1.      When no one is watching, I like to dance as if I&#8217;m in a hip
      hop music video.</p>

      <p>2.      I haven&#8217;t washed my hair for four days. Dry shampoo is one
      of my favourite inventions.</p>

      <p>3.      I&#8217;ve always wanted to break my arm or leg. I don&#8217;t want
      to really go through the pain, just ever since I was younger I&#8217;ve been
      jealous of the slings and crutches involved.</p>

      <p>4.      I like Justin Bieber&#8217;s new song&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to
      and it pains me to say it, but I think I do.</p>

      <p>5. I GENUINELY (and irrationally) believe I&#8217;m going to win the jackpot
      on the Euromillions Lottery one day. I know people always have the conversation
      about what they would buy if they won the lottery, speaking hypothetically,
      but in my head I&#8217;m thinking.. &#8220;great idea, you need to remember
      that for when you win&#8221;. Having my email picked from this list just made
      me even more sure of it. Ridiculous, I know.</p>

      <p>Have a lovely day!</p>

<p>Hello Listserve!</p>
<p>I'm just going to let this roll&#8230; I'll share a little and I'd love to learn a bit more about you all.</p>
<p>A bit about me - I have a background in physiology and I love business, people, traveling, photography, medical/science meets business, and relationships/communication. I'm also in the home stretch of an amazing counselling psych program (Clearmind) and I sell my art (They're abstract photos that look more like paintings. You can check them out on flickr "bethhallphotos"). Want to trade a piece of art? Can you recommend any great-to-work-for medical device companies?</p>
<p>My top 5 values:<br />Connection/love<br />Fun/Playfulness<br />Authenticity<br />Growth<br />Creativity</p>
<p>And I'd love to hear from you...<br />Do you love salt water taffy? What do you love about it? Where's the best salt water taffy you've ever had? Do you know where I can get a taffy pulling machine so I can make yards of it for people?</p>
<p>What's the most beautiful place you've ever been to? Obvious or obscure.<br />Most amazing waterfalls?</p>
<p>What's the most meaningful thing you've ever given or received?</p>
<p>What are some of your favourite/beautiful/inspiring movies?</p>
<p>What's your favourite go-to vegetarian or vegan recipe?<br />And the best vegan cake recipe you've come across? (I want to start exploring the vegan world of desserts!)</p>
<p>Where's the most romantic place you've ever been?<br />Most beautiful love story? (Yours or someone you know)</p>
<p>What makes your heart sing?</p>
<p>Random ask:<br />Do you have two shabby chic, contemporary, or reclaimed wood bedside tables you're giving away within 100kms of Vancouver or Seattle? Or a cool, small coffee table (1.5 ft by 3ft -ish) or blocks of wood that would do the trick?</p>
<p>Final thought:<br />When sailing to Bora Bora, we don't get there in straight line. The same goes for life. Let yourself get off course and when you notice you're off, tack back.</p>
<p>Love to you all!</p>

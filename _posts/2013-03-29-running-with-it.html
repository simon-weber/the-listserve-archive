      <p>I''m just going to let this roll&#8230; I''ll share a little and I''d love
      to learn a bit more about you all.</p>

      <p>A bit about me - I have a background in physiology and I love business, people,
      traveling, photography, medical/science meets business, and relationships/communication.
      I''m also in the home stretch of an amazing counselling psych program (Clearmind)
      and I sell my art (They''re abstract photos that look more like paintings. You
      can check them out on flickr "bethhallphotos"). Want to trade a piece of art?
      Can you recommend any great-to-work-for medical device companies?</p>

      <p>My top 5 values:<br />Connection/love<br />Fun/Playfulness<br />Authenticity<br
      />Growth<br />Creativity</p>

      <p>And I''d love to hear from you...<br />Do you love salt water taffy? What
      do you love about it? Where''s the best salt water taffy you''ve ever had? Do
      you know where I can get a taffy pulling machine so I can make yards of it for
      people?</p>

      <p>What''s the most beautiful place you''ve ever been to? Obvious or obscure.<br
      />Most amazing waterfalls?</p>

      <p>What''s the most meaningful thing you''ve ever given or received?</p>

      <p>What are some of your favourite/beautiful/inspiring movies?</p>

      <p>What''s your favourite go-to vegetarian or vegan recipe?<br />And the best
      vegan cake recipe you''ve come across? (I want to start exploring the vegan
      world of desserts!)</p>

      <p>Where''s the most romantic place you''ve ever been?<br />Most beautiful love
      story? (Yours or someone you know)</p>

      <p>What makes your heart sing?</p>

      <p>Random ask:<br />Do you have two shabby chic, contemporary, or reclaimed
      wood bedside tables you''re giving away within 100kms of Vancouver or Seattle?
      Or a cool, small coffee table (1.5 ft by 3ft -ish) or blocks of wood that would
      do the trick?</p>

      <p>Final thought:<br />When sailing to Bora Bora, we don''t get there in straight
      line. The same goes for life. Let yourself get off course and when you notice
      you''re off, tack back.</p>

      <p>Love to you all!</p>

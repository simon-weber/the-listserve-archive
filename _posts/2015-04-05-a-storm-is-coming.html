      <p>My favorite Listserve stories are those where people share insights<br />into

      now I''m sitting on a couch in Baton Rouge. I''m<br />collaborating with scientists
      from LSU (hey there!) on a project to<br />improve the fidelity of storm surge
      prediction. Not complicated at<br />all. Do you remember hurricane Katrina?</p>

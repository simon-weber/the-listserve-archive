      Here''s his message:</p>

      <p>***</p>

      <p>What is the purpose of everything?</p>

      <p>How did we get here?</p>

      <p>"What is the meaning of Life?"</p>

      <p>You might be amazed to learn, that Islam is providing clear and concise answers
      for these questions. Have you heard about &#8220;The Stanford Prison Experiment&#8221;?
      Or maybe you&#8217;ve seen the movie &#8220;The Experiment&#8221;? . Zimbardo
      is a famous psychologist who used to teach at Stanford University, and made
      this experiment. Twenty-four males were part of it; twelve were assigned the
      roles of &#8220;prisoners&#8221; and the other twelve were assigned the roles
      of &#8220;guards&#8221;. A mock prison was created.</p>

      <p>Each person had to play their role for two weeks. However, the experiment
      had to stop after six days as a result of what happened. The participants got
      too involved in their roles, that it had become more to them than just an experiment.
      The guards who were given ultimate power and wooden batons became extremely
      violent and tortured the prisoners. The prisoners on the other hand suffered
      from depression and humiliation as a result of the guards&#8217; acts.</p>

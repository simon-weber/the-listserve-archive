      <p>Basically, I think getting married is a pretty silly thing to do, whether
      you''re gay or straight. Historically speaking, marriage was a contract designed
      to pass ownership of a woman on from her father to her new husband (hence, her
      name changes from her father''s to her husband''s). But, if that isn''t enough

      <p>For example, in most Western countries, social security rights are determined
      according to a ''breadwinner'' system, where one member of the family is considered
      to be the ''head'' and the others are awarded their rights according to their
      relationship to him. I say ''him'' because, historically, only men have been

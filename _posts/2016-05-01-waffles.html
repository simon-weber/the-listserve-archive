    body: '<p>Howdy!</p>

      <p>All of my favorite emails on here have been fiction or easy recipes, and
      though I''m a better reader than writer, I''ve got both a recipe and a story!</p>

      <p>Story first:<br />I have a wonderful older sister, who when she went away
      to college, told me that in the dining hall, you could get a waffle with the
      school logo on it.</p>

      <p>I wanted one. But when I went to (a different) college, I couldn''t get a
      college-themed waffle. I felt deprived and sad. It''s silly, but I thought it
      was a great idea, and I wanted one so badly!</p>

      <p>During sophomore year, I started wondering how hard could it really be to
      get one made?</p>

      <p>I was pretty much all talk though, until about a year after graduation.</p>

      <p>At that point, I decided enough talk, I was going to get my waffle iron!</p>

      <p>It took two years, but it''s happened! Ironically, due to the way licensing
      for colleges work, I still don''t have my dream waffle iron.</p>

      <p>But I''m closer. I''ve learned to negotiate, cold call, hire artists and
      deal with shipping containers full of waffle irons, as well as taste-test waffle
      recipes (the hardest job by far)! Though I will admit, it''s a little hard to
      explain to people exactly what it is that I do for work.</p>

      <p>There have been days that I''m swimming in syrup, but I''m licensed to sell
      college logo waffle irons for the University of Miami, Florida State University
      and the University of Florida. I''m in some stores, and hope to get into more.</p>

      <p>You can find my company at tsquaredwaffles, hoping to bring the love of your
      college to the breakfast table. It''s my baby and I hope to expand, and maybe
      add your school! (And certainly add mine.) I''m proud of what I did, but most
      of all, I''m happier to do it then what I had originally thought I''d do when
      I was in school.</p>

      <p>As I mentioned, I have made a lot of waffles over the past two years and
      this is my family''s go-to recipe for waffles- (yield 3-ish waffles-it''s machine
      dependent) Can also be used for pancakes, or according to one uncle, for fried
      chicken.</p>

      <p>Classic Waffle Batter<br />&#189; cup of Milk<br />1 cup of Flour<br />&#188;
      tsp Baking Soda<br />&#188; tsp Salt<br />&#190; cup Sugar<br />1 Egg<br />Can

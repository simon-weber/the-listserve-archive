      \ a show in St Louis yesterday; today's an off-day and I'm visiting family before\
      \ heading to Chicago for a show tomorrow.\r\n\r\nI never planned to be a musician.\
      \ I studied creative writing and literature, and expected to become a teacher\
      \ or a writer. Yet somehow in the last 13 years, I've released 10 albums and\
      \ have played 1200+ shows in the US and abroad without the help of management\
      \ or a record label (but backed by amazing fans).\r\n\r\nIn part, the decision\
      \ to play music professionally was born not only out of my love for writing\
      \ and performing songs, but also out of my love for travel and my desire to\
      \ see new places and meet new people (oddly, or maybe not, it was all started\
      \ via a study abroad program 16 years ago - thank you Santa Chiara). It's been\
      \ an incredible way to make friends and do things I never expected I'd do. To\
      \ finance tours, studio time, and record production, I've worked a *very* random\
      \ assortment of jobs over the years (not to mention played hundreds of shows\
      \ and driven hundreds of thousands of miles). I've learned to be patient and\
      \ flexible. Thanks to my supportive fans, I'm grateful to say that I've been\
      \ able to finance each album through pre-orders (long before such a thing as\
      \ Kickstarter existed) and I've never been in debt in order to keep it going.\
      \ My profit has been life experience, and the opportunity to continue making\
      \ albums.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like a free digital download of my latest record,\
      \ or just want to chat about music or books, send me an email.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\
      I always thought that my Listserve email would be about all the amazing and\
      \ difficult changes in the music industry over the last decade. I have *loads*\
      \ to say on that topic. But shortly after I received the \"you've won!\" email,\
      \ something else happened that gave me pause and reminded me of how grateful\
      \ I am to just be alive and here with people I love.\r\nAs I mentioned above,\
      \ I'm in St Louis visiting family. On the first afternoon we were here, I was\
      \ taking a nap when I heard sirens just outside. The siren stopped, and I started\
      \ to fall back asleep. But then another one came, and another. I heard footsteps\
      \ from the living room as everyone headed outside, so I finally got up to see\
      \ what was going on.\r\n\r\nThe next door neighbor had suffered a massive heart\
      \ attack. He called the paramedics himself, but they weren't able to save him.\
      \ He was a respected actor in local theater, and his name was Barry. He was\
      \ only 50 years old. An hour before, he was just mowing his lawn like millions\
      \ of other guys on a sunny Saturday on Memorial Day weekend. He had just begun\
      \ to clean out his basement when he had chest pains.\r\n\r\nMy sister lives\
      \ in a small, quiet cul de sac, where most of the neighbors know each other\
      \ at least by sight, and yet many of them only met each other in person for\
      \ the first time that afternoon, standing on the street outside Barry's house\
      \ while the paramedics worked inside. It was a sobering reminder of how brief\
      \ all of this is, and how easy it is to forget to reach out to those around\
      \ us. The obituary in the local paper closed with a friend of his saying, \u201C\
      But he was so loved. I hope he knew that. I just wish I had one more chance\
      \ to tell him.\u201D\r\n\r\nTell your dear ones that they are loved. Don't wait.\r\

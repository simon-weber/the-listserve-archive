      \ understand how important it is that you read her story, unless you actually\
      \ read it. But it's a story that desperately needs to be known. \r\n\r\nIf I\
      \ could just show you a picture of her, you'd peer closer at your screen and\
      \ you'd take notice. You'd ask me questions. You'd ask me \"why?\" and \"what\
      \ happened?\". But now it's my responsibility to show you Amy through words.\
      \ \r\n\r\nThis is what happened.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1987 a little girl\
      \ was born an only child to doting parents. Amy May grew to become a kind-hearted\
      \ young woman with a huge love of animals, a wicked sense of humour and the\
      \ biggest belly laugh you'd ever hear. She went on to study Journalism at university,\
      \ making many friends along the way, and began a successful career in London\
      \ working behind the scenes in television - though she was so glamourous-looking\
      \ you'd say she belonged in front of the cameras.\r\n\r\nIn April 2014, when\
      \ Amy was 26, she went to Budapest for the weekend with some friends. One night\
      \ they went out for dinner and she ordered Mediterranean chicken with rice.\
      \ Doesn't sound that remarkable, right? However, taking just one bite of that\
      \ dish completely devastated her life. Why? Her nut allergy wasn't taken seriously.\r\
      \n\r\nDon't get me wrong - no one took Amy's allergy more seriously than Amy.\
      \ Everywhere she went she carried epi pens and medical cards in every language\
      \ to show restaurant staff. Unfortunately this one waiter assured her that her\
      \ food was completely nut-free, although it wasn't. Within minutes of eating\
      \ a mouthful, Amy's throat quickly swelled up, despite her administering two\
      \ epi pens. Her brain deprived of oxygen for six minutes, she went into cardiac\
      \ arrest on the pavement outside the restaurant shortly after. What followed\
      \ was a three-week induced coma to decrease brain swelling, months in an intensive\
      \ care unit, countless infections, a collapsed lung and three bouts of septicaemia.\r\
      \n\r\nAlmost two years later my beautiful friend is in a wheelchair, unable\
      \ to walk or talk. She lives in a care home where she is fed through a tube\
      \ and is unable to wash herself. \r\n\r\nThat single bite of food caused Amy\
      \ May to become severely brain damaged. And enclosed inside her helpless body\
      \ with its fragile limbs and twisted hands is complete awareness. She remembers\
      \ everything and understands exactly what has happened to her. After she woke\
      \ up, it took around a year for her to stop crying every day.\r\n\r\nYet Amy's\
      \ story hasn't ended yet - it's ongoing because she is one determined young\
      \ lady. In 23 months she's gone from being virtually vegetative to laughing,\
      \ swallowing, communicating and having a number of therapies to help get the\
      \ old Amy back. I'm so proud of her.\r\n\r\nAmy May Shead. To you, her name\
      \ is unfamiliar - but to me and so many others it's a mantra of true bravery\
      \ and resilience.\r\n\r\nSo, that's Amy May's story. Why it needs to be known\
      \ is simple. People have to understand that allergies ARE serious. It's not\
      \ always a fad. Flippancy could literally kill someone, or ruin their life as\
      \ they know it. \r\n\r\nPlease pass on the message.\r\n\r\nIt's fitting that\
      \ I won the Listserve the day after I ran my first ever half marathon - training\
      \ for next month's London Marathon, which I'm running for The Amy May Trust.\

      <p>This is what happened.</p>

      <p>In the autumn of 1987 a little girl was born an only child to doting parents.
      Amy May grew to become a kind-hearted young woman with a huge love of animals,
      a wicked sense of humour and the biggest belly laugh you''d ever hear. She went

      <p>Don''t get me wrong - no one took Amy''s allergy more seriously than Amy.

      <p>Almost two years later my beautiful friend is in a wheelchair, unable to

      \ act of ongoing imagination,\u201D writes Michael Dorris. \u201CWhen we're\
      \ home, we don't pine to be anywhere else, we don't feel out of place or a stranger.\u201D\
      \ We pined to be somewhere else very much.\r\n\r\nTravel brought me, a Slovak,\
      \ and her, an Californian, together in the Netherlands ten years prior; we decided\
      \ home was anywhere we were together. As we watched our house sell, our budget\
      \ tighten, and our belongings dwindle, tongues in cheek we also decided that\
      \ the only object we absolutely needed on our travels, aside from clothes, money,\
      \ and passports, was a toothbrush. And so we concluded: Home is where your toothbrush\
      \ is.\r\n\r\nFlipping Thoreau's exhortation to live at home like a traveler\
      \ on its head, we set out to live in the world like at home. Wherever we went,\
      \ we made a point of visiting temples, cemeteries, and markets. We ate street\
      \ food and at restaurants, went to museums and corner shops, strolled the streets\
      \ of villages and cities, hiked through forests and parks, rode public transportation.\
      \ Everywhere could be home if we felt it was home.\r\n\r\nOf course, it's not\
      \ that simple. Sometimes I'd wake up and spend an eternity figuring out where\
      \ I was. No wonder: in the 13 months of traveling I slept in 73 different beds.\
      \ But because I am my only constant, wherever and whenever I was my habits and\
      \ routines and rituals were always with me\u2014they're what makes a place familiar\
      \ and safe. Visiting the same kinds of places in every destination became a\
      \ routine in and of itself. Repetition breeds familiarity, which, in turn, generates\
      \ a sense of being at home.\r\n\r\nOnce you leave the original home, you make\
      \ every home yourself. A location begins to feel like place and eventually like\
      \ home when it acquires substance: the mass of memories. Where routines lay\
      \ the foundation of home by creating a sense of regularity and comfort, memories\
      \ build home up into a distinct place on your mental world map. Like every traveler\
      \ I have a million stories from the road, which stitch together quilts of memories\
      \ that I associate with each place. Those memories are the place. If an effect\
      \ of travel is to create memories, you can be home anywhere, even on the road\
      \ itself.\r\n\r\nWhen place becomes a part of you, it turns into home. The distinction\
      \ between where you live and who you are becomes blurred; if, as Robert Frost\
      \ predicted, the day ever comes who you are, you may know better where you are.\

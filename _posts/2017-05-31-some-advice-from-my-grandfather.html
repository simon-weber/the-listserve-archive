      \ my grandfather came to visit from Orissa (now called Odisha), an eastern coast\

      \ to the local  farmer's market.  I did.  As we walked past the numerous booths\
      \ selling fruits, vegetables, cheeses, baked goods and fresh jams, we came upon\
      \ one that was selling venison jerky.  My grandfather paused in front of it.\
      \  He asked me if I had ever tried venison before.  I said no, I had not.  We\
      \ asked for a sample, and as we chewed on the rather tough, gamey piece of meat,\
      \ I asked him what he thought.  He said, it was okay, but not as good as the\
      \ last time he had eaten venison.  I asked him when that was. \r\n\r\nIt was\
      \ some time in the 1930s, in a small rural village in Orissa.  My grandfather\
      \ had just turned 18.  His mother had died earlier that year, and his father\
      \ had passed away two years previous.  He had been planning to go to university\
      \ to study agriculture, but now he struggled with the decision; he had young\
      \ siblings at home that needed him to work and care for them.  Like almost everyone\
      \ he knew in his village, they had very little money and rarely enough to eat.\
      \ \r\n\r\nOne afternoon, he was working in a local field, farming.  On the outskirts\
      \ of the field, he heard a commotion.  Sickle in hand, he rushed toward it,\
      \ and saw that a group of villagers had crowded, forming a loose circle around\
      \ something.  He made his way into the inner part of the circle and saw what\
      \ had caused them to gather: it was a massive Indian python snake, maybe seven\
      \ or eight feet in length, and in its jaws, being partially digested, was a\
      \ deer.  The outline of the deer's front end could be seen in the body of the\
      \ snake.  Thankfully, it appeared the deer was already dead, no longer struggling.\
      \ \r\n\r\nWithout really thinking, my grandfather swung his sickle at the head\
      \ of the python, making contact.  Looking stunned, but obviously preoccupied,\
      \ the python moved only slightly toward him.  Drawing back his arm with the\
      \ sickle, he swung again, this time hooking the sharp blade firmly into the\
      \ side of the python's mouth, the same way you would a fish with a hook.  With\
      \ great effort, and with the assistance of a few equally brave neighbors, he\
      \ began to slice open the python lengthwise.  Soon, the python was dead, and\
      \ the deer was extracted from its insides.  That night, those in the small village\
      \ celebrated my grandfather's quick thinking and dined on fire roasted venison.\

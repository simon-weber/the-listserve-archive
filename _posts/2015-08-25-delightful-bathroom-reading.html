      <p>----</p>

      <p>Our culture has become inextricably tied to images as a means of communication.
      You know the apps. Some say this has been a bad thing&#8230; selfies, emojis
      and memes carpet bomb societal intelligence and promote narcissism.</p>

      <p>There&#8217;s a bright side though. Instagram provides a platform for photographers
      to display their work with appreciative folks around the world. Facebook keeps
      me in touch with my (ridiculous) parents across the country. Snapchat shows
      me what people are doing in places I&#8217;ve never been AND which of my friends
      are on the toilet.</p>

      <p>A great photo can tell a story well beyond its frame. Who took it? What were/weren&#8217;t
      you wearing? Was a security guard about to tackle you? Who were you with? Were
      you in love or falling out of it?</p>

      <p>Email me a favorite photo you&#8217;ve taken along with the story behind
      it.</p>

      <p>Maybe I&#8217;ll make a cool page of your submissions! Or maybe I&#8217;ll
      just respond with unsolicited, unqualified artistic criticism?</p>

      <p>Photogs to follow:<br />@littlecoal - incredible pics of my birthplace, Northwest
      Ohio<br />@kdkuiper - aerial pics and drone videos of my current location, San
      Diego<br />@connorxmartin - B&amp;W scenes of the urban landscape of Toledo
      and its big brother, Detroit</p>

      <p>---</p>

      <p>Scattered thoughts<br />If you&#8217;re too young/poor to invest substantial
      money (like me), learn how to invest time wisely.</p>

      <p>Subtlety is an important storytelling device. Let the audience read between
      the lines every once in a while; you don&#8217;t have to spoon feed them everything.
      This goes for every form of art as well as lesser things like dating.</p>

      <p>Tom Brady is lying about Deflategate and we all know it.</p>

      <p>Presidential debates are incredibly bizarre. A bunch of white males covered
      in makeup delivering painstakingly rehearsed, focus-group-tested lines. In what
      other setting would this be normal? Don&#8217;t say my family reunion.</p>

      <p>As far as media content goes, we drive the bus. As a recent Listserve post
      said, stop clicking on Justin Bieber and they&#8217;ll stop stuffing it down
      our throats wrapped in clickbait.</p>

      <p>Never forget where you came from. I&#8217;ve lived in 4 U.S. states now and

      <p>It&#8217;s funny to see how the media reacts to dating apps like Tinder.
      &#8220;The End of Chivalry!&#8221; &#8220;A Cheater&#8217;s Favorite App!&#8221;
      Unchivalrous guys are unchivalrous; it doesn&#8217;t take an app to bring that
      out of someone. Similarly, those who stray for greener pastures would have done
      it with or without an app. &#8220;Honey, I would&#8217;ve been faithful, but
      Nina was just 0.2 miles away and we had impeccable banter!&#8221;</p>

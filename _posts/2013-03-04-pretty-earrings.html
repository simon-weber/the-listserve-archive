<p>I like details.Sometimes I wish I could take pictures whenever I blink my eyes. To save that detail for later.</p>
<p>When I'm waiting for the bus or in the middle of a crowd, I imagine the lives of the people around me: that woman is wondering what she'll cook for dinner for her husband, mom and 2 and 4-year-old kids. Oh. She has pretty earrings. That boy has a small birth mark on his left cheek and wishes he could get a new pair of sneakers for his birthday. That sweet old lady is looking at me and wants to talk. I say hi and smile. She smiles back and 10 minutes later I know all about her family.</p>
<p>If I get nervous or need to gather my thoughts, I do origami. Focusing on the way I need to fold the paper is relaxing.</p>
<p>I inhale deeply after someone passes by me in the street. Besides perfume, people have their own smell and it's as unique as a fingerprint (but not always pleasant).</p>
<p>Going for a run under pouring rain and against strong wind makes me feel powerful. "If we can face this, we can face everything in life". That's what my mom says.</p>
<p>Sometimes I talk to myself in french because&#8230;erm&#8230;I feel like it.</p>
<p>Right now I'm going to watch this week's video lectures from my "Astrobiology and the Search for Extraterrestrial Life" online course on Coursera. I'll be a doctor in 2 years but need to run away from the medicine bubble every once in a while.</p>
<p>Wish you all a bright day.</p>

    \ with the illness since I was 19 years old. It was only when I walked onto a\
    \ beige tile floor in a pair of hospital socks to a room full of doctors that\
    \ I was told the diagnosis. I had a bipolar episode and was admitted to a mental\
    \ unit in the city public hospital. I always knew something was wrong, and although\
    \ no one wants to hear they\u2019re bipolar, it was a relief to hear an answer\
    \ to all the pain I had been dealing with.\r\n\r\nAfter I was released from the\
    \ hospital, I didn\u2019t know how I would pick up the pieces to my life again.\
    \ This being my fifth or sixth episode, I already knew how hard it would be. I\
    \ moved out of the house I bought, into my parents\u2019 home. My ex-girlfriend,\
    \ who I put through years of hell, was gone - her and the dog. How could I blame\
    \ her, someone who had to deal with someone like me - someone with bipolar - every\
    \ day to not leave me after all those years of craziness? Alienating the ones\
    \ you love is always those most painful part of being bipolar. The aftermath is\
    \ worse.\r\n\r\nSo what exactly is bipolar? It\u2019s different for everyone,\
    \ but from my experience and what I\u2019ve been told, it\u2019s a mental illness\
    \ that causes periods of emotional up\u2019s and down\u2019s, manic states \u2013\
    \ euphoric highs and an out of control state-of-mind - depressive states, uncontrollable\
    \ actions, and a ton of other ill-fated effects. Coincidentally, those with bipolar\
    \ have a hard time keeping jobs and relationships, among many other things. Sounds\
    \ like it could ruin anyone\u2019s life, doesn\u2019t it?\r\n\r\nBut you learn\
    \ how to manage the best you can as you go along with the right help and love.\
    \ You\u2019ll constantly have to apologize and clean up all the messes you make\
    \ when you\u2019re bipolar. I\u2019ve done it many times since diagnosis. I\u2019\
    ve even lost another person that I dearly love. You\u2019ll feel comfortable enough\
    \ to decide it\u2019s okay to stop taking your medication and/or see your doctors\
    \ when you\u2019re bipolar. I\u2019ve also done this. Again. And you\u2019ll go\
    \ to hell and back and back again when you\u2019re bipolar.\r\n\r\nThis is my\
    \ chance to bring awareness to the mental illness that is bipolar. To bring it\
    \ to light, so those that don\u2019t know about the struggles of someone with\
    \ bipolar will understand them with compassion, patience, and most importantly\
    \ love. It takes a sincerely loving person to become a bipolar\u2019s person loving\
    \ martyr and partner. And they exist. I would know.\r\n\r\nThank you, and I\u2019\
    m sorry.\r\n\r\n\r\nNando Casinelli\t\r\nnando.casinelli@gmail.com\t\r\nConnecticut\r\

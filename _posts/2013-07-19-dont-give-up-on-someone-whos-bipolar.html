<p>I wasn&#8217;t as excited as I thought I would be when I received the email from the Listserve that I had won the lottery to send out a story to thousands of people. I thought about it. I took an hour lunch break away from my cube, made a phone call and took a quick car ride around the block before I realized this was a chance to become another spokesperson in a drowned-out pool of mentally ill awareness advocates. But there can never be enough champions for the mentally ill.</p>
<p>I, myself, am bipolar. I was diagnosed two years ago after living with the illness since I was 19 years old. It was only when I walked onto a beige tile floor in a pair of hospital socks to a room full of doctors that I was told the diagnosis. I had a bipolar episode and was admitted to a mental unit in the city public hospital. I always knew something was wrong, and although no one wants to hear they&#8217;re bipolar, it was a relief to hear an answer to all the pain I had been dealing with.</p>
<p>After I was released from the hospital, I didn&#8217;t know how I would pick up the pieces to my life again. This being my fifth or sixth episode, I already knew how hard it would be. I moved out of the house I bought, into my parents&#8217; home. My ex-girlfriend, who I put through years of hell, was gone - her and the dog. How could I blame her, someone who had to deal with someone like me - someone with bipolar - every day to not leave me after all those years of craziness? Alienating the ones you love is always those most painful part of being bipolar. The aftermath is worse.</p>
<p>So what exactly is bipolar? It&#8217;s different for everyone, but from my experience and what I&#8217;ve been told, it&#8217;s a mental illness that causes periods of emotional up&#8217;s and down&#8217;s, manic states &#8211; euphoric highs and an out of control state-of-mind - depressive states, uncontrollable actions, and a ton of other ill-fated effects. Coincidentally, those with bipolar have a hard time keeping jobs and relationships, among many other things. Sounds like it could ruin anyone&#8217;s life, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>But you learn how to manage the best you can as you go along with the right help and love. You&#8217;ll constantly have to apologize and clean up all the messes you make when you&#8217;re bipolar. I&#8217;ve done it many times since diagnosis. I&#8217;ve even lost another person that I dearly love. You&#8217;ll feel comfortable enough to decide it&#8217;s okay to stop taking your medication and/or see your doctors when you&#8217;re bipolar. I&#8217;ve also done this. Again. And you&#8217;ll go to hell and back and back again when you&#8217;re bipolar.</p>
<p>This is my chance to bring awareness to the mental illness that is bipolar. To bring it to light, so those that don&#8217;t know about the struggles of someone with bipolar will understand them with compassion, patience, and most importantly love. It takes a sincerely loving person to become a bipolar&#8217;s person loving martyr and partner. And they exist. I would know.</p>
<p>Thank you, and I&#8217;m sorry.</p>

      <p>A Framework:</p>

      <p>Let&#8217;s retool the machinery for indoctrinating our kids.  Let&#8217;s
      change the payload of mythic stories and fear and replace it with knowledge
      and wonder. You can set aside an hour a week to discuss great ideas and explanations

      learn in small groups in people&#8217;s homes. Let&#8217;s put wow into the
      pursuit of answers. Let&#8217;s wonder.</p>

      <p>A Spark:</p>

      <p>It&#8217;s hard to deny the grandeur of the universe when you look at the
      night sky or see a bee&#8217;s wing under the microscope. We all react to that.
      Call it God, call it Nature, call it the Universe, we all feel it. Let&#8217;s
      use that as a jumping-off point and carry that ember with us, nurturing it,
      poking at its edges, learning. Let&#8217;s stoke it and warm to its flame every
      week with our friends.</p>

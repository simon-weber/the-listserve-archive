      \ was to be boiled down to a single person we would be a 34-year-old living\
      \ 3475km (2159 miles) from where we grew up. For perspective, that's roughly\
      \ Vancouver to Ottawa, London to Beirut or Mumbai to Kuala Lumpur. And over\
      \ half of our Facebook community (55.84%) would live more than a day-trip distance\

      \ so I think we have an accurate composite of who the Listserve serves. But,\
      \ I figured our data would be skewed by those of us in our twenties who have\

      \nThe only dip occurs for those over 60, and I imagine that is not due to travel\

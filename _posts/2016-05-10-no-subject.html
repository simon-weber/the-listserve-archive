    body: "Hi,\r\nMy name is Eric Mauka from Kenya, 31 years old and looking forward\
      \ to many more years ahead. I grew up in upcountry and came to the city when\
      \ attending my college, I was so scared of the freedom, the exposure, the new\
      \ environment and people I met. (I was scared because I had interacted with\
      \ old men in their 70's  and some would open up and share their experience in\
      \ life, what they achieved and what they regret to date). I came to realize\
      \ the out come of their life was because of the simple daily decisions they\
      \ made while they were young.\r\n\r\nBecause of this, I decided to look for\
      \ a Mentor, who will guide and advice me in my Teenage life, it's now 10 years\
      \ and he has not only been a mentor in my teenage life but also in my relationships,\
      \ investments and major decisions that I make. I desire to be a good person\
      \ who will make a difference in the Society at Large, to give hope, encourage\
      \ others, to give a helping hand and that's just me.\r\n\r\nerick.mauka@gmail.com\

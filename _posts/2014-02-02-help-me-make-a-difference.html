      \ relatives in my generation have sloughed off the dysfunctional aspects of\
      \ life in which we were raised.  Me? Racism is non-existent in my heart and\

      \ has shown me that hope, like enthusiasm, is sticky. So I touch everyone and\

      \ 2014 where my goal now is not merely to teach and foster a love of literature\
      \ and language, but to make a difference in a community where poverty robs kids\
      \ of their dreams and gunfire is what happens outside, so most kids don\u2019\

<p>I'm a 25 year old with too many life lessons under my belt. The biggest things I want to share with you are these:</p>
<p>1. Learn how to drive, and use that knowledge. Like using blinkers, and moving over when you're going slower than the general speed of traffic. Also use common courtesy. I can't stress that last part enough.</p>
<p>2. Quit using listserve for your religious purposes. Its not cool to force your beliefs on others. But I guess why else would you email thousands of people to get your message out?</p>
<p>3.  On dating, if you feel like your significant other is the best thing in your life, treat them as such. Don't let them slip through your fingers.</p>
<p>4. Get a pet. Doesn't matter what kind. I have a couple of cats and they are awesome. One plays fetch, and the other is horribly mean to anybody but me. I know it sounds strange to keep a mean cat, but she's old and cute and she likes me.</p>
<p>5. Its not too late to "fix" your life. Go back to school, learn something new or a hobby. </p>
<p>6. Go out on a limb and do something out of the ordinary. Live outside the box. My new years resolution (two years running) have been to try something new every month and see a show or go to an event every month as well. I've been completely successful with that.</p>
<p>Just live life. Same thing more better.</p>

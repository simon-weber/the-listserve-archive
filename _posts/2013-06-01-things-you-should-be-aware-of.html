    The biggest things I want to share with you are these:</p>

    <p>1. Learn how to drive, and use that knowledge. Like using blinkers, and moving
    over when you''re going slower than the general speed of traffic. Also use common
    courtesy. I can''t stress that last part enough.</p>

    <p>2. Quit using listserve for your religious purposes. Its not cool to force
    your beliefs on others. But I guess why else would you email thousands of people
    to get your message out?</p>

    <p>3.  On dating, if you feel like your significant other is the best thing in
    your life, treat them as such. Don''t let them slip through your fingers.</p>

    <p>4. Get a pet. Doesn''t matter what kind. I have a couple of cats and they are
    awesome. One plays fetch, and the other is horribly mean to anybody but me. I
    know it sounds strange to keep a mean cat, but she''s old and cute and she likes
    me.</p>

    <p>5. Its not too late to "fix" your life. Go back to school, learn something
    new or a hobby. </p>

    <p>6. Go out on a limb and do something out of the ordinary. Live outside the
    box. My new years resolution (two years running) have been to try something new
    every month and see a show or go to an event every month as well. I''ve been completely
    successful with that.</p>

    <p>Just live life. Same thing more better.</p>

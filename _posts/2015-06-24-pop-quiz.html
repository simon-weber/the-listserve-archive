      \ nature photographer David Slater had his camera swiped by a (critically endangered)\
      \ crested black macaque. Before Slater recovered it, the macaque took some photos\

      \ studies hard. Thinking about the content and assessment, what mark do you\
      \ predict she would get, and why? [5]\r\n\r\n9. Imagine that humans suddenly\
      \ develop a new sense, the ability to detect the age of an object or organism\
      \ by touch. It is first detected in a seamstress who can reliably tell apart\
      \ vintage silk dresses and modern replicas made with new silk fabric although\
      \ they seem to be identical in appearance, materials and construction. Many\
      \ or most other humans develop this sense, and are able to sort almost everything\u2014\
      carrots, cars, castles and cats\u2014by age. Imagine that you are pioneering\

      \ seems to have four types (fast- and slow-adapting, with large or small receptive\
      \ fields). What type(s) of stimuli do you hypothesize would have the strongest\
      \ effect on each age-o-tron, and why? [8]\r\n\r\nFINALLY, AS ON EVERY TEST I\

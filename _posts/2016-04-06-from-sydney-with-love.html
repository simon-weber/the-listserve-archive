      \ us,\u201D Johannes said.\r\n\r\nAnd so here we go.\r\n\r\nI met Johannes,\
      \ Gui, Woonie and Jim and the advertising agency we worked together at in Auckland.\r\
      \n\r\nOn my first day of work, I was taken on a tour of the office. When we\
      \ went by Jimbo and Woonie\u2019s desks, the two of them were watching a surfing\
      \ video. I asked the person giving me a tour to leave me there, and within two\
      \ weeks we were out surfing the coasts of New Zealand together.\r\n\r\nA month\
      \ or so later, Gui and Johannes started working at our agency, and they joined\
      \ us for surf missions.\r\n\r\nAt first, I think it was a friendship of convenience\
      \ and sympathy: I didn\u2019t have a car at the time, and the other guys saw\
      \ how badly I wanted to make it out to coast to surf so they gave me a ride.\r\
      \n\r\nBut you can only spend so many long car rides down twisty, New Zealand\
      \ roads and so much time braving the icy New Zealand water with people before\
      \ they became more than just work colleagues.\r\n\r\nSome of the best days of\
      \ my life were spent in those New Zealand waters with those guys.\r\n\r\nLike\
      \ the time Jimbo drove us up to Pakiri Beach and we had a section of an amazing\
      \ little beach break all to our selves.\r\n\r\nOr the time Woonie met me up\
      \ at Piha on my birthday, and I caught one of the biggest lefts of my life,\
      \ then bailed on it, and came up out of the water to see Woonie laughing.\r\n\
      \r\nOr the time Johannes and i went down to Raglan for big, messy (but otherwise\
      \ almost empty) waves for a Sunday afternoon.\r\n\r\nOr the time four of us\
      \ somehow managed to cram into Johannes\u2019 car with our boards to surf North\
      \ Piha, right next to the cliff, and I dropped in on Johannes (sorry, buddy).\r\
      \n\r\nOr the time Gui and I went out on the coldest day of the year and had\
      \ the entire beach to ourselves. (the waves weren\u2019t great, but it was still\
      \ an amazing experience).\r\n\r\nOr any of the other times where we paddled\
      \ out into the ocean off the coast of New Zealand to watch each other catch\
      \ waves, or to disappear from each other\u2019s sights when the rip was strong.\r\
      \n\r\nOr the Friday nights spent talking on What\u2019s App about where the\
      \ waves were best, and how early in the morning we\u2019d want to leave.\r\n\
      \r\nOr on the Monday mornings at work, when we\u2019d talk about the waves we\
      \ caught over the weekend, and would start looking at the forecast.\r\n\r\n\
      You can only spend so many days like that, so much time spent seeing the smile\
      \ on someone\u2019s face after they\u2019ve caught an amazing wave, or having\
      \ them see one on yours, and not consider them friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo there\
      \ you go, Johannes. I wrote about you guys. I miss you dudes and hope we connect\
      \ for a surf mission again soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI guess if there was a moral\
      \ to this story it would be to enjoy the moment.\r\n\r\nOr maybe that the friends\
      \ you make today will be your friends for life.\r\n\r\nOr maybe that you should\
      \ just get up early to go surfing. Preferably with some good friends.\r\n\r\n\

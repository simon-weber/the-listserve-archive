      \ bedroom, and a good school district. We were told there was another offer\
      \ on the house, and to submit a \u201Cbest & final\u201D offer. We submitted\
      \ the offer, and got a call back saying our offer was not the high one, but\
      \ they liked our steady jobs compared to the other buyers. This is when I first\
      \ realized how insane buying a house truly is.\r\n\r\n We said no and moved\
      \ on. We had been trying to see another house (house #2) on the other side of\
      \ town- once before house #1, and two times after. It had gone under contract\
      \ before we had put an offer on house #1, but came back on the market. We scheduled\
      \ an appointment to see house #2, and on the way got a call that it was under\
      \ contract again. Finally, our realtor reached out and we were able to tour\
      \ the house. 5 bedrooms, 3 full bathrooms, an outdoor pool, and a beautiful\
      \ kitchen. So we put in the offer on house #2, which was accepted.\r\n\r\n We\
      \ had many inspections, as we had learned from friends the many things that\
      \ can go wrong. We had a chimney inspection and a sewer inspection, in addition\
      \ to the normal home inspection. It paid off to have the chimney inspection-\
      \ there were problems with the mortar in between the chimney flue sections.\
      \ We were quoted about $3500 to repair. The sellers wanted to get another bid,\
      \ which was completely fine; they were quoted $3800 to repair. The sellers were\
      \ still unhappy with this number, so they asked for a third quote, which came\
      \ in at $2175.  This quote was from Ridgway Chimney Service here in NJ.\r\n\r\
      \n There were a plethora of negative reviews online, but we reluctantly say\
      \ yes. We figured that at least the job would be completed according to code.\
      \ This is where the horror show begins. The morning of closing, I look out at\
      \ the chimney and notice the moss was still on the chimney. It was supposed\
      \ to be sealed- how could they seal over moss? We put in a call, and Alan Ridgway,\
      \ the owner, was verbally abusive towards me. We get him to agree to come out,\
      \ scrape off the moss, and reseal the chimney.\r\n\r\n We decided to close on\
      \ the house, because it looks that all the other work is done (but how can you\
      \ be sure?). After closing, we get our chimney re-inspected, utilizing the first\
      \ company. I said something to the effect that we hadn\u2019t been able to negotiate\
      \ with the seller, so we wanted him to come back out and take a look. \u201C\
      What happened here? This chimney is in much worse shape than a month or so ago!\u201D\
      \ My heart sank. Ridgway Chimney Service had done $7000 worth of damage to our\
      \ chimney, and we are unable to use it due to an incorrect liner not lifting\
      \ enough smoke out. It wasn\u2019t sealed around the liner they put in, either,\
      \ so combustibles can get through the old terra cotta liner and light other\
      \ building materials. The best part? Our contract wasn\u2019t with Ridgway,\
      \ so we can\u2019t sue them. It will take $5000 to sue the seller for the $7000,\
      \ as we\u2019re out of the small claims court territory monetarily. So our house\
      \ has an unworkable chimney, which will cost us out of pocket to repair.\r\n\

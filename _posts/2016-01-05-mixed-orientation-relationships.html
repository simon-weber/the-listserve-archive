      <p>I''m a bisexual divorced mom who''s currently in a relationship with a gay
      man. This man and I have been best friends for 31 years- we met in preschool.
      Everything is fantastic except we don''t have sex- only to procreate. We have
      a son together. Most people say it can''t work, and I say it does, except for

      I''d rather be in a perfect sexless relationship than a sex-filled abusive relationship.</p>

      <p>Just wanted to let you know that there are mixed orientation relationships
      out there that people choose and it can work. Perfect? No. Better than the alternative?
      Yes. </p>

      \ so here goes. Briefly, I\u2019m a geeky trademark, copyright, and Internet\
      \ lawyer in Chicago, but I am more than that. I am a husband to 1, a father\
      \ to 3 boys, a legal blogger, a friend, a relative, a Scoutmaster, and a neighbor.\r\
      \n\r\nLike many of you, I struggle with the everydayness \u2013 the routine,\
      \ the commute, and trying to juggle it all. I depend on my GTD system, while\
      \ I worry I\u2019m not being a good husband or father at the expense of work.\r\
      \n\r\nYears ago my wife happened to work with the adult child of a former lawyer\
      \ boss, and it was a revelation seeing him again through their eyes. He was\
      \ never home, always working, and that person never forgave him for that. You\
      \ can\u2019t make up for not being there with gifts. As a result, I always try\
      \ to keep a good work-life balance, but it is hard. When I moved from a small\
      \ firm to a larger firm it was a struggle to maintain the balance, but I hope\
      \ I have.\r\n\r\nMy favorite SF book is Dune, by Frank Herbert. I love how Paul\
      \ transforms into more than what anyone else tried to make him into. The movie\
      \ and miniseries adaptations haven\u2019t totally done it justice, it\u2019\
      s a book that rewards re-reading. My favorite fantasy series would have to be\
      \ Lord of the Rings, with Harry Potter a close second these days. I also have\
      \ to give a shout out to Douglas Adams \u2013 I wish he hadn\u2019t had an existence\
      \ malfunction. 42!\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been a fan of Doctor Who since Tom Baker,\
      \ and really love how every new Doctor brings something new to the role and\
      \ series. In my HS yearbook, I was \u201Cmost likely to become the next Doctor\
      \ Who.\u201D I\u2019m looking forward to the new Doctor \u2013 go Jodie!\r\n\
      \r\nMy wife is an angel, she puts up with me and all my geeky lawyer quirks.\r\
      \n\r\nMy oldest son needs to get working on his Eagle project, but we are very\
      \ proud of him. He balances a lot between robotics, scouts, and school, plus\
      \ work on the side.\r\n\r\nMy middle son is autistic with anxiety issues, so\
      \ those of you out there with those issues or have family with those issues\
      \ I hear you and understand you. We are very proud of him.\r\n\r\nMy youngest\
      \ son got me playing Pokemon Go, and now I play more than he does. Currently\
      \ Level 38, Mystic. These days it\u2019s hard to find him without his nose in\
      \ a book \u2013 a good problem to have, IMHO.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s amazing how many\
      \ adults I come across playing Pokemon Go \u2013 the social aspect of the current\
      \ raid system has been good for that, meeting lots of people in the area I wouldn\u2019\
      t ordinarily have met.\r\n\r\nI am transplanted from the Madison, WI area, so\
      \ go Badgers! I used to play trumpet in the UW Band many years ago. I wish my\
      \ Packers were doing better this year, but we can\u2019t have it all. On, Wisconsin!\r\
      \n\r\nIf anyone wants to learn more about trademark, copyright, or internet\

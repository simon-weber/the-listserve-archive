    body: "Working on the therapeutic team of an Addiction Centre in South Africa,\
      \ my country.  On night shift right now, in an enormous Cape Dutch house in\
      \ the middle of a forest. All clients are asleep. I have just done my first\
      \ round after lights out and felt again that peculiar hyper vigilance as I stood\
      \ beside each sleeping client and listened to their breathing, looked at their\
      \ sleeping position, scanned the room and the areas beyond the room.  As an\
      \ R.N. my job is mainstream medical \u2013 medications (all the rules and regulations,\
      \ policies and procedures that go with that), vital signs, discussion with the\
      \ diabetic about his blood levels and carbohydrates, observing the 25 year old\
      \ with cirrhosis of the liver and a history of alcohol abuse from a young age,\
      \ reading the report from the psychiatrist who evaluated the effect of medication\
      \ on a client with bipolar disorder, watching the clients as they watch a horror\
      \ movie and noting their responses, looking forward to the 30 minute walk I\
      \ take with all of them in the early morning and as I passed into my office\
      \ grabbing an apple from the dish of fruit always topped up and available for\
      \ staff and clients.  The water is sweet here, I think it comes from an underground\
      \ spring.  One of the clients did not sleep well last night and on the group\
      \ walk this morning I asked him what had been on his mind and it was a book\
      \ he had been reading.  We talked and I was flabbergasted at the depth of sensitivity\
      \ and awareness he brought to the story. The \u201Cwater\u201D of his soul comes\
      \ from the same deep spring as that of all souls.  Somewhere and sometime \u2013\
      \ maybe trauma, maybe genetic predispositioning, maybe just damn stupid choices,\
      \ maybe loneliness, maybe a visionaries\u2019 longing for the transcendent,\
      \ maybe sheer availability of substances \u2013 somewhere and sometime all these\
      \ clients have said yes and followed that with a movement of their own hands\
      \ to their own mouths and perhaps later to their own noses and veins.  They\
      \ were lucid when they made the first move, when they said the first yes, had\
      \ the first hit, felt the first comedown after a high.  Then they said yes again.\
      \  And many yesses later here they are with short term memory loss, impaired\
      \ judgement, estrangement from parents / family / friends, unemployable and\
      \ with a bad work history.\r\nI was asleep in my flat and I woke up to find\
      \ a man standing at the corner of my bed watching me sleep.  He had both my\
      \ laptops, one under each arm.  I was so angry!  I growled at him \u201CWhat\
      \ are you doing here?  Get out,\u201D and with that said \u201CJesus!\u201D\
      \ and flew out of bed to kill him. I was that angry.  He fled!  With my laptops.\
      \  Long story about police and police case and trying to trace the laptops,\
      \ to no avail.  Fast forward.  I commissioned the local Nar Anon group in a\
      \ little town in South Africa and walked into the building in which we shared\
      \ an adjacent room with Narcotics Anonymous. There, looking very fragile, was\
      \ the man who had stolen my laptops. He was so out of it, so dirty, clothed\
      \ too lightly for winter.  I tried to make eye contact but he just kept looking\
      \ down.  I made him a mug of coffee and gave him a biscuit.  What have I lost?\
      \  Two laptops.  He\u2019s lost his place in society, his self-respect and his\
      \ health.  I later met up again with the investigating officer for the case\
      \ and told him I had seen the man and where.  The detective said I should have\
      \ reported it.  I said Nar Anon is anonymous.  Confidentiality is water tight.\
      \ He shrugged.\r\nMy son \u201Ctested\u201D drugs and it changed him.  Short\
      \ term memory loss, personality changes. But subtle.  He is a successful business\
      \ man now, a fantastic father, an adored husband, the writer of two books, a\
      \ surfer, an artist, a gifted man.  But with a deep, primal anger at me.  I\
      \ have invited him several times over the last twenty years to come to counselling\
      \ with me but he refuses. He says he has no interest in \u201Call that psychotherapy\
      \ mumbo jumbo.\u201D  \u201CThere is nothing wrong with me, you are the problem,\u201D\
      \  he tells me. But he will not sit with me and tell me what it is he holds\
      \ against me.  He says it is the divorce.  He was young, only just a teenager.\
      \  But we had a good relationship after the divorce, for many years.  Until.\
      \  It took me many years to twig that his behaviour was drug related.  He has\
      \ been \u201Cclean\u201D for many years.  I respect and admire what he has made\
      \ of his life.  With me he recycles grudges, holds me in contempt, lacks communication\
      \ skills and last year in August told me he does not want me in his life and\
      \ that if I want to see his family I have to ask his permission first.  I have\
      \ had a long time to think and I understand that he needs his anger.  He needs\
      \ his resentment.  He uses it for drive.  He needs to have me to kick against.\
      \  It fuels his energy.  He is making a huge success of his business.  His wife\
      \ is loyal (I miss her SO MUCH).  I miss my grandchildren.\r\nSo I have lost\
      \ my son.  I miss what we had.  I miss HIM.  Now I am on duty in the middle\
      \ of the forest, in this huge house, typing out the listserve.  With me are\
      \ the sons and daughters of many parents.  And I am committed to this.  If any\
      \ soul gets to that point in their lives where they want to get well and stop\
      \ using, if they have come all the way through from that moment of truth to\
      \ this demanding programme on a continent far removed from their own, I am there.\
      \  I will be here.  Sticking to my role, practicing my profession.  My role\
      \ does not include psychotherapy or counselling but I can listen.  And how they\
      \ talk!  There is an upholstered armchair in my office.  Sometimes they say\
      \ something and the \u201Clights go on\u201D as it were.  At those moments I\
      \ am glad I am a listener.  A gentle and safe presence for them.  I think my\
      \ grey hair is a plus.  I am a grandmother, a listener, a skilled helper.  I\
      \ am glad it is not my job to be a therapist although with my background, training\
      \ and experience I know what it entails.  I like it that they sit in the chair\
      \ and talk.  The corner, the chair, the forest, the large house, the tight routine,\
      \ the skilled dedication of the team.  I have lost my son.  I can either sit\
      \ at home and grieve for the rest of my life or I can do what I am doing now.\
      \  Use the loss to serve, to listen, to stay in the stream of sweet water from\
      \ the source.\r\nWow, that was a long story from someone whose first response\
      \ to hearing it was her turn to do the listserve was an ummmmmm \u2026\u2026\

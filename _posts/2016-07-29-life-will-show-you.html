      \ macaroni is what ended up on my plate. As my Russian improved, I began to\
      \ immerse myself into a beautiful culture few westerners know much about. Life\
      \ had shown me how to communicate.\r\n\r\nAfter living with my host family for\
      \ three months, I moved into a small apartment complex. I bought some cookies\
      \ and introduced myself to my neighbors (how very American of me!). When an\

      \ (in pretty broken Russian) and they invited me in for tea. Little did I know\
      \ that I had met my new Babushka (grandma) and Dedushka (grandpa). Every day\

      \ Even though they receive very little in retirement (<$100/month) and live\
      \ in a 500 sq. ft. apartment without hot water, they were willing to share their\
      \ food with me and never asked for anything in return. Through their kindness\
      \ and generosity, I became part of their family. They are always with me as\

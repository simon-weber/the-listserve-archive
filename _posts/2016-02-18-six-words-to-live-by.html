      John Rubadeau, an English professor at the University of Michigan, implored\
      \ us to make the private public. He did so by asking each of us to pen a short\
      \ essay, an essay in which we\u2019d share our secrets.\r\n\r\nI learned of\
      \ the moment Randy\u2019s life had turned upside down and that Kyle actually\
      \ met her boyfriend on jDate, along with 22 other closely-held secrets..\r\n\
      \r\nFor each 3-page essay we read, John expected every us to write six pages\
      \ of feedback. My final essay was three pages, and I received 144 pages of critique.\
      \ John called this quid pro quo.\r\n\r\nOur commitment to improving each other\u2019\
      s work paid huge dividends; individual students couldn\u2019t become better\
      \ writers, the entire class had to improve as a unit.\r\n\r\nBy the semester\u2019\
      s end, John had transformed this group of strangers into a family. In three\
      \ pages, I learned more from my classmates than I had learned from many of my\
      \ friends.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating from college, I took my fondness for entrepreneurship,\
      \ startups, and design thinking and turned it into a career. Though my work\
      \ is fulfilling, I\u2019ve found it difficult to practice quid pro quo in the\
      \ tech industry.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve had one true quid pro quo moment in my adult\
      \ life. My mother was diagnosed with leukemia in 2011, and I was asked to donate\
      \ my stem cells to her. It was an obvious decision\u2013\u2013one that any child\
      \ would make. She lived, and I am thankful for modern medicine each and every\
      \ day.\r\n\r\nThen, three months ago, I received a call from Be the Match; a\
      \ 62-year old male with blood cancer needed a stem cell transplant and now I\u2019\
      m donating stem cells a second time. I\u2019ll be physically uncomfortable for\
      \ a week, but I\u2019m ecstatic because I have the opportunity to extend this\
      \ man\u2019s life.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s exceedingly rare for someone to donate stem\
      \ cells twice, and donating stem cells is easily the most selfless, generous\
      \ thing I\u2019ve ever done. As I\u2019ve prepared for this second stem cell\
      \ experience, I\u2019ve realized that I need to be more generous in my daily\
      \ life.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to John\u2019s second piece of advice: scratch\
      \ your itch. Being kind\u2013\u2013to myself and to others\u2013\u2013has become\
      \ an itch that I need to scratch.\r\n\r\nI want to help myself, and others,\
      \ be more generous in their daily life. I dream of taking John\u2019s advice\
      \ into the virtual world\u2013\u2013a community where people challenge each\
      \ other to live a more fulfilled and selfless life.\r\n\r\nImagine if, every\
      \ day, you received a prompt that would help you live a more balanced, mindful,\
      \ and generous life. With these prompts, you\u2019d get exposure to new perspectives\
      \ and you\u2019d push the limits of your comfort zone. Each prompt would be\
      \ written by a member of the community; you\u2019d be able to track your own\
      \ progress, and see how many others participated in the daily quid pro quo prompt.\r\
      \n\r\nExamples of daily prompts:\r\nGenerosity: Buy a stranger coffee, with\
      \ no strings attached\r\nRelax: Walk a mile without pulling out your phone.\
      \ Listen and observe\r\nBury the hatchet: Apologize for something you\u2019\
      ve regretted for a long time\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re interested in practicing\
      \ quid pro quo on a daily basis, send a prompt idea to LiveQuid@gmail.com. I\u2019\
      ll start sending you prompts to live a more mindful, generous life and you\u2019\
      ll be helping me scratch an itch of my own.\r\n\r\nWhatever you do, remember\
      \ these six words to live a better life and have a more fulfilling career: quid\

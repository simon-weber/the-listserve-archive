      So the only way I\u2019m able to sleep is if I do something worthwhile with\
      \ all that I\u2019ve been given. So many people in this country alone have had\

      \ service. Maybe it's the Eagle Scout in me, maybe it's the Massachusetts Democrat,\
      \ but there is something incredibly meaningful in using the combined power of\
      \ millions to help millions more, to leverage the power of the people to righteous\

      \ (Georgetown, if I\u2019m lucky). I\u2019m trying to get more involved in the\
      \ Democratic party and charitable organizations. I hope, one day, to have a\

      <p>Germany - It was my dream to work abroad. Few months after graduating I got
      chance to get a job in Germany as a project manager/SEO specialist. The problem
      was, I had to leave my friends and family in just 2 weeks, what appeared to
      me as the hardest thing. The challenge was really big: getting used to new people,
      new language, new culture and becoming profi in areas I hadnt had relevant experiences
      before. After two and half months I was fired.</p>

      <p>I was thinking a lot about this experience and got following conclusion:</p>

      <p>1. "I do not regret the things I''ve done, but those I did not do." (Rory
      Cochrane) - Sometimes we are stucked in deciding whether to do something or
      not. In my opinion it is worthwhile to give a try. Staying in Germany gave me
      life lecture I would not get otherwise in 10 years.</p>

      <p>2. Give 100% to anything.    Nobody is perfect. It is not fair to blame yourself
      in case you didn&#180;t succeed. More important is to do everything you are
      able and qualified to. If you know you made you best, do not care with thoughs
      about lost opportunity, but prepare for those upcoming!</p>

      <p>3. Be happy to share your time with friend and family - In my opinion, this
      is how one can live his/her life peacefully and satisfied. Having just enough
      money or perfect job is not enough, if we do not have people to share it with.

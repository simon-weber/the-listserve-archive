      \ from Kansas, USA. (Rock Chalk Jayhawk!) Despite the unfortunate current political\
      \ landscape of my state, I have to say it was a pretty nice place to grow up\
      \ and most definitely has the best sunsets of any place I\u2019ve ever seen\
      \ (no trees or hills has to be good for something, am I right?!).\r\n\r\nAnyhow,\
      \ now I live in Brooklyn, New York and currently work as a trauma therapist\
      \ at a domestic violence agency.  Unfortunately, domestic violence continues\
      \ to be an extremely prevalent social problem across all races and classes,\
      \ and is not well understood in our society. In my clinical work, I am most\
      \ interested in the complex, yet subtle ways that trauma is transmitted inter-generationally.\
      \ I think that if we can better understand this dynamic on a larger scale it\
      \ can help prevent future generations from repeating pain from the past. If\
      \ you have any thoughts on this, I am all ears!\r\n\r\nAs a human being interacting\
      \ with other human beings in this world, I have noticed that when we are suffering,\
      \ feeling sadness, anger, or completely alone, even though it feels scary, it\
      \ is often when we open up and make ourselves most vulnerable to express that\
      \ pain to another that we find the deepest of human connections and healing.\
      \ On the other hand, sometimes you just need to hide under the covers and watch\
      \ reruns of Cheers (still so hilarious and has the best theme song ever) with\
      \ a bottle of wine till it all starts to feel better. I think there is a balance\
      \ somewhere...\r\n\r\nFinally, I'd like to give a shout out to my friend Nichol,\
      \ who introduced me to the Listserve, who is one of the best human beings I\

      \ I owe him about a bazillion rum punches.\r\n\r\nI'll leave you with a poem\

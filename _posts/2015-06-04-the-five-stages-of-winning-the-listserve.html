      On the other hand, don''t even pretend like you haven''t sat and thought about

      <p>2) Anger/Sadness: This stage largely revolves around the realization that
      you probably don''t have that many life happenings that make for fantastic or
      breath taking stories. In addition, you''ll come to realize that your life advice
      is likely cliche, and that most of us dream of doing amazing things but can''t
      for some reason, living each day hopeful of what''s around the corner and making
      the best of the situation. Also, you''re probably not that witty.</p>

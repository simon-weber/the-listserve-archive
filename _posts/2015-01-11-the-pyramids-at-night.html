      \ out, blackness surrounds us on all sides, save for the dunes and craggy rock\
      \ glistening in the light of the full moon. We trot slowly for thirty minutes\
      \ as we move over increasingly inclined terrain. I look back and see the view\
      \ getting more and more vast behind me. I can see a fire in the distance, men\
      \ who make camp fire tea for night riders. We dismount and order a tea each,\

      \n\r\nWith hashish and alcohol pumping through my veins, the smell of of a camp\

      \ before me. I've never seen stars so clearly before. The milky way flows above\
      \ while I contemplate life and the human condition. I feel at peace. The greatest\
      \ city in the world to my right, bright and alive. And the pyramids, which I\
      \ think must be the work of creatures from a far flung galaxy, to my left. Silently,\
      \ I wax philosophic, challenging old ideals and creating new ones, turning everything\
      \ I've ever been taught about life on its head. I'm roused from my state by\
      \ Tariq telling me it's time to head back. Mounted on my horse once more, we\
      \ canter while I run through the things I've just seen in my mind. We begin\
      \ to gallop, moving in unison while the wind whips through my hair. My heart\
      \ is pounding in my throat and I feel alive, my senses sharpening, adrenaline\
      \ replacing the calm that drugs had brought on. We race, my horse and I, my\
      \ breathing matching hers. We round a dune and the glory that is Cairo comes\
      \ into full view. Awe overtakes me. The frigid night air pricks at my skin and\
      \ I realize that this very moment in time could have been any moment in history.\
      \ I feel connected to my ancestors. Men and women that although I've never met,\
      \ I know they saw the same thing that I'm seeing now and I know they too must\
      \ have a felt a sense of awe while they gazed out over the city of the living,\
      \ in the middle of the land of the dead. As we pull up to the stables, I look\
      \ back toward the dunes and the inky sky above. Even now, as I look at the desert\
      \ calm, the memories are already beginning to fade. Like a dream, the revelations\
      \ and life changing ideas that had walked across my consciousness only minutes\
      \ ago are now draining from me and from now until forever will be relegated\
      \ to my mind's eye. Emerging when least expected, only to fade again like so\

      \ a professor and finding someone to spend my life with, and neither of those\
      \ was working out. I applied for jobs, considered an MBA, almost moved to China,\
      \ and read.   Then I met Michael playing soccer. Somehow he saw past the shell\
      \ I\u2019d become. He dated me for five months until I made the conscientious\
      \ decision to love him and really started dating him back. I finally found a\
      \ job at a startup in San Francisco. The pay was so lousy that I had to stay\
      \ in a relative\u2019s basement while the job killed me slowly.   A book made\
      \ me realize that I\u2019m an introvert, so I decided to talk to my boss the\
      \ next day about making some changes. On the way to work, with a spring in my\
      \ step, I broke my foot.\r\n\r\nWorking from home, I started opening tabs about\
      \ learning technical skills. On the deadline for a school that trains women\
      \ to become web developers/software engineers in ten weeks, I sent in a rather\
      \ cursory application, though I didn\u2019t have a clue what things like \u201C\
      Python,\u201D \u201CBackend,\u201D and \u201CGit\u201D referred to.\r\n\r\n\
      But then I was in a wheelchair for a while and I had to defer, and to make things\
      \ worse, I needed a new apartment. (Wheelchair-friendly places in San Francisco?\
      \ Ha!) Michael and I debated getting married, but life was too hectic.\r\n\r\
      \nFinally, finally, things started clicking. We were offered lowered rent for\
      \ managing a building, and the owner preferred couples. Being Mormon, we decided\
      \ to get married. We became engaged and decided that with the apartment and\
      \ school starting soon and in hopes of getting gift money to pay for Hackbright\
      \ Academy, we\u2019d get married in one month.\r\n\r\nOur wedding was wonderfully\
      \ simple and the stability of marriage countered the intensity of the program.\
      \ Hackbright Academy was one of the most difficult and best things I have ever\
      \ done. I slaved through pair programming, learning a new vocabulary, and building\
      \ my first application, BookFairy. Within a week of graduating, I was offered\
      \ a job. I nervously made a brave counter offer, and it was accepted!\r\n\r\n\
      How come I didn\u2019t find my niche earlier?! I was in technology clubs in\
      \ school and fascinated by techie stuff. So why didn't anyone ever say, \"Michelle,\
      \ you actually aren't that great at essays, but you like computers. Did you\
      \ know that you could have a career making them do cool things?\"\r\n\r\nI blame\
      \ it on my gender. Girls aren\u2019t introduced to technology as early and they\
      \ are subliminally encouraged to get impractical educations when they could\
      \ excel in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Did you know that\
      \ the amount of female developers has decreased since the 80s? It is now down\
      \ to about 9-11%. It can be difficult to work in a male-dominated field, but\
      \ that\u2019s all the more reason for more women to forge the tech pathway.\r\
      \n\r\nI can\u2019t recommend this path enough. My husband and San Francisco\u2019\
      s techies have been amazingly supportive, I love what I\u2019m doing, and my\
      \ salary is about 18 times more than my total income last year. I want to tell\
      \ everyone, \u201CWomen can rock at web development, too! Girls, here are some\
      \ cool things I've built that you could build too, being a dev is awesome! You\

      It''s a hard choice to make, especially in the age of an internet which famously
      never forgets. Googling my name still results in pictures and news articles
      from years ago. It''d be nice to move on, to have my public presence match who
      I am and what I''m doing now, rather than essentially having been frozen in
      time by a particular event.At the same time, I can''t support those who seek
      to completely wash away the past. So many societal injustices have been perpetuated
      and then swept under the rug in the name of "moving on" while the effects linger
      for generations. So many abusers have been given free reign to continue their
      actions unchecked because no one will talk about them. On some level it''s critical
      that we own the past and acknowledge the legacy it has left us.</p>

      <p>I''m just not sure where to draw the line. Easy access to global information
      has been a mixed blessing and curse: it''s that much easier to get people involved,
      but it''s also that much easier for people to involve themselves. I''ve seen

      <p>There''s no perfect solution to this problem. We''re all individual people

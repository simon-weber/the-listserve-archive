      <p>I have no shame.  I''ve done stuff some people would say I should feel<br
      />shame for.  I''ve had sex in places and at times and with people that<br />were
      probably not appropriate.  I''ve used drugs and drank to excess.<br />I''m not
      ashamed of any of it.  I have not hurt anyone emotionally or<br />physically,
      at least not any more than they deserved.  I would be<br />ashamed of that if
      I had.  This is the only life I''m going to get so I<br />intend to live it,
      at least as much as I can within the confines of<br />the situation I find myself
      in.</p>

      <p>I have regrets, for things I didn''t do.  I started doing things late<br
      />in life.  I should have started doing things when I was young and<br />beautiful.  Now
      that I''m old and hideous they are more difficult if<br />not impossible.  I''m
      not good at anything but I keep trying.  Things I<br />enjoy I keep doing even
      though I am terrible at them.  I''m glad most<br />people are patient with incompetent

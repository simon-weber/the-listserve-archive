      \ I found myself in a social group of mostly gay women and whenever I was asked\

      \ my whole life\u2026I\u2019ve had crushes on boys since I was in elementary\

      \ men and I never had a crush on a girl\u2026so I was straight, obviously. Right?\
      \  Well, no, not exactly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I first met her, I just couldn\u2019\
      t stop staring. Soon we started talking and I felt compelled to always be near\

      \ almost subconscious, this desire to be around her. I couldn\u2019t form thoughts\
      \ or words to explain it. Then one day she took my hand and that was pretty\

      \  a real struggle to figure out how I wanted to identify. It was a crisis of\
      \ self way after I thought those things were over. I didn\u2019t feel gay or\
      \ straight or bi or anything really.  I read that bisexual women have a higher\
      \ rate of anxiety and depression than straight or gay women and I can completely\
      \ understand why.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy am I telling all of you this? Because it\u2019\
      s hard to not fit. It\u2019s hard to not feel like you are like everyone else.\
      \ Your struggle isn\u2019t exactly like mine and mine isn\u2019t like yours,\

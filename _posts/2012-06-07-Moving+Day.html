<p>Since the email from the nice people at The Listserve caught<br />me on the morning of moving day, I&#8217;m filling this email with<br />fragments from journals I found during the move, flipping<br />through them at random and typing out what I find interesting<br />until I hit the word limit:</p>
<p>Recent revelation upon looking at the books scattered around<br />the house: we&#8217;ve always been more into gnomes than genomes.</p>
<p>I am most impressed by those who can find the signal in the<br />noise. People like David Foster Wallace, W.H. Auden, Amy<br />Hempel, Rob Greco, my sister, Matthew Weiner, Sherlock<br />Holmes, Deron Bauman, Al Swearengen, Frank Chimero, Ira<br />Glass, Noah Dennis, Patrick Rothfuss, Ze Frank.</p>
<p>Would we think differently with our brains in our feet?</p>
<p>Book idea: How to Look at People</p>
<p>The closest thing to a Mos Eisley experience = Colorado,<br />mountain town bars, the characters, the eclecticism,<br />the realia of the local.</p>
<p>Dreams of megafauna are my favorite.</p>
<p>"[He] used to claim that there&#8217;s no freedom quite<br />like the freedom of being constantly underestimated."<br />&#8211; The Lies of Locke Lamora</p>
<p>Next project: put together a resource for a daily<br />"Lucky Ten Thousand" for my students.</p>
<p>Matt Thomas: "To live in Iowa -- and to stay sane<br />-- requires the cultivation of a vast inner geography."<br />&#8211; yes, exactly, that&#8217;s how I survived, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Remember, it's the cheese that keeps us connected like<br />the chips in Paula Deen's nachos.</p>
<p>For some reason I'm fairly confident that oompaloompas<br />would have loved Melanzanas.</p>
<p>"I like trees because they seem more resigned to the way<br />they have to live than other things do." &#8211; Willa Cather,<br />O Pioneers!</p>
<p>I wonder how much our current mental state is dependent<br />upon our ability to imagine a happy/fulfilling, realistic<br />future?</p>
<p>"He turns the empty glass in his hand, and considers<br />biting off the rim." &#8211; from Raymond Carver's "What Is It?"</p>
<p>Writing prompt idea: Write a sentence that you are sure<br />that no one on earth has ever written before.</p>
<p>careworn = best adjective</p>

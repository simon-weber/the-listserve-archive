      <p>Parts of me to share:</p>

      <p>A poem:</p>

      <p>Yawning after the Noon<br />I listen to the silent chatter<br />of outside,
      sprinkled with white<br />pieces of sky. It&#8217;s a mystery to me.<br />How
      placid I feel while the Earth<br />journey through the chaos</p>

      <p>Do I stand still, chained<br />by my sludgy temperament?<br />Or do I swirl
      alongside frosted dust?</p>

      <p>I choose to flutter down the hazy<br />ivory sky, always moving<br />always
      a try.</p>

      />Wild</p>

      <p>Bands I love:<br />AltJ<br />Lady Antebellum<br />First Aid Kit</p>

      <p>Dance freely<br />To hike the Pacific Crest Trail, a dream<br />I want to
      run in an open field full of flowers<br />I like the thought process of essay
      writing</p>

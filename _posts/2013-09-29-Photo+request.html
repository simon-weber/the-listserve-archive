<p>I'm not sure I have anything to say, or wisdom to impart, but I was wondering if you might send me a photo?</p>
<p>It can be anything in your life. A pic of your daily commute, a photo from your favorite vacation, a picture you happened to take recently on your phone. </p>
<p>I promise not to publish or utilize it in any way. I just want to know what your life is like. </p>

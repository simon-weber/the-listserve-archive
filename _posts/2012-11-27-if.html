<p>I used to read a lot of poetry and want to get back into the habit of it. Below is a poem by Rudyard Kipling that I'd like to share with all of you, and I'd like to ask you to email me a poem or two back in response. I look forward to reading them.</p>
<p>If--<br />By Rudyard Kipling</p>
<p>If you can keep your head when all about you<br />    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br />If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br />    But make allowance for their doubting too;<br />If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br />    Or being lied about, don&#8217;t deal in lies,<br />Or being hated, don&#8217;t give way to hating,<br />    And yet don&#8217;t look too good, nor talk too wise:</p>
<p>If you can dream&#8212;and not make dreams your master;<br />    If you can think&#8212;and not make thoughts your aim;<br />If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br />    And treat those two impostors just the same;<br />If you can bear to hear the truth you&#8217;ve spoken<br />    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br />Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br />    And stoop and build &#8217;em up with worn-out tools:</p>
<p>If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br />    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br />And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br />    And never breathe a word about your loss;<br />If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br />    To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br />And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br />    Except the Will which says to them: &#8216;Hold on!&#8217;</p>
<p>If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br />    Or walk with Kings&#8212;nor lose the common touch,<br />If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br />    If all men count with you, but none too much;<br />If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br />    With sixty seconds&#8217; worth of distance run,<br />Yours is the Earth and everything that&#8217;s in it,<br />    And&#8212;which is more&#8212;you&#8217;ll be a Man, my son!</p>

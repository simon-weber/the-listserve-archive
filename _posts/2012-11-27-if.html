    \ stoop and build \u2019em up with worn-out tools:\r\n\r\nIf you can make one\

    \nAnd lose, and start again at your beginnings\r\n    And never breathe a word\
    \ about your loss;\r\nIf you can force your heart and nerve and sinew\r\n    To\
    \ serve your turn long after they are gone,\r\nAnd so hold on when there is nothing\
    \ in you\r\n    Except the Will which says to them: \u2018Hold on!\u2019\r\n\r\
    \nIf you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,\r\n    Or walk with Kings\u2014\
    nor lose the common touch,\r\nIf neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,\r\
    \n    If all men count with you, but none too much;\r\nIf you can fill the unforgiving\
    \ minute\r\n    With sixty seconds\u2019 worth of distance run,\r\nYours is the\
    \ Earth and everything that\u2019s in it,\r\n    And\u2014which is more\u2014\

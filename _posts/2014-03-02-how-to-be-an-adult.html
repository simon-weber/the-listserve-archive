      <p>I was wondering what to say to 25,000 strangers, but I think I''ll just talk
      about "How to be an Adult." I know, I''m only 25 (nearly 26), but I have experienced
      quite a bit of life (including the past 3 years working in South Korea).</p>

      <p>Today, let''s talk about how to walk the fine line between being your own
      person versus being under your parents.</p>

      <p>I won''t go into details, but my newly divorced parents are going through
      a rough time in light of a staggering revelation. I love my parents equally,
      but it''s really hard to take when they are both throwing out terrible thoughts
      and untrue assumptions about the other. It is worsened by the fact that they
      both seem to come to me about it, when I am not under their care or protection
      anymore.</p>

      <p>So how does one manage this difficult balance? 3 ways:</p>

      <p>1.) By listening.</p>

      <p>I just listen, and listen respectfully. There are things that they may need
      to say, and as hard as it is for me to hear it, it just needs to be said. The
      point is NOT TO HOLD ON TO THOSE WORDS.* Personally, I do this through my faith
      in Christ, but the principle holds true. As the saying goes, "in one ear and
      out the other." If I were to hold onto those things, it would absolutely destroy
      me, which is not fair.</p>

      <p>2.) It''s their problem, not yours.</p>

      <p>I have my own life to live (of which I''m starting a new, terrifyingly exciting
      chapter), so I need to just let my parents deal with these things on their own.
      Of course it hurts me to see their hearts breaking, but I can''t carry this
      for them. They''re adults too, and while I love and respect them, in the end,
      it''s THEIR ISSUE, NOT MINE.</p>

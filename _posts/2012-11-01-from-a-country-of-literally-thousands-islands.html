<p>Hey there</p>
<p>Such a pleasant, odd chance to write to you. Thank you. I am a gen Y living in a developing country named Indonesia, working as a marketer in fmcg industry.</p>
<p>I read listserve e-mails every morning, love it. Most of them come from US though, so perhaps on this rare occasion to be selected, would like to share about this country, Indonesia, in 6 points:</p>
<p>1. We're located in south-east Asia. Neighbor to Thailand. Malaysia. Singapore. North of Australia.</p>
<p>2. We have total 17,508 islands and more than 500 different local languages</p>
<p>3. The most famous holiday spot is Bali, i believe. Pretty island beaches, rich culture, great people. Get called island of gods sometime.</p>
<p>4. Your Sumatra and Java coffee come from here. Of islands with same name</p>
<p>5. We have the tastiest instant noodle ever: Indomie. Maybe you can find one in ur local chinatown. They sell it in Amazon as well :D </p>
<p>6. Second largest home of Facebook user, and 6th largest for Twitter. Well since we're like the 4th most populated country in the world filled with happy chatty people. Haha.</p>
<p>Ok that's about my wordcount limit I guess. Wish you a pretty day. Do write to me if you want, it's nice to find more real people e-mails in the mailbox full of engine-generated mails nowadays :)</p>

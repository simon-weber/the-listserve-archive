<p>Dear fellow Listservians,</p>
<p>I'm not ready to address such a vast amount of people, 23,337 to be exact, but as it often happens in real life, opportunity strikes when least expected or prepared for, and who am I to cower?</p>
<p>The Listserve caught me at a strange point in my life: at the beginning. I'm 19 years old, just finished my first year of college, and 2 days ago, scored my first real job, as an assistant to a historian (thanks Andrea's dad!)Also, in just a few days, I celebrate my first anniversary with my boyfriend (hey Francisco!), who was also the person who told me of The Listserve.</p>
<p>So this is me, full of the start of it all.</p>
<p>Seeing that I'm writing this at the last moment, I might as well go at this stream of consciousness style (Go Holden Caulfield!)</p>
<p>Well, I'm currently thinking that friends are the most important thing, ever; there's college and work and family but it's friends that really make our life worthwhile; friends, and maybe children, but that's another chapter entirely.</p>
<p>Maybe I should give you guys some reading suggestions, if you've read this far, because I really haven't given you much reason for it, don't worry, none taken, it's coming out quite boring, I know. Well, I'm in the middle of 10,000 novels, but of the ones I've finished, there's 3 that take my heart:</p>
<p>The Catcher in the Rye<br />Tuesdays with Morrie<br />L'&#233;tranger</p>
<p>[If you can read in the original language do it! Translations never make justice]</p>
<p>Hasn't this ever happened to you? You're looking at someone and you're suddenly amazed, you have to take a step back and really look at them, eyes moving, lips moving, all for you; it's as if you're amazed they're even real. Well, this happens to me a lot with you Frankie, yes you Francisco, and I thank, every time, that you are.</p>
<p>This past year was rough, and I'm certain that if it weren't for you, I really don't know where I would find myself today; thanks for lending me a hand through the struggle, life couldn't have given me a more perfect person to love.</p>
<p>Now for music! YouTube (do it do it) these full albums:<br />Alt-J: An Awesome wave<br />Youth Lagoon: The Year of Hibernation<br />The Doors: The Doors<br />Oh, and every White Stripes and Red Hot Chili Peppers album.</p>
<p>If you're sad, listen to "Pale Blue eyes" by The Velvet Underground; if you're having an odd day, "Stephanie Says", also by them; oh and "These Days" by Nico.</p>
<p>Take a road trip, at least once; tell me about the adventure if you'd like.</p>
<p>To finish, in the whole year I've received emails, I've yet to see one from my country. I'm from the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico, mi patria. I must tell you: places run deeper than their waters and tourist attractions, next time, dig deeper.</p>
<p>It makes me infinitely sad to know I'll die &amp; never hear so many beautiful songs, so please, email me your favorite song! I'd love to hear it, I'll pass them on to my friends, I won't be so selfish.</p>
<p>I'll end this uneventful email with a quote (sue me for the clich&#233;dness of it all)</p>
<p>My music teacher once said, "Whenever you can, travel; you don't have to be incredibly wealthy, just incredibly curious."</p>

<p>P.S. Try buttered toast with sugar sprinkled on top, it's delicious, oh and, call your mom often</p>

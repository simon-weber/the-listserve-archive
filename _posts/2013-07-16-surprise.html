  body: "Dear fellow Listservians,\r\n\r\nI'm not ready to address such a vast amount\
    \ of people, 23,337 to be exact, but as it often happens in real life, opportunity\
    \ strikes when least expected or prepared for, and who am I to cower?\r\n\r\n\
    The Listserve caught me at a strange point in my life: at the beginning. I'm 19\
    \ years old, just finished my first year of college, and 2 days ago, scored my\
    \ first real job, as an assistant to a historian (thanks Andrea's dad!)Also, in\
    \ just a few days, I celebrate my first anniversary with my boyfriend (hey Francisco!),\
    \ who was also the person who told me of The Listserve.\r\n\r\nSo this is me,\
    \ full of the start of it all.\r\n\r\nSeeing that I'm writing this at the last\
    \ moment, I might as well go at this stream of consciousness style (Go Holden\
    \ Caulfield!)\r\n\r\nWell, I'm currently thinking that friends are the most important\
    \ thing, ever; there's college and work and family but it's friends that really\
    \ make our life worthwhile; friends, and maybe children, but that's another chapter\
    \ entirely.\r\n\r\nMaybe I should give you guys some reading suggestions, if you've\
    \ read this far, because I really haven't given you much reason for it, don't\
    \ worry, none taken, it's coming out quite boring, I know. Well, I'm in the middle\
    \ of 10,000 novels, but of the ones I've finished, there's 3 that take my heart:\r\
    \n\r\nThe Catcher in the Rye\r\nTuesdays with Morrie\r\nL'\xE9tranger\r\n\r\n\
    [If you can read in the original language do it! Translations never make justice]\r\
    \n\r\nHasn't this ever happened to you? You're looking at someone and you're suddenly\
    \ amazed, you have to take a step back and really look at them, eyes moving, lips\
    \ moving, all for you; it's as if you're amazed they're even real. Well, this\
    \ happens to me a lot with you Frankie, yes you Francisco, and I thank, every\
    \ time, that you are.\r\n\r\nThis past year was rough, and I'm certain that if\
    \ it weren't for you, I really don't know where I would find myself today; thanks\
    \ for lending me a hand through the struggle, life couldn't have given me a more\
    \ perfect person to love.\r\n\r\nNow for music! YouTube (do it do it) these full\
    \ albums:\r\nAlt-J: An Awesome wave\r\nYouth Lagoon: The Year of Hibernation\r\
    \nThe Doors: The Doors\r\nOh, and every White Stripes and Red Hot Chili Peppers\
    \ album.\r\n\r\nIf you're sad, listen to \"Pale Blue eyes\" by The Velvet Underground;\
    \ if you're having an odd day, \"Stephanie Says\", also by them; oh and \"These\
    \ Days\" by Nico.\r\n\r\nTake a road trip, at least once; tell me about the adventure\
    \ if you'd like.\r\n\r\nTo finish, in the whole year I've received emails, I've\
    \ yet to see one from my country. I'm from the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico,\
    \ mi patria. I must tell you: places run deeper than their waters and tourist\
    \ attractions, next time, dig deeper.\r\n\r\nIt makes me infinitely sad to know\
    \ I'll die & never hear so many beautiful songs, so please, email me your favorite\
    \ song! I'd love to hear it, I'll pass them on to my friends, I won't be so selfish.\r\
    \n\r\nI'll end this uneventful email with a quote (sue me for the clich\xE9dness\
    \ of it all)\r\n\r\nMy music teacher once said, \"Whenever you can, travel; you\
    \ don't have to be incredibly wealthy, just incredibly curious.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    Don't burn your brownies,\r\n\r\nRoc\xEDo\r\nrociomercedes94@gmail.com\t\r\nSan\
    \ Juan, Puerto Rico\r\n\r\nP.S. Try buttered toast with sugar sprinkled on top,\

      <p>Dull are your eyes that once glimmered faintly</p>

      <p>Still are your tails that once waved so freely</p>

      <p>Death&#8217;s cold iron talons caught you and held you</p>

      <p>In the small violent waves and the algae and foam</p>

      <p>But the water that carried you now will receive you</p>

      <p>In the calm starry waves may you find yourself home</p>

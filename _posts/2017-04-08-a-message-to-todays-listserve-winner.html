      \r\nBut today, my message is just for you.\r\n\r\nI want to ask you to try an\
      \ experiment with me.\r\n\r\nI will write one word that you can copy and paste\
      \ to the end of your message submission. You can either ADD ONE more word or\
      \ CHANGE ONE word. And ask the next winner to do the same. Together, we\u2019\

      \ experiment that ties 21,000 complete strangers\u2014who otherwise may have\

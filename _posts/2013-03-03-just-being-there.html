<p>To all the people out there who we depend on to 'just be there' when we need you most. And those of who are constantly working to protect us. Thank you.</p>
<p>I recently took an opportunity to spend a 12 hour shift shadowing an Ambulance crew in an fairly typical mid sized city in the UK. It gave me a brief and touching glimpse of raw humanity. Sitting there in the back of an ambulance as it raced across the city to a someone desperately in need of help, it struck me; they just accept and don't think twice that no matter what 24 hours a day 7 days a week 365 days a year in less than 10 minutes help will always be there.</p>
<p>I feel deeply privileged and fortunate to live somewhere where that is possible. Just as I marvel that as I sit here writing this with a few clicks of a mouse this message will be delivered to just over 20,000 people spread across the globe.</p>
<p>Anybody can make a difference, you have to fight for change, stand up, speak up and make your voice heard. It is your responsibility not someone else's! If there is any wisdom that I can pass on from my short time in this world it is that if you see a problem you should do all you can to fix it, not just hope that someone else will notice and do something about it.</p>
<p>Don't accept, always think twice. Go out of your way to give someone an opportunity, make a stranger feel privileged. Pass it on. Let us know how you made someone feel lucky.</p>

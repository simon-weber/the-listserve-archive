<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>I originally joined the list serve as I wanted the opportunity to maybe one day promote my own business, BUT, my view of the list serve purpose has changed immensely!  I love receiving and reading about all of the different experiences, places and people everyday.</p>
<p>So here's what I have decided to share -</p>
<p>Follow your dreams, we live one life, make it count.  Pay it forward and practice random acts of kindness. I have always thought you need to have a 9-5 job and be sensible, stable and a hard worker, only then will you have a 'good' life.  Well, I have lived like that for most of my life, (only 34 years so far!), but I have decided I don't want a 'good life', I want a GREAT life!  I have been with the man of my dreams for almost 5 years and we have a beautiful little boy.  I want my son to grow up with amazing experiences and the knowledge he could be and do great things if he chooses to.  That doesn't mean an exciting job or doing dangerous things, it can be the small things you do.  Me personally, I am building my own photography business, which is my passion, I don't want to live the rest of my life in the daily grind, so I am making changes now, one day at a time.  My partner, he is living his dream as a DJ/Selector.  We are teaching our son, through the way we live, that he can be a 'Fireman-Super Hero-DJ-Motorbike Riding Stuntman'...if he really wants to be!  :)</p>
<p>My biggest piece of advice I can give to anyone is to make good financial investments early in your life....in the long term you will be grateful you did.  I chose not to and am severely kicking myself now over my lack of insight as a young person.  Living for the moment is in my nature, but I have learned you must also plan for the unknown in your future.  Even if it's a small investment now, it could be your saving grace in the future.  for example, at 19 I had the opportunity to buy a house, a medium size house for just $16,000, I listened to the advice of my then boyfriend and bought a new car instead.  That house is now worth over $100,000.  This is only 15 years later...ooh what I could do with one hundred thousand dollars right now....meanwhile the car I bought is long gone and never returned anything back to me.  Word from the wise...invest where and when you can, keep your credit clear and if you earn ten dollars, spend like you earned only five.</p>
<p>I live everyday filled with music, music is like oil to the rusty gate of life stresses.  I have such an eclectic taste in music.  I love Earth, Wind and Fire, Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye but equally love Salt'n'Pepa, Tanya Stephens, Jah Cure, Damien Marley  Whitney Houston, Usher, a LOT of 90s R&amp;B and pop.</p>
<p>I love laughing until you cry and your stomach hurts, a long day at the beach swimming and playing, running in the pouring rain on really hot, humid days, cuddling up and watching favourite movies on freezing cold, snowy days. I love books, I love to read and learn and know and share what I learn.</p>
<p>My advice on love is a cliche, love yourself first, with or without modifications.  Learn to love the person you are, look at your body every day and appreciate it, enjoy the way it moves and works, marvel at such a wonderful creation.  Be the kind of person you would like to be with  Then, when someone else can do the same thing, love you as a whole person just as you are, that's love.  Relationships are hard work and not always perfect, but, they can also be amazing adventures with equally amazing people.</p>
<p>You have unlimited potential and opportunities, explore life and learn about new people, places and things.</p>
<p>Live everyday with the intention to empower others to be the best they can be at whatever they choose to do, even in the small details - I believe that is the meaning of life, be the best version of you that you can be and empower the next generation to do the same.   Above all, have an amazing life!</p>

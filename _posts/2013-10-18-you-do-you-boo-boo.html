      <p>As every Listserve member out there has, I''ve toyed with what would I<br
      />write, well the time has come and now I''m undeniably overwhelmed.  I<br />think
      I always knew I wanted to put some piece of advice, not<br />necessarily assuming

      helpful to me and it''s my email, so let''s do<br />it.</p>

      <p>But, before I get all "self help book" on you, I''ll give you a little<br

      earth, I''m incredibly busy.  Rather than listing my achievements,<br />and
      having you gauge just how busy I am,  just know that if there was<br />a way
      to never sleep thus providing endless time, I''d be the first<br />person to
      sign up.   Biggest fear right now? I will graduate<br />unemployed.  I''m terrified

      <p>Now that I made myself relatable, let''s get all advice-y.  In no way<br

      just sayin'' these things really stuck with me and have made a<br />difference.  If
      for no other reason, I''m just sharing my story, feel<br />free to think "shove

      <p>The best piece of advice I ever received was during a big interview<br />process
      I was going through, someone who had gone through it in years<br />prior came

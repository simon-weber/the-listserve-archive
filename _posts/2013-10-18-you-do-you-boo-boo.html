<p>What's up and welcome,</p>
<p>As every Listserve member out there has, I've toyed with what would I<br />write, well the time has come and now I'm undeniably overwhelmed.  I<br />think I always knew I wanted to put some piece of advice, not<br />necessarily assuming everyone would follow, but in the sense that this<br />piece of advice was most helpful to me and it's my email, so let's do<br />it.</p>
<p>But, before I get all "self help book" on you, I'll give you a little<br />background.  I'm in my final year of college, and like everyone on<br />this earth, I'm incredibly busy.  Rather than listing my achievements,<br />and having you gauge just how busy I am,  just know that if there was<br />a way to never sleep thus providing endless time, I'd be the first<br />person to sign up.   Biggest fear right now? I will graduate<br />unemployed.  I'm terrified of not having a job.</p>
<p>Now that I made myself relatable, let's get all advice-y.  In no way<br />am I attempting to convince you of what you should or should not do,<br />I'm just sayin' these things really stuck with me and have made a<br />difference.  If for no other reason, I'm just sharing my story, feel<br />free to think "shove it" and not take any of my words seriously...</p>
<p>The best piece of advice I ever received was during a big interview<br />process I was going through, someone who had gone through it in years<br />prior came up to me and said "Don't worry about what everyone else is<br />doing- that's way too exhausting and will get in the way of you doing<br />your best".  It really resonated with me and I try to apply this to my<br />everyday life.</p>
<p>I think I'm done now, because none of you have time or are<br />particularly interested in having me send some long email.  So with<br />this, I'll give a quick shout out to Tim S., he's  gem and a half and<br />introduced me to the Listserve.  If anyone in life is going to go<br />extremely far, it's this kid.</p>
<p>Have a great day and remember,</p>

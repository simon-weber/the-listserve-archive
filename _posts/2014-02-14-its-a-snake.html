    body: '<p>I have no insight or wisdom for you today. But I have something better:
      statistics!</p>

      <p>I''ve examined the content of all posts to The Listserve since April 2012
      - thanks to Simon Weber for the archive! I''m not sure whether this is the beginning
      - if anyone knows how old The Listserve is, or who is behind it, I''d love to
      know. Anyway, I spent a couple hours hacking on the dataset with Python, so
      let me hit you with some SCIENCE FACTS:</p>

      <p>First, the average Listserve post has 384 words, and the median has 356.
      The longest of all time was a 1,950 word rant called "Volatile Software" in
      April, 2012. The shortest of all time was a 2 word post in August 2013, which
      simply said "Be kind."</p>

      <p>Here''s a list of the top 10 words appearing in the Listserve, and the number
      of times they''ve appeared:<br />the: 9215<br />to: 7654<br />i: 6820<br />and:
      6742<br />a: 6208<br />of: 5041<br />in: 3720<br />you: 3623<br />that: 3076<br
      />it: 2795</p>

      <p>Well, that''s not very interesting. Let''s filter it to words that are 4
      letters or longer and I''ll pick out the top nouns:<br />life: 874<br />people:
      788<br />time: 709<br />love: 623<br />there: 591<br />things: 540<br />something:
      432<br />world: 400<br />good: 378<br />years: 366</p>

      <p>Next I tried to parse the top locations out of the end of the email. There
      will be a lot that were missed due to formatting (emails that put the location
      somewhere besides the end, or just formatted the location differently). Here
      are the top 30 by city:<br />New York: 24<br />San Francisco: 20<br />London:
      14<br />Chicago: 12<br />Los Angeles: 11<br />Portland: 10<br />Washington:

      <p>Thanks to everyone who has written to the Listserve - I love reading your
      stories and [The Listserve] emails are the only ones I look forward to checking
      every day. Now, here''s a random selection of words which have been used only
      once on The Listserve:<br />antidisanthropomorphizationism<br />ohgeezohgeezohcrapohgeez<br

      \ not an absolute truth, it's just your truth.      \r\n\r\n    Don't have too\
      \ many opinions about other people's relationships - Especially ones of a romantic\
      \ nature. If you do, keep it to yourself. \r\n\r\n    Often people really want\
      \ someone to listen instead of receiving advice. We often know the solution\
      \ to our own problems.\r\n\r\n    Make sure the people love know they are invaluable\
      \ to you. Show them through an act of service and tell them. Even if it is via\
      \ some cheesy e-card!\r\n\r\n    There is nothing wrong with one sided love\
      \ - Just get over that shit sooner rather than later.\r\n\r\n    Refusing to\
      \ forgive will make you fester and rot, and you'll forget why you where pissed\
      \ off in the first place or create a grander version of the offense. \r\n\r\n\
      \    Don't have expectations.\r\n\r\n    Everyone else sucks, just remember\
      \ that you do to.\r\n\r\n    Do a favor because you want to, without expecting\
      \ recognition or even gratitude.\r\n\r\n    Your friends are unique beings -\
      \ So you won't agree on everything. It's ok to get mad, just make sure you talk\
      \ about it later.\r\n\r\n    Spend as much as time as possible around small\
      \ children and animals.  \r\n\r\n    Don't worry about it! Worrying is not going\
      \ to resolve anything besides eventually requiring the need for a prescription\
      \ for Xanax. Though, some of you may be into that. \r\n\r\n    Last but not\

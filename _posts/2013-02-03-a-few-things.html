<p>My 30th birthday is on the horizon and I have resolved that I will never figure this life/ being adult shit out. Life is random and I won't pretend to know a lot because I don't. As soon as I've got it figure out, I get thrown another gosh darn curve ball. Life is often challenging  and my mess is my ministry, so I am mostly grateful that I am here to share what I've learned to be valuable with all of you. </p>
<p>    Here are some things I try to keep in mind every day:</p>
<p>    Don't offer support or advice if you think it gives you stock in someone's decision making.</p>
<p>    Your opinion is not an absolute truth, it's just your truth.      </p>
<p>    Don't have too many opinions about other people's relationships - Especially ones of a romantic nature. If you do, keep it to yourself. </p>
<p>    Often people really want someone to listen instead of receiving advice. We often know the solution to our own problems.</p>
<p>    Make sure the people love know they are invaluable to you. Show them through an act of service and tell them. Even if it is via some cheesy e-card!</p>
<p>    There is nothing wrong with one sided love - Just get over that shit sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>    Refusing to forgive will make you fester and rot, and you'll forget why you where pissed off in the first place or create a grander version of the offense. </p>
<p>    Don't have expectations.</p>
<p>    Everyone else sucks, just remember that you do to.</p>
<p>    Do a favor because you want to, without expecting recognition or even gratitude.</p>
<p>    Your friends are unique beings - So you won't agree on everything. It's ok to get mad, just make sure you talk about it later.</p>
<p>    Spend as much as time as possible around small children and animals.  </p>
<p>    Don't worry about it! Worrying is not going to resolve anything besides eventually requiring the need for a prescription for Xanax. Though, some of you may be into that. </p>
<p>    Last but not least, Chicken soup doesn't soothe the soul. Tomato soup and a grilled cheese sandwich on marble rye does!</p>
<p>Have an Awesome Day! </p>

    body: 'This is really intimidating.


      I''ve followed the listserve my sophomore year of college after my boss at one
      of my internships told me about another listserve about cheap apartments in
      Manhattan, I accidentally subscribed to the wrong one (and wound up living in
      a 2 bedroom apartment in the middle of nowhere Brooklyn with 3 other people).
      Three years and hundreds of emails from strangers later I''ve finally been chosen.
      So stoked.


      I don''t have any life advice to give because I''m 22 and need more advice that
      I can give/ I find it somewhat annoying when people send out email blasts about
      how everyone needs to do *said thing* to reach *said results*.


      I''m just going to tell you all what''s going on in my life because it''s currently
      a shitstorm and what better way of working through your problems than to email
      a bunch of strangers.


      I graduate college in a few weeks and I''m panicking. I''m not panicking because
      I majored in something I love and I can''t make any money with it (which I did,
      no regrets), I''m panicking because there are so many things that I want to
      do and places I want to go and according to my parents I have no direction.


      I have to read Eugene Thacker''s What is Biomedia and write a response that
      is due in 9 hours. I should be working on that instead of writing this email.


      I found out I was pregnant in January, which is scary enough when you are 22,
      single, on the brink of starting real adulthood, and alone, but it was even
      worse when I found out it was ectopic. One of my closest friends told his aunt
      and he drunkenly told me that she was "embarrassed for me because I couldn''t
      even get pregnant right". It might have been the meanest thing I''ve ever heard
      anyone say about me. We got in to a huge fight and stopped being friends.


      After spending my entire college career single, I met a great guy 2 months before
      graduation. I realize that it''s unrealistic for us to actually be in a relationship
      (even though we essentially are, idk, it''s confusing), but I hope it works
      out with us. He''s such a great guy and makes me unbelievably happy.


      I''d never tell him that.


      Better to Best by You Blew It! has been my jam since their latest album came
      out. If you are having a bad day you should listen to it.


      Maybe it wouldn''t hurt to try to be happy.

      Maybe things aren''t quite as bad as I let myself believe.


      Feel free to email me back and tell me how to become a functioning adult.


      Keep it real,

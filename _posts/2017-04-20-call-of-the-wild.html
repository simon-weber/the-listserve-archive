    body: "Friday 21st April is John Muir Day.\r\n\r\nI'm writing to you from Scotland,\
      \ where John was born and lived until he was eleven when he emigrated to the\
      \ USA.  If you're reading this in America many of you already know, and celebrate\
      \ the \"father of National Parks\" and founder of the modern conservation movement.\r\
      \n\r\nHere in Scotland and indeed, the wider United Kingdom, John Muir - once\
      \ little known is becoming more honoured each year.  One of the main reasons\
      \ for this is through the work of the John Muir Trust - a charity that works\
      \ to defend wild land, enhance habitats and encourage people of all ages and\
      \ backgrounds to connect with wild places.  In Scotland the Trust owns and manages\
      \ some of our wildest places and, over 300,000 people have completed the John\
      \ Muir Award.\r\n\r\n\"When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it\
      \ hitched to everything else in the Universe.\" - John Muir\r\n\r\n\u2022\t\
      February 2016 - My family is on holiday near Pitlochry, Scotland and visit Wild\
      \ Space - a visitor centre and exhibition space that shares the work of the\
      \ John Muir Trust (JMT)\r\n\u2022\tNovember 2016 - We become members of JMT\
      \ - I'm looking for an antidote to the Xbox we're getting our children for Christmas.\r\
      \n\u2022\tDecember 2016 - I'm in work (I'm an executive recruiter, my son likes\
      \ it when I say \"head-hunter\") my Director calls out  \"Would anyone like\
      \ to recruit a Chief Executive for the John Muir Trust?....\u201D\r\n\r\nThe\
      \ last few months have seen me get to know the Trust, the trustees and the people\
      \ who work there pretty well; I'm so proud to be a member of this organisation\
      \ that punches above its weight to protect, enhance and connect people to the\
      \ wild.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 John Muir wrote - \"Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken,\
      \ over-civilized people are beginning to find out that going to the mountains\
      \ is going home; that wildness is a necessity; and that mountain parks and reservations\
      \ are useful not only as fountains of timber and irrigating rivers, but as fountains\
      \ of life.\"\r\n\r\nAdd another 116 years of \"over-civilisation\" and it feels\
      \ like we are more tired and nerve-shaken than ever.\r\n\r\nWe're very fortunate\
      \ to live in a village where we can take a short-walk to the woods and have\
      \ a shorter dash for the train to commute into Glasgow to work.  Last night\
      \ we went for a walk after our tea (what we call dinner/supper here) and visited\
      \ the Wee Glen, we played pooh sticks and gave big hugs to a mossy tree growing\
      \ out over a small burn.  It felt good!\r\n\r\nI hope you get a chance to connect\
      \ to the wild this week, if you do and you\u2019re so inclined \u2013 #JohnMuirDay\r\
      \n\r\nWith love,\r\nEilidh\r\n\r\nI've been on the Listserve for c.4 years (thanks\
      \ Sam). The first email I received made me laugh out loud (a story about a deer\
      \ sitting up like a human). I read them all, some I skim and I\u2019ll reply\
      \ to those that move me.  Thanks to everyone for being part of this; I enjoy\
      \ hearing your news, following up on your recommendations and having a wee keek\
      \ into your lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nEilidh\r\nDunlop, Scotland\r\n\r\n\r\n"

      <p>I haven&#8217;t experienced enough supernatural phenomena to firmly believe
      in them, but I like to think that spirits or ghosts can hang around and interact
      with us in some way. A friend and I were in a coffee shop once and this question
      came up, which was followed by a solid hour and a half of intense conversation
      about spirituality, religion, politics, the state of the world, the future of
      the world, our future, what we were afraid of, what we hoped to achieve. I love
      these kinds of conversations, where one topic leads to another and you end up
      with an interesting exchange of thoughts and ideas. Being vulnerable or opening
      up to others can be intimidating, but it''s great when you can share personal
      things and connect on a deeper level. We get so caught up in our busy lives
      that I wish these conversations happened more often (not necessarily a long
      one, but you know, something beyond small talk). How often do you connect with
      people like this? Do you find it easy or difficult to do? If you ever need a
      topic, maybe ask them if they believe in ghosts and see where it goes.</p>

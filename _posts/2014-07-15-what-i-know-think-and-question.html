      \n\r\nI graduated from Yale College in May and am going to start in August as\
      \ a 7th grade math teacher at Success Preparatory Academy in Trem\xE9 through\
      \ Teach for America.\r\n\r\nMy last few days in my soon-to-be-ex-hometown have\
      \ been spent running around to appointments, with quite a lot of familial awkwardness\
      \ sprinkled in between. Being home so little over the last four years has made\
      \ every conversation and interaction with my parents and siblings carry far\
      \ more importance than necessary, and the disconnects and gaps in understanding\
      \ make for arguments that, in the moment I\u2019m having them, feel regretful,\
      \ yet unpreventable.\r\n\r\nAccepting parental awkwardness, but not shying away\
      \ from sincerity I hope comes with age. My 22-year-old brain isn\u2019t capable\
      \ of just appreciating and accepting. It\u2019s crazy how much effort I put\
      \ into speculating whether my parents are proud of me, whether they are happy,\
      \ whether they support what I want to do in life, and whether I am preventing\
      \ them from having \u201Cfulfilled\u201D lives. And what is even crazier is\
      \ how much effort I put into avoiding talks with my parents about any of these\
      \ questions\u2014even knowing that this only makes tensions, blow ups, and misunderstandings\
      \ more common.\r\n\r\nThis week at home has given me a lot of time to reflect\
      \ on my past and soon-to-be future, and I\u2019ve found that most of my reflections\
      \ can be divided into three categories: what I know, what I think, and what\
      \ I question. These may not be related, but it\u2019s coming from the mind of\
      \ someone who\u2019s life is scattered and about to explode shrapnel in some\
      \ unknown direction. Here\u2019s a taste.\r\n\r\nI know:\r\n\r\nThe song \u201C\
      Down the Road\u201D by C2C is the bomb.org.\r\n\r\nRazzmatazz is the best flavor\
      \ you can get from Jamba Juice. Period. Stop reading this and buy the damn smoothie.\r\
      \n\r\nI want a life and career that show people they are absolutely worth something\u2014\
      that they are infinitely and impossibly beautiful.\r\n\r\nI think:\r\n\r\nPete\
      \ Holmes\u2019 \u201CYou Made It Weird\u201D podcast is the best in the game\
      \ (sorry Maron). Hilarious and full of great conversations about relationships,\
      \ comedy, and God.\r\n\r\nFree association games are great to play with friends.\
      \ My favorite is to give your friend two words and have them free associate\
      \ from the first word to get to the second. For example: free and snake. Free,\
      \ Freeman, Morgan, Organ, Pipes, Piper, Viper, Snake. Feel what you feel? That\u2019\

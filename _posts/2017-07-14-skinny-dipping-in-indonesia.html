    body: "I probably shouldn\u2019t have gone skinny dipping in Indonesia.\r\n\r\n\
      It was a bit too late and we\u2019d had a bit too much to drink but there was\
      \ (close to) a full moon a (closer to) chance of a making out. Plus it was Bali\
      \ and I was 24. So I got in.\r\n\r\nThe water felt perfect over my skin, deliciously\
      \ warm and salty and glittering in the real life clich\xE9 way the Ocean will\
      \ be. I danced beneath the surface, allowing my body to be carried by the heaves\
      \ of the ocean\u2019s tide.\r\n\r\nAt some point, however, I tip toed past a\
      \ point where my toes reached the sand and my playful rolls turned to panicked\
      \ thrashes. It became harder to find the surface and I picked up less breath\
      \ with each gasp. The waves kept crashing down over my head.\r\n\r\nWell, tonight,\
      \ I\u2019m sitting in a campervan in the middle of Colorado, gazing at the stars,\
      \ feeling the exact same way.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve spent the past six months living\
      \ in the aforementioned van, traveling around the country in a free mobile clinic\
      \ I dreamed up three days after the election. I\u2019ve met with more than 1300\
      \ people in detention centers and deserts, on farms and family restaurants.\
      \ In schools, churches, ESL classrooms and libraries across the U.S. And I am\
      \ more emotionally and physically exhausted than I have been in my entire life.\r\
      \n\r\nBecause the waves keep on crashing down in this country. I can barely\
      \ keep up. I\u2019m going to guess that most of the social-justice-activists/\
      \ direct-service-workers/ full-time advocates-for-the-cause in your life feel\
      \ the same way.\r\n\r\nSo it\u2019s time for all of us to strip off our clothes\
      \ and get into the water.\r\n\r\nChanging the world, saving the world, is a\
      \ group project now. Maybe before it was ok for everyone to care a little and\
      \ a little group of people to care a whole lot but we\u2019re beyond that point\
      \ at this moment in time. I don\u2019t think any of us want this to ever happen\
      \ again. we\u2019ve got to take little steps, baby ones, to ensure we aren\u2019\
      t all sprinting to our Senator\u2019s office in the future. Avalanches can be\
      \ prevented, lives can be saved, but not if we all wait until the last minute.\
      \ And we can\u2019t keep depending on those we\u2019ve always depended on to\
      \ do the work because they\u2019re drowning.\r\n\r\nI truly believe that each\
      \ of us has a role to play in changing the world, and we can do it by doing\
      \ things we love. TV show writers can shift power dynamics, bankers can join\
      \ boards, personal trainers can give monthly classes at a Domestic Violence\
      \ shelter. Throw anything at me and I\u2019ll work with you on how we can make\
      \ a big shift.\r\n\r\nIn fact, that\u2019s what I\u2019m up to next. After this\
      \ crazy road journey. After I move back to my hometown of Western Mass (reach\
      \ out if you\u2019re nearby) I\u2019m stepping out of the spotlight and working\
      \ to support non profit leaders, social entrepreneurs, corporations, companies,\
      \ career shifters, students, and anyone wanting to make a better world. Email\
      \ me! And if you'd like to send me ways you are changing the world to give me\
      \ hope against the crashing waves, I would love that too!\r\n\r\nSo, my dear\
      \ listserve, my request/challenge/opportunity for you is that you jump in head\
      \ first.  Waves are beautiful and frightening, kind of like life. Dive in, swim\
      \ around, and do wonders with this joyous burden of being human.\r\n\r\nWith\
      \ love, hope, and adventure,\r\n\r\nLauren Burke\r\nLauren@theposslab.com\r\n\

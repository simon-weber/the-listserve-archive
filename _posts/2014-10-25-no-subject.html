      I can&#8217;t speak for every 18-year-old on the planet, but I think this is
      a funny age. You are just old enough to know how young you really are, you are
      full of idealistic thoughts that you sheepishly acknowledge as maybe just a
      bit too idealistic. You still feel like a child parading in adult&#8217;s clothing.
      You recognize that you probably don&#8217;t know all that much.</p>

      <p>So here&#8217;s my question for the community - what did you wish you could
      tell yourself when you were 18? It can be life advice. It can be a story. It
      can be a baking recipe.</p>

      <p>I don&#8217;t know all that much, but I&#8217;d like to learn.</p>

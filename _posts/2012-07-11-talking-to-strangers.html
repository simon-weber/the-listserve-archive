    <p>The United States shows an ever-widening schism between political left and
    right who refuse to even talk to each other, let alone compromise in tackling
    national challenges.  Blogs are hyper-partisan, speaking only to the true believers
    and reinforcing their preconceptions.   Social network tools like Twitter and
    Facebook are great for chatting with friends about inconsequentialities, but actually
    decrease our tendency to pay attention *outside* our social circle.  When is the
    last time you used social media to change the mind of someone who disagreed with
    you about something that actually mattered?</p>

    <p>I signed up for The Listserve to help me think about tools that could enhance
    communication among strangers.  It''s great to communicate to a huge group of
    listeners.  But what''s next?  How could this turn into a multi-way conversation?  What
    about a blog where one random person posted every day but everyone could respond
    in the comments?  With 20,000 people on the list, how could we handle everyone
    talking at once?  What are the tradeoffs between picking a random sender versus
    using social moderation to choose the "best" one, whatever that means?   How could
    this large group work together to map out the pros and cons of an important issue
    and decide on a best policy? </p>

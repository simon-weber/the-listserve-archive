      \ you're not into it, it's hard to keep it going during the hard times.\r\n\r\
      \n3) Build a 3-year plan. Sit down with a financial spreadsheet and build a\
      \ model for your business that takes into account expenses and revenue as you\
      \ grow for 3 years. If you haven't done this before, get a help! This will tell\
      \ you whether your idea is a viable business or not. \r\n\r\n4) Have customers\
      \ lined up before you begin. If you can't convince at least a handful of people\
      \ to agree to try out and ultimately pay for your product and service once it's\
      \ ready, then you should really think about whether it will work. Too many companies\
      \ have failed because the founders put their sweat, blood and tears into something\
      \ no one wanted. \r\n\r\n5) Start. A major key to success with a new business\

<p>There is so much I'd like to say about urban, environmental, gender, and art history here. That's what I'm prone to do as a student of the Evergreen State College. With such complex problems and solutions in constant rotation, at constant attention, there is one thing I'd like to remind us all of: people are people regardless of anything.</p>
<p>There's a song that sums up what I think is a really important and simple idea that French author Simone de Beauvoir brought to life in her novel "The Mandarins," through a Sartre-esque character, which is that, beyond any outcome or decision, people will still inhabit the earth. </p>
<p>Please google the song "People" by Andrew Jackson Jihad (a clever historical name, considering his Native policies and ideas - - relevant to American moralism in relation to "terror"). </p>
<p>Let me know what you think.</p>
<p>Even if you don't, what I want to say here is a (couple) line(s) from that song:</p>
<p>And people are people regardless of skin. <br />And people are people regardless of creed. <br />People are people regardless of gender <br />People are people regardless of anything...</p>
<p>And people are my religion because I believe in them <br />And people are my enemies, and people are my friends. <br />I have faith in my fellow man, and I only hope that he has faith in me.</p>

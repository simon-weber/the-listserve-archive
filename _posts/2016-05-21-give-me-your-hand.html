      <p>Poems I like:</p>

      <p>God speaks to each of us as he makes us,</p>

      <p>then walks with us silently out of the night.</p>

      <p>These are the words we dimly hear:</p>

      <p>You, sent out beyond your recall,</p>

      <p>go to the limits of your longing.</p>

      <p>Embody me.</p>

      <p>Flare up like a flame</p>

      <p>and make big shadows I can move in.</p>

      <p>Let everything happen to you: beauty and terror.</p>

      <p>Just keep going. No feeling is final.</p>

      <p>Don&#8217;t let yourself lose me.</p>

      <p>Nearby is the country they call life.</p>

      <p>You will know it by its seriousness.</p>

      <p>Give me your hand</p>

      <p>-Rainier Rilke</p>

      <p>Tiger got to hunt, bird got to fly;<br />Man got to sit and wonder ''why,
      why, why?''<br />Tiger got to sleep, bird got to land;<br />Man got to tell
      himself he understand.</p>

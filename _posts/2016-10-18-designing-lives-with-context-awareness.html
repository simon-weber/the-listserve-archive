      \ devices can make recommendations set on location, they\r\ncan auto-adjust\

      you&#8217;re all<br />familiar with responsive design, yeah? Design that adjusts

      Mobile devices can make recommendations set on location, they<br />can auto-adjust

      as time goes on, are having<br />less context awareness. Maybe because of all
      the distractions or<br />self-absorption.</p>

      <p>I try to design context awareness into my everyday life. Being aware<br />of
      not only my surroundings, but the people that inhabit it and the<br />feelings
      they exhibit has made a significant difference in my<br />relationships and

      <p>Whether you&#8217;re looking to connect with yourself or someone else,<br
      />context awareness enables you to grow beyond just the courteous. It<br />allows
      you to explore other options, try on new ideas, ebb and flow<br />with other

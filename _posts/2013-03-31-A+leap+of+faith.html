<p>Preface:<br />1. I feel like this is a TED talk for email.<br />2. I think this is one of the scariest things I've ever done.<br />3. I don't like public speaking.<br />4. I don't think I'm a very good writer.<br />5. I'm not apologizing.</p>
<p>The Journey:<br />I took a jump, a leap of faith into the unknown.<br />A month away from my 30th birthday I am on a plane flying thousands of miles away from all that I know.<br />I have two suitcases, my phone and a laptop.<br />This is only supposed to be for 5 months.</p>
<p>For the first time in my life I had no keys.<br />I had no place to let myself into.<br />It was the most unexplainable feeling of freedom.</p>
<p>I am a sassy, queer urbanite transplanted into the glorious, interior mountains of British Columbia.<br />From a city population of 5.5 million to 90 thousand, including cowboys.<br />I'm in a town where people my age and younger leave to go to where I just came from.<br />I live in a place where people my parents age come to retire.</p>
<p>I know no one.<br />It takes me a month to realize that's ok.<br />I'm still reminding myself that it is.</p>
<p>It takes me one month to make a friend.<br />I forgot how hard it is to make friends as an adult.<br />I am reminded of the things it takes to be a good friend.<br />I practice daily.<br />There are many days where I am lonely.</p>
<p>I start challenging the idea of familiarity.<br />I start challenging the idea of personal space.<br />A fully furnished 2-story urban apartment to a half-furnished room in a shared house.<br />I start challenging the idea of ownership.<br />The idea of things. My things.<br />I've learned that they really are just things. Promise.</p>
<p>It took me 30 years to realize what matters most.<br />And, yes I assume it will change.<br />For both of the above, I consider myself lucky.</p>
<p>I suppose this was part of a trend in doing things that scare me.<br />Last year I went on a hot air balloon ride in Turkey.<br />I still fear falling.<br />I got a tattoo.<br />It's not a very good tattoo.<br />Next week, for my actual birthday I am going to go shoot a gun.<br />And because it's my birthday, I'm wearing heels.</p>
<p>This is not a fear of getting older.<br />This is not an escape mechanism.<br />This is not to make up for an otherwise ordinary life.<br />I am not ordinary.<br />Promise.</p>
<p>Everyone asks, 'why did you do it'?<br />As though taking such a big risk is a bad thing.</p>
<p>I took a jump, a leap of faith into the unknown.</p>
<p>I needed to be scared.<br />I needed a change &#8211; something, anything.<br />It ended up being everything.<br />It is not easy - I don't know why I ever expected it to be anything less.<br />I listened to my heart, she told me to jump.<br />And for once, I didn't listen to my head as so rarely do I ever let them talk together.<br />(They almost never agree.)</p>
<p>A month away from a milestone birthday, I closed my eyes and dreamed I could be somewhere different.<br />I ended up here.<br />I changed everything I knew.<br />This is not the first time I've done it.<br />There's a chance it won't be the last.</p>
<p>I can never go back to where I was.</p>
<p>Conclusion:<br />A friend once told me, &#8220;You will always regret not doing something, rarely will you regret trying.&#8221;<br />What have you done lately that scares you? What are you scared to try?</p>

<p>Sometimes, we cannot recall things which we want to recall, and we cannot see a full picture due to missing details.</p>
<p>We are afraid to make a decision since we don't know the outcome, and all this leads to mistakes that we prefer to avoid.</p>
<p>It would be great if our memory was like a hard drive, so we could store and recall anything any time, and if we could correlate all events from the past and see all connections.</p>
<p>This way, we could make no mistakes and precisely forecast the future.</p>
<p>But... our memory is not a hard drive, thus, it cannot work that way.</p>
<p>However, there is something that we can do to improve this:</p>
<p>- When you are preparing to sleep, lying in the bed, try to recall all events of the past day, exactly in the order as they happened, with all details. - If you are finished and still awake - try previous day, and so on. - Next morning, after waking up, briefly recall previous day.</p>
<p>In the end, you will feel the boost. Your memory will improve, you will begin to see the future, you will intuitively avoid mistakes.</p>
<p>But please, be patient - it could take days, weeks or even months, this is very individual, so don't panic if nothing happens quickly - eventually, it will - or money back :)</p>
<p>Just be persistent.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Mojo and I do not have a country.</p>
<p>I hold an Eritrean passport like my father,</p>
<p>but I have never even been to Eritrea.</p>
<p>The country is unsafe.</p>
<p>I am Saudi born and raised, but I cannot live in Saudi.</p>
<p>The country does not grant citizenship or residency rights by birth.</p>
<p>I lost my temporary Saudi residency while in the US</p>
<p>studying at Texas A&amp;M University.</p>
<p>I am in a limbo.</p>
<p>I cannot go to Eritrea.</p>
<p>I cannot remain in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>I cannot go to the United States.</p>
<p>I have been removed from everyone I have ever known or loved.</p>
<p>I have been a refugee for the past two years, traveling as a tourist to avoid persecution and deportation to one of the world's worst dictatorships and police states.</p>
<p>What really matters to me?</p>
<p>Music.</p>
<p>However, I have let my circumstances dictate my life.</p>
<p>In my religious Muslim family, music is considered the voice of the devil.</p>
<p>I am torn between my passion and my fear of disappointing my parents.</p>
<p>We all have our excuses for not pursuing our dreams.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you can relate.</p>
<p>I lost my voice the day I left the United States.</p>
<p>I have been silent for two years.</p>
<p>I cannot live in silence any longer.</p>
<p>My commitment: I will no longer live in fear.</p>
<p>I turn 10,000 days old on February 5, 2014.</p>
<p>On that day, I will kick off my journey to travel the world.  I will release my first music project online.</p>
<p>I may face hardships.</p>
<p>I may face limitations.</p>
<p>I will persevere.</p>
<p>Why travel the world? Beyond an obvious interest in people and culture, the reason I want to embark on a journey around the world is because I need to liberate myself and find a home. If I had a country I would just go to it but I carry a passport of a country that enslaves its own people. My nominal relationship with Eritrea has crippled me.  My fear of being sent there controlled me for the longest time and I finally said to myself:</p>
<p>"If I cannot go to Eritrea, I'll just go to every other country in this world."</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll travel to get my voice back.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll travel to live my passion.</p>
<p>This is what this journey is about. If you want to follow my journey, I&#8217;ve created a blog: mojoyeah dot com.</p>
<p>My email is below. Please do write to me.</p>
<p>I want to know your story, and what&#8217;s been holding you back.</p>
<p>Maybe we can all help each other, and change life for the better.</p>
<p><br />Sincerely,</p>
<p>Mojo<br />mrmojoyeah@gmail.com<br />Jeddah, Saudi Arabia</p>

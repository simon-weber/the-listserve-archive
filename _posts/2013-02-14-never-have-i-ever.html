<p>Never Have I Ever</p>
<p><br />Have you ever held the hand of a homeless person?</p>
<p>I have.</p>
<p>It was dirty, bruised, and scarred.</p>
<p>But it gripped like any other hand,</p>
<p>Reaching out to be acknowledged</p>
<p>And holding on dearly to a momentary connection.</p>
<p>And it felt good</p>
<p>To not be invisible</p>
<p>To not be alone!</p>
<p><br />Have you ever witnessed a hate crime?</p>
<p>I have.</p>
<p>It strikes you down, paralyzes you, and swallows you whole.</p>
<p>But it forces you to shed your naivety,</p>
<p>Arming you with a new sense of purpose:</p>
<p>A desire to look never again into bruised eyes</p>
<p>And utter the lie "it's okay."</p>
<p>Because it's not.</p>
<p><br />Never have I ever forgotten</p>
<p>That the depth and breadth of humanity are infinite,</p>
<p>Extending in all directions.</p>
<p>And never will I ever forget</p>
<p>That we must live through it all;</p>
<p>We must live for it all.</p>

      But it gripped like any other hand,\r\n\r\nReaching out to be acknowledged\r\
      \n\r\nAnd holding on dearly to a momentary connection.\r\n\r\nAnd it felt good\r\
      \n\r\nTo not be invisible\r\n\r\nTo not be alone!\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you ever witnessed\
      \ a hate crime?\r\n\r\nI have.\r\n\r\nIt strikes you down, paralyzes you, and\
      \ swallows you whole.\r\n\r\nBut it forces you to shed your naivety,\r\n\r\n\
      Arming you with a new sense of purpose:\r\n\r\nA desire to look never again\
      \ into bruised eyes\r\n\r\nAnd utter the lie \"it's okay.\"\r\n\r\nBecause it's\

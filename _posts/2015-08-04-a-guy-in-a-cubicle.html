      \ to write about what that was like, but I didn't even know yet at the time.\
      \ It was surreal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI tried again to write after he passed away\
      \ on New Year's Day. But it was too soon, and those moments were too precious,\
      \ and terrifying, to share with anyone else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's been seven\
      \ months or so, and I made it through Father's Day with a few glasses of vodka,\
      \ and today, his birthday, the day after the 46th anniversary of our first landing\
      \ on the moon, I sat on the grass next to his grave and drank a couple of Budweisers.\
      \ We're a Budweiser family.\r\n\r\n\u200BAnd now I sit, \u200B\u200B\u200Bwriting\
      \ about him, listening to Sinatra at the Sands. I know all the words, even the\

      \ of the early 60\u2019s, give his monologue on that album a listen.)\r\n\r\n\
      \r\n\r\nWhen I was born, in New York, my father worked for Grumman, on the lunar\

      \ in front of our tiny black-and-white console television\u200B to watch man's\
      \ first steps in another world. This was one of many things about my father\
      \ that made me proud, caused me to boast. But he would always slow my roll.\

      \ Just a guy in a cubicle. I just worked on just one very small part.\r\n\r\n\

      \ Museum of Science and Industry? Or toured the Kennedy Space Center? Stood\
      \ on the beach in Florida and watched a trail of fire into the night sky? Don\u2019\

      <p><br />For this story we go to the country of Georgia which I visited. At
      some point we ended up in a tiny village called Sighnagi.  To give you an idea
      how much tourism is developed there, the first name of the woman running the
      guesthouse we stayed was &#8216;Nazi&#8217;. When she started her guesthouse

<p>Today I wanted to tell you to have the courage of doing what you really love even if you are afraid, just do it! After 4 years of studying Medicine, just because my family told me to do it, I quit and decided to study Industrial Design. It was the career I've always wanted to do but was too afraid of what might happen, even to give it a try. Now I'm full of excitement and happiness and have zero regrets of taking a chance to do what I really wanted and not doing what some others expected me to do. I guess what i'm trying to say is follow your dreams and whatever makes you happy. Dream big and live bigger.</p>

    body: "One Saturday last summer, I had a stretch of Fifth Avenue in New York City\
      \ all to myself. It was the day of my favorite race, the Fifth Avenue Mile,\
      \ where runners sprint from the Metropolitan Museum of Art to Grand Army Plaza.\r\
      \n            Since I was training for a marathon and had to run 12 more miles\
      \ that day, I decided to go easy. I wasn\u2019t going to race. I positioned\
      \ myself at the very back of the field, knowing that everyone else was going\
      \ to go out hard. After a block, I was completely by myself.\r\nAs I ran, I\
      \ watched all of the other runners get farther and farther away. I wondered,\
      \ what did the spectators and other runners think of me, falling back so quickly,\
      \ going so slowly? Did anyone think that I simply wasn\u2019t capable of running\
      \ faster? Did I look fat? Were people wondering why I signed up for this race\
      \ at all?\r\nThen I noticed another runner on the west side of Fifth Avenue.\
      \ He ran slowly, hunched over, using a walker to help him balance. A woman was\
      \ walking alongside him, talking, but he was completely ignoring anything she\
      \ was saying. I recognized the hard, stubborn look on his face. Focused, determined,\
      \ fully concentrated on each step toward the finish line. I recognized it as\
      \ the same look I have in all of my marathon photos.\r\nI began to cry.\r\n\
      I remembered how I felt finishing my first mile back in 2010. It was something\
      \ I didn\u2019t think I could do\u2014until I gave in to the repetitive footfalls.\
      \ I keep moving forward, one foot after the other until the app on my phone\
      \ signaled I had run a mile. I remember it took thirteen minutes and eleven\
      \ seconds. I felt like I could keep going forever. I had the same feeling during\
      \ the New York City Marathon in 2013\u2014that I could just go and go and go,\
      \ fueled by sheer determination and faith. I knew exactly what that stranger\
      \ on Fifth Avenue was thinking, even though our lives seemed very different.\r\
      \nIn these moments (and so many others), I\u2019m reminded why I run. No matter\
      \ how many races you finish or how fast you are, all runners share common ground.\
      \ My husband and I recently moved to San Francisco, where we don\u2019t know\
      \ many people. As adults, it\u2019s been slow and awkward making friends. But\
      \ I\u2019ve made a few, mostly through running groups. Yesterday, I participated\
      \ in a group track workout with a new friend who just started running. After\
      \ a tough sprint she said, \u201CI\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ever going to love\
      \ this, but I\u2019m trying.\u201D\r\nI recognized myself instantly. I didn\u2019\
      t know how to tell her about the feeling I have when the footfalls take over\
      \ and running isn\u2019t difficult anymore. I didn\u2019t know how to describe\
      \ the sense of love and unity that comes from a pack of people you don\u2019\
      t know providing encouragement at the exact moment you need it to finish your\
      \ first marathon. I didn\u2019t know how to tell her about what happened to\
      \ me on Fifth Avenue, when I suddenly recognized myself in someone else so clearly\
      \ that it brought me to tears.\r\nAnd I really didn\u2019t want to seem weird.\
      \ So I found myself instead saying words that had been said to me when I first\
      \ began. \u201CJust wait. You\u2019ll find it.\u201DI want to give a special\
      \ shoutout, thanking the San Francisco Road Runners and Run 365 for being so\

    body: "I met her in a small diner in Rawlins, WY, called Rose's Lariat.  She was\
      \ riding her bicycle across the country, I was at my family's ranch, in town\
      \ for groceries.  The minute I saw her, my mind said, \"Well, there she is\"\
      .  I figured out a way to let her know I was \"safe\", I asked her if she was\
      \ riding her bike to the Michigan Women's Music Festival.  It was 1995.  Her\
      \ name was Jan Lambertz.We stayed together from that moment on.  She moved to\
      \ WY to be with me, after I tied her bike on the top of my car and dropped her\
      \ off back on the trail, but not before asking her to marry me in Durango, CO.\
      \    Every day I was in town, as she rode, I traced her progress, and called\
      \ the chamber of commerce to find out the motels that were in the towns where\
      \ she was likely to be that night, then called each one and asked for her. \
      \ I managed to get her most nights.  After two weeks of this, she decided to\
      \ take the train back to me.\r\n\r\nWe moved into a house in Laramie, WY, where\
      \ I was a nursing student.  When she got a job we moved to upstate NY so she\
      \ could take a position as the Director of Counseling at St. Lawrence University.\
      \  My children lived with us off and on during those three years.  \u200B \u200B\
      We attended the Unitarian Universalist Church and had a very close community.\r\
      \n\r\nSoon after we moved to NY, Jan\u200B began feeling unwell.  She was pale,\
      \ had dark circles under her eyes, and had a general lack of stamina.  She had\
      \ been the country's first female athletic director, at Evergreen State College,\
      \ and was generally extremely healthy and fit.  Something wasn't right, but\
      \ her doctor told her it was \"just perimenopause\" and that estrogen would\
      \ cure it all.  She didn't believe him, and declined the estrogen, but kept\
      \ going back with more and more complaints.  During that time, Jan and I restored\
      \ a 105 year old Italianate Victorian home.  Jan had a full set of tools and\
      \ had restored homes in the past.   She was quite a skilled carpenter.\r\n\r\
      \nFinally, reluctantly, she agreed to the estrogen, as a last ditch effort to\
      \ feel better, and she had a mammogram to make sure it was safe.  They found\
      \ cancer.  She had a mastectomy and all of her lymph nodes were full of two\
      \ kinds of cancer.  They staged her at a stage IV, the most lethal stage, with\
      \ metastasis.\r\n\r\nWe tried everything, including traveling outside of the\
      \ country, to try to find a cure.  We cashed in her life insurance and paid\
      \ for alternative treatments.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we decided to go ahead the the\
      \ wedding.  At that time, in NY, you couldn't get legally married if you were\
      \ a same sex couple, but our UU ministers agreed to officiate.  We asked our\
      \ friends to bring either food or flowers, and hired some local musicians to\
      \ play.  We bought dresses and rings.  Each day she grew weaker, but woke up\
      \ and asked \"When is the wedding?\".\r\n\r\nThe day before it was scheduled,\
      \ she got very much sicker.  I could tell she was trying to hold on until the\
      \ wedding, but she was fighting a losing battle.  Her breath came heavier, and\
      \ she started to turn yellow, as her organs started to shut down.\r\n\r\nBy\
      \ the evening, my father, who had come to town for the wedding and for my graduation\
      \ from nursing school, suggested that she was trying to stay alive for the ceremony.\
      \  We decided to go ahead with it at home, and called the ministers, who came\
      \ over.  Friends joined us at the bedside, we made bouquets with flowers people\
      \ had sent, someone played \"Here Comes the Bride\" on the piano.  A friend\
      \ made us a wedding cake.  Jan was not showing any signs of consciousness but\
      \ we went on ahead.  The ministers read the ceremony, as planned, and I spoke\
      \ my vows.  The ministers read her vows and asked her to blink if she said \"\
      I do.\"  She blinked hard.  Then, afterwards, when they said that we could kiss,\
      \ she puckered up and gave me a HUGE kiss.  Everyone clapped and left the room.\
      \  Minutes later, after telling her how much I would always love and honor her,\
      \ she breathed a HUGE sigh and stopped breathing.  I could no longer see her\
      \ heart beating in her chest.  She was gone.  I was devastated.\r\n\r\nThe next\
      \ day, the day of the wedding, I put a sign on the UU Church door, directing\
      \ them to our home instead...guests arrived with food and flowers, and I had\
      \ to tell each one that she had died.  We had a wake instead.  My nursing school\
      \ Dean and other teachers from my Master's program I was in at St. Lawrence\
      \ (at the same time) came as well, as did many friends.   Her family, devout\
      \ Seventh Day Adventists, had withdrawn from her during the illness, but came\
      \ briefly after I called and begged them to come see her one last time.\r\n\r\
      \n\u200BAt the time of my beloved Jan's death, my three children were under\
      \ 15.  I did not inherit Jan's two pensions, I did not get any part of her property,\
      \ a cabin on 7 acres in the San Juan Islands,  which was co owned by her ex\
      \ and her (a legal maneuver they had to make when they were together, but it\
      \ required the consent of her ex to dissolve it, and she refused.) \u200B I\
      \ didn't even get any of her CDs or her IRA as it was still tied up legally\
      \ in that same agreement with her ex.  Her ex was very wealthy, and I had three\
      \ young children.  I started my first job some weeks later.  In the meantime,\
      \ her parents came to our home, when I was not there, with a moving truck and\
      \ stole everything they wanted, including nearly every tool in the workshop,\
      \ including those that were mine and those I had given Jan.\r\n\r\nIf we had\
      \ been legally able to marry, I would have had enough money to work part time,\
      \ buy a home, and return to my children wholly and able to care for them, as\
      \ they, too, had gone through a lot.  As it was, I ended up working tremendously\
      \ hard, not being able to be there for them as they needed, and pushing myself\
      \ way too hard.  Marriage is a legal contract that sees to it that in cases\
      \ like this, a young widow with children is not left out in the cold, by either\
      \ greedy exes or by institutions that owe pensions.  Now that I am able to legally\
      \ marry, I will not be subject to this inequality.  For anyone who doesn't understand\
      \ why people would want to get legally married, this might help you understand.\
      \  And for those of you with kids, I encourage you to consider it.  There are\
      \ some very good reasons to get that protection.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading\
      \ this.  The grieving for this monumental love has never stopped.  I was married\
      \ and widowed on the same day, two weeks before I turned 40.  It has not been\
      \ easy.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nElizabeth\r\neevonderahe@gmail.com\u200B\r\nSan\

      <p>Here''s a short blurb from the American RSDHope website''s main page:</p>

      <p>CRPS pain is characterized as constant, extremely intense, and out of proportion
      to the original injury. CRPS pain is typically accompanied by swelling, skin
      changes, spasms, extreme sensitivity, and can often be debilitating. It usually
      affects one or more of the four limbs but can occur in any part of the body
      and CRPS spreads in over 70% of its victims to additional areas</p>

      <p>So if you ever have an injury that is distinctly more painful than it should
      be, and that pain lasts longer than it should, have your doctor look into CRPS/RSD,
      especially since the available treatment options'' usefulness drops off cataclysmically
      after only a few months.</p>

      <p>I''m just trying to raise awareness - this disease is sometimes called the
      ''suicide disease'' as it is not intrinsically fatal - but years of unending
      pain that rates well over childbirth or amputation of a digit on the McGill
      Pain Index - and is ALWAYS ON, ALWAYS CHANGING, ALWAYS SPREADING, WITH NO END
      EVER IN SIGHT...</p>

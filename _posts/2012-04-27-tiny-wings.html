      <p>I want to write about a subject that is very close to my heart - bees! I
      started bee keeping last year, and have two colonies right now. These two already
      managed to supply my family and my friends with more than enough honey, and
      keeping the bees is a tremendously satisfying activity. They smell so good,
      and are very tidy animals, and are just very, very interesting overall. The
      insects'' way of dealing with the world is just so very different from how we

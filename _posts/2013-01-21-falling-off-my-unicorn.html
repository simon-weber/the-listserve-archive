<p>I really wanted to write some big, deep retrospective on challenge and perseverance for my Listserve contribution. That kind of thing is kind of my thing.</p>
<p>Well, it was.</p>
<p>It's what I did, when I started my blog, The Broke-Ass Bride, which grew into one of the top blogs in the wedding industry. It earned me a deal with a major publishing house to write a book about using creativity as currency to rock bad-ass weddings without breaking the bank. (coming this December!) Born as a coping skill for life&#8217;s imperfections, my chronic auto-immune disease, financial struggles and artistic stagnation, I developed a reputation for my ability to spin obstacle into opportunity creatively and with a trademark cheeky irreverence. It seemed like nothing could keep me down.</p>
<p>But I guess the universe watched me leap life's hurdles on my triumphant unicorn of resilience, turning piles of strugglesome shit into rainbows with my magical brand of fairy dust, and decided (in its infinite wisdom) to up the game and see just how much I could take. I had been focused on maintaining my success, so desperate to remain self-employed and free from corporate cubicles, that I neglected my health personal life.</p>
<p>I got hit with an aggressively progressive depression, disease complications and a rare illness necessitating a flurry of surgeries, growing medical debt, and a sexual assault. And just like that, my self-destructive and addictive tendencies took control and bullied my moxie and persistence into submission like overgrown schoolyard tormentors.</p>
<p>I was ashamed and guilt-ridden about how burdensome I felt. Hell, if *I* was so tired of caring about me, I couldn't imagine how exhausting it must be for everyone else. I withdrew from my husband, friends and family, in a ridiculously misguided effort to "protect" them all from my demons. What a foolish girl I was, to believe the lies my depression told me for so long.</p>
<p>With the help of great doctors, treatments, perspective, support, faith and forgiveness, I've begun to find my feet again. Reconnecting with those I've hurt, pushed away or neglected, and trying to make amends. Letting people love me (or not) on their own terms. Grateful for the chance to evolve, painful as it was, into a stronger, deeper, richer version of Dana LaRue: rider of my triumphant unicorn of resilience, spinner of obstacle into opportunity, going from broke-ass to bad-ass.</p>
<p>In an earlier Listserve email, a writer shared the phrase "ad astra per aspera" - latin for "through struggles to the stars." This Wednesday the 23rd is my 35th birthday and I can&#8217;t wait. Not eager to see where this year takes me, but rather where *I* can take this year. To celebrate, I&#8217;m having &#8220;ad astra per aspera&#8221; tattooed on my wrist to honor where I&#8217;ve been, and to remind me where I&#8217;m capable of going.</p>
<p>Well, hey, how &#8216;bout that. Looks like I did end up writing a true-to-form deep, retrospective look at challenge and perseverance. I guess I really am back in the saddle, after all. Yeehaw.</p>
<p>Thanks, Listserve, for the chance to share my story. May it help someone out there through his or her own dark hour. And thanks, listserve nation, for bearing witness. Pass this on if you know someone who might benefit from it. Or share your own story with me, or encouraging words, or drawings of me on a unicorn turning piles of shit into rainbows&#8230; whatever you&#8217;re inspired to send! My email is below or you can find me on twitter @brokeassbride. (And if you&#8217;re engaged, check out The Broke-Ass Bride online and/or buy my book this December!)</p>

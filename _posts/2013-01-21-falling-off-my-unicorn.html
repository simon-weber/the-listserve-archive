  body: "I really wanted to write some big, deep retrospective on challenge and perseverance\
    \ for my Listserve contribution. That kind of thing is kind of my thing.\r\n\r\
    \nWell, it was.\r\n\r\nIt's what I did, when I started my blog, The Broke-Ass\
    \ Bride, which grew into one of the top blogs in the wedding industry. It earned\
    \ me a deal with a major publishing house to write a book about using creativity\
    \ as currency to rock bad-ass weddings without breaking the bank. (coming this\
    \ December!) Born as a coping skill for life\u2019s imperfections, my chronic\
    \ auto-immune disease, financial struggles and artistic stagnation, I developed\
    \ a reputation for my ability to spin obstacle into opportunity creatively and\
    \ with a trademark cheeky irreverence. It seemed like nothing could keep me down.\r\
    \n\r\nBut I guess the universe watched me leap life's hurdles on my triumphant\
    \ unicorn of resilience, turning piles of strugglesome shit into rainbows with\
    \ my magical brand of fairy dust, and decided (in its infinite wisdom) to up the\
    \ game and see just how much I could take. I had been focused on maintaining my\
    \ success, so desperate to remain self-employed and free from corporate cubicles,\
    \ that I neglected my health personal life.\r\n\r\nI got hit with an aggressively\
    \ progressive depression, disease complications and a rare illness necessitating\
    \ a flurry of surgeries, growing medical debt, and a sexual assault. And just\
    \ like that, my self-destructive and addictive tendencies took control and bullied\
    \ my moxie and persistence into submission like overgrown schoolyard tormentors.\r\
    \n\r\nI was ashamed and guilt-ridden about how burdensome I felt. Hell, if *I*\
    \ was so tired of caring about me, I couldn't imagine how exhausting it must be\
    \ for everyone else. I withdrew from my husband, friends and family, in a ridiculously\
    \ misguided effort to \"protect\" them all from my demons. What a foolish girl\
    \ I was, to believe the lies my depression told me for so long.\r\n\r\nWith the\
    \ help of great doctors, treatments, perspective, support, faith and forgiveness,\
    \ I've begun to find my feet again. Reconnecting with those I've hurt, pushed\
    \ away or neglected, and trying to make amends. Letting people love me (or not)\
    \ on their own terms. Grateful for the chance to evolve, painful as it was, into\
    \ a stronger, deeper, richer version of Dana LaRue: rider of my triumphant unicorn\
    \ of resilience, spinner of obstacle into opportunity, going from broke-ass to\
    \ bad-ass.\r\n\r\nIn an earlier Listserve email, a writer shared the phrase \"\
    ad astra per aspera\" - latin for \"through struggles to the stars.\" This Wednesday\
    \ the 23rd is my 35th birthday and I can\u2019t wait. Not eager to see where this\
    \ year takes me, but rather where *I* can take this year. To celebrate, I\u2019\
    m having \u201Cad astra per aspera\u201D tattooed on my wrist to honor where I\u2019\
    ve been, and to remind me where I\u2019m capable of going.\r\n\r\nWell, hey, how\
    \ \u2018bout that. Looks like I did end up writing a true-to-form deep, retrospective\
    \ look at challenge and perseverance. I guess I really am back in the saddle,\
    \ after all. Yeehaw.\r\n\r\nThanks, Listserve, for the chance to share my story.\
    \ May it help someone out there through his or her own dark hour. And thanks,\
    \ listserve nation, for bearing witness. Pass this on if you know someone who\
    \ might benefit from it. Or share your own story with me, or encouraging words,\
    \ or drawings of me on a unicorn turning piles of shit into rainbows\u2026 whatever\
    \ you\u2019re inspired to send! My email is below or you can find me on twitter\
    \ @brokeassbride. (And if you\u2019re engaged, check out The Broke-Ass Bride online\
    \ and/or buy my book this December!)\r\n\r\n\r\nDana LaRue\t\r\nlistservelarue@gmail.com\t\

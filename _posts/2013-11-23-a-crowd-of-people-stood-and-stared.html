    \ those of you reading who feel a young adult\u2019s opinions are invalid (you\u2019\
    re an age-ist basically) feel free to stop reading and go deal with your more\
    \ pressing adult matters (go balance your check book or something!). But I think\
    \ I have lived long enough to be able to comment on some of the imbalance I notice\
    \ around me.  I have noticed in the past couple years multiple cases of black\
    \ Americans getting killed in circumstances that would have been extraordinarily\
    \ different if these people were white. Besides the obvious Trayvon Martin case,\
    \ there was a 19-year old girl, Renisha McBride who was shot in the face when\
    \ she approached a white man\u2019s house after being in a car accident. She was\
    \ asking for help and was intoxicated at the time. So yes this woman was drunk,\
    \ and yes it was 1AM, but what century do we live in where a person would shoot\
    \ and kill a young person who was asking for help? If a blonde white girl, like\
    \ myself (minus the blonde), had approached this man\u2019s house I don\u2019\
    t think there would be a second thought of him lowering his weapon and asking\
    \ the woman what she needed; he didn\u2019t even have to open the door, just talk\
    \ through the damn window! There was another case of a white man following his\
    \ black 14-year-old neighbor onto the boy\u2019s property and shooting him dead\
    \ because the man believed the teenager had stolen from him. The boy turned out\
    \ to not be the robber.\r\nSo America has now created a society where Stand Your\
    \ Ground law allows anyone to arbitrarily kill whoever they believe has obstructed\
    \ their safety. How broad are these assumptions and how can we not see that decisions\
    \ are being made based on racial prejudice? It horrifies me to my core. Furthermore,\
    \ most of the violence in America could be lessened if gun enforcement was readdressed.\
    \ But even after Congress heard pleas from a Senator who had been shot in the\
    \ head and grieving parents whose children had been massacred at their elementary\
    \ school, they still failed to pass any restrictive measures on guns. There is\
    \ some who argue that gun law won\u2019t change anyone\u2019s access to guns.\
    \ I do understand the power of the black market and the fact that there are currently\
    \ more guns in possession in America than there are people. Does this mean I should\
    \ just sit back and come to terms with the fact that I live in an irrational,\
    \ violent country? Well then I guess I will be asking for a one-way ticket to\
    \ Sweden or New Zealand for graduation, because I\u2019m not going to raise kids\
    \ in a place where the people ruling the country are quoting bible passages and\

    body: "I have a secret. A secret marriage. A year ago my husband and I just popped\
      \ down to the Chicago courthouse and said our \u201CI Do\u2019s.\u201D But was\
      \ that\u2019s it, we didn\u2019t share it with everyone else, I didn\u2019t\
      \ tell my coworkers or friends or family.  We don\u2019t pick out colors, menus\
      \ or spend $60,000 on a wedding.  We don\u2019t wear rings, but at home he\u2019\
      s my husband. It\u2019s our marriage.  And it\u2019s turned out quite nice.\
      \  But it did not start that way.\r\n\r\nSee my boyfriend is an immigrate, which\
      \ has left our lives limited in many ways.   We were backed into a corner by\
      \ the government, if we wanted to continue date we needed to get married or\
      \ he would have to leave the country. So many people face situations like this\
      \ in their lives.  A shit or get off the pot moment.  This was mine. We had\
      \ been dating and living together and knew that marriage would be down the road\
      \ but we did not feel ready to \u201Cbe married.\u201D So we filed our marriage\
      \ license and deepened our commitment to each other.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s been a\
      \ stressful year, dealing with the immigration processes and as an American\
      \ citizen, it\u2019s been an eye opening experience. The process is HARD, complicated\
      \ and a lot of work!  I\u2019ve spent hundreds of hours of my life filling out\
      \ paperwork and submitting forms, just to have them rejected and doing it all\
      \ again.  For anyone else that is going through this process, I would recommend\
      \ hiring a lawyer. I was very anti-lawyer in the beginning.  I wanted us to\
      \ complete everything together because I felt it was really important for him\
      \ to take an active role in his journey towards becoming a US citizen.  We had\
      \ a wonderful sense of pride and accomplishment finishing the paper ourselves.\
      \  But with that being said it\u2019s worth the money to have a knowledgeable\
      \ legal professional there for you.\r\n\r\nWe took the leap.  It was not perfect\
      \ and it was never how I expected my life to be but they were the cards in fount\
      \ of me.  And I played my hand. Our relationship has only gotten better and\
      \ I\u2019m hopeful for our future. We fill our lives with love and supportiveness.\
      \  And in our own time and on our own terms we are going to have that wedding\
      \ with all of our friends and family there to cheer us on (the government will\
      \ not be invited).\r\n\r\nWrite me if you have a secret you would like to share\
      \ with me.\r\n\r\nThank you to my dear friend Watson for introducing me to Listserve,\

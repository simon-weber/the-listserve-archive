      \ reasons why.\r\nI\u2019m the colour of a roasted peanut, \u2018caf\xE9 con\
      \ leche\u2019 in Spain. My mother\u2019s side of the fam is Jamaican. A few\
      \ generations up our family tree is a slave who fell in love with a Scottish\
      \ landowner who loved her right back, building a home on his land for them and\
      \ their family. My father\u2019s side is Puerto Rican and my grandmother insists\
      \ there\u2019s native Taino on her mother\u2019s side while my grandfather was\
      \ mostly of (the conquering) Spanish descent. The point is this- where we\u2019\
      re supposed to hate sometimes we love and pretty soon nature reclaims the building\
      \ prejudice is housed in- the vines grow until the cement cracks and the glass\
      \ disintegrates, leaving nothing but a frame for life to grow, take root, flower\
      \ and bloom in.\r\n\r\nMy parents divorced soon after I learned to walk. They\
      \ both remarried and divorced again- one was a peaceful negotiation, division\
      \ and sharing of responsibilities and assets. The other was sprawling, vicious\
      \ warfare that left a crater with an irradiated zone in the middle of my teenage\
      \ years. Not an unusual story, just a painful one.\r\nI grew up in the USA during\
      \ the summer with my father and Ireland for the rest of the year with my mother,\
      \ visiting my grandmother on a hill in the Puerto Rican countryside or lingering\
      \ over curry goat with my Jamaican grandmother and her church music in her house\
      \ in Long Island, getting ready for the house to be filled with drinks and reggae\
      \ when aunts, uncles and cousins came pouring in later.\r\n\r\nWhat I\u2019\
      ve picked up from my family history past and present is how we\u2019re all the\
      \ same. We all seem to be recipes that require the same ingredients: home, safety,\
      \ food, water, love\u2026 (music, books, movies and art I would argue too but\
      \ that\u2019s just me)\r\nHaving had a front seat to three divorces I can also\
      \ say that you love someone by listening without judgement, by accepting that\
      \ everyone is just a person prone to mistakes- lover, parent, sibling or friend.\
      \ Trying to be kind and trying to understand changes everything, for everyone.\
      \  It\u2019s hard work because we\u2019re all a work in progress. Sometimes\

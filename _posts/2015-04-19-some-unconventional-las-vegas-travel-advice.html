      \r\nWhat I want to tell you is how to get an experience for your money, by being\
      \ loose with it.\r\n\r\nHere are 7 suggestions for your next trip to Las Vegas:\r\
      \n\r\n1. While on the way from one spot to another and walking through a casino,\
      \ bet $100, cash, on a table bet, and add an extra $20 for the dealer. Just\
      \ step up and do it. One hand of blackjack, a roulette spin, the pass line at\
      \ craps - whatever. Just do it. No ceremony, no chips, no delay. And no hanging\
      \ around, win or lose.\r\n\r\n2. Buy a bottle of champagne. You can do it at\
      \ a night club, but a less traditional time and place makes it better. Do it\
      \ as your first round of drinks at dinner. Get one at a casino lounge bar. \
      \ Order one poolside. Use room service if you are with someone special.\r\n\r\
      \n3. Play credit card roulette. When out with friends for drinks or a meal,\
      \ do not split the bill. Take a napkin from the table, or a hat, and have everyone\
      \ put in a credit card. Ask the server to pull out cards one at a time until\
      \ one remains. That is who pays the bill.\r\n\r\n4. Tip the maitre d\u2019 when\
      \ you arrive at a restaurant.\r\n\r\n5. Get in a cab, and when the driver asks\
      \ where you are going, say \u201CI\u2019m not going anywhere - you\u2019re going\
      \ to lunch.\u201D Hand them a $20 and then get back out of the cab. Works best\
      \ if you spot a cab stand with no passengers waiting and a small number of cabs\
      \ queued up. You don\u2019t want to take a cab from someone who may be waiting,\
      \ or make a cabbie lose his spot in what was a long line of cabs looking for\
      \ fares.\r\n\r\n6. Group parlay. Pick a sport (horse-racing will do) and everyone\
      \ makes one pick from different events and throws in $5. Buy a parlay card for\
      \ the full amount using each person's pick. You will not win. You will be able\
      \ to tease relentlessly the person who made the wrong pick.\r\n\r\n7. Do the\
      \ \u201Cbill in the wind\u201D stunt from the start of this email. Anything\
      \ found on a casino floor is considered part of the house win, so be sure you\
      \ are off property, and preferably not surrounded by people. Carson street downtown\
      \ can work.\r\n\r\n\r\nChanging your attitude to money can make a big difference\
      \ in how you enjoy yourself in Vegas. And elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteve Grantz\r\

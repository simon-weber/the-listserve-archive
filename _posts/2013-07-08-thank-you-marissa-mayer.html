<p>In the United Kingdom we are asked to make a decision at the age of thirteen that will inform the rest of our lives. The subjects we nominate for our GCSE exams will determine our A-level choices, and then our University nominations and then our careers; which might affect where we live, our financial and social class status, the people we meet and the children we may bear. Asking a thirteen year old to make this decision is reckless. I was told to choose subjects that I was good at and I followed that advice; I studied Mathematics, Electronics and Information Technology, and then I studied Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science before starting my career as a computer programmer in London.</p>
<p>I lived miserably in London for four years. I never made friends, I had nights out with colleagues and partied with the people I grew up with whenever they visited; I never met anybody serendipitously. I didn&#8217;t once take advantage of the city because I was always busy working and commuting. I swapped jobs three years into my time in London and life got better, I had more free time since we didn&#8217;t have fixed working hours but then spent my time at home catching up on sleep because the nighttime noise in Camden Town tends to be filled with sirens and drunks; I&#8217;m not sure that I ever slept through an entire night whilst I lived in London.</p>
<p>In June 2013 I returned to the Welsh countryside, to the hills upon which I grew. I owe it to the sophomoric decision by Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer to put an end to remote working. The owner of the company for which I work had read the news when it became public in February and pronounced it as a disaster, my initial reaction was confusion since nobody at my company worked remotely, it&#8217;s because nobody had ever asked. I asked.</p>
<p>And now? I&#8217;m sitting in a barn and the only noise outside is that of chickens and guinea-fowl. I work remotely, the quality and quantity of my work has increased and I&#8217;m almost happy. The happiness is because I visit friends and family with frequency, it&#8217;s quiet and dark at night and I can see the stars again, everything I missed when I lived in London has returned to my life and the frustrations of my adolescent years spent in this place are no longer.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s just one thing. That decision I made with naivety at thirteen still haunts me. I&#8217;m a decent computer programmer and I love where I work but this isn&#8217;t really how I would like to be spending my time. Despite being a hemophobe with a tremor, I&#8217;ve decided to make the effort to go to medical school and right that wrong. Medicine is my mature decision; and until I start in September 2014 I have the quiet of the country to prepare myself. It&#8217;s what we do that counts, where we do it doesn&#8217;t matter, and a change is as good as a rest.</p>

    body: "Dear people,\r\n\r\nI love reading your stories. You give me the chance\
      \ to share your lives a little bit. To me, this is very valuable. Thank you!\r\
      \n\r\nMe, I am a forty-year-old single mother, about to lose my job. Uncertain\
      \ times. But by now, I do want to take life as it is. I also found out that\
      \ I want to dedicate it to beauty,  connection and warmth. This is what matters\
      \ most to me. Knowing this feels warm and sweet. So strangely enough, I have\
      \ never felt happier.\r\n\r\nI remember being a child and walking home from\
      \ school. I passed a field where a girl was playing. She saw me passing and\
      \ she started screeming something. I could not hear what she said, so I walked\
      \ in her direction; she then came running at me. As she came closer, I heard\
      \ she was actually insulting me. I didn't know her, she didn't know me, I didn't\
      \ do anything to her, but still she started hitting me. I ran away.\r\n\r\n\
      This experience stayed with me. I could not understand why anyone would want\
      \ to do this, and it was very difficult to accept my own powerlessness in the\
      \ face of agression, hatred, lack of consciousness, or however you would want\
      \ to call it. \r\n\r\nOver time I decided to withdraw from the world. I found\
      \ a safe place to live in my mind.  It was a lonely way of living but it also\
      \ allowed me to be close to beauty and far away from the violence and hurt I\
      \ saw all around me. My body turned cold and I never felt very safe. Living\
      \ like this had something very grey and meaningless about it. I connected to\
      \ others in a judgemental manner. My mind was working hard to close off my reality\
      \ for anything that could prove me wrong. \r\n\r\nAt twenty I wanted to become\
      \ more alive. I did all kinds of physical things, singing, theater, yoga, to\
      \ become a bit less sterile. I had children. This opened up completely new layers\
      \ within. To really inhabit the body is a long process but very worthwhile.\
      \ It changes everything.\r\n\r\nEight years ago I started working in prison\
      \ as a humanist spiritual counselor.  There I met very many loveable and soulful\
      \ people. People that grew up in poverty, in environments which were not safe,\
      \ with little love and respect. People with addicted parents. People who had\
      \ to become used to unstable and unhealthy relationships and bad food. People\
      \ who were so bored that they went on drugs as young as they could. People who\
      \ spread violence and hurt in the world and were suffering.   \r\n\r\nI also\
      \ met many people in my personal life,  who were doing well in terms of jobs,\
      \ safety and material wellbeing. But amongst them many who lacked somehow the\
      \ ability to really care, about others, about the world, about beauty, about\
      \ nature, about truth. They emit some sort of hardness and coldness.  \r\n\r\
      \nSlowly I learned to remain present more, and not to react to pain by stiffening\
      \ or withdrawing. I became less of a victim of circumstances, and more of a\
      \ creative force. Very nice that this is possible.\r\n\r\nNow I want to use\
      \ what creative force I have, to further beauty, connection and warmth.\r\n\
      Beautiful things can happen between people. Nobody should go through life unseen\
      \ and uncared for. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy two kids say hi, I say: may you all blossom,\

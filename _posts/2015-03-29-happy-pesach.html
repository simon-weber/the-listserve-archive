      <p>I live near the Hague in a lovely old university town, but I grew up in California.
      Most years around this time of year my wife and I visit family in Maryland for
      what we call Camp Pesach. When I was younger, we''d celebrate Passover with
      my mother''s parents, her three siblings, as many of our cousins in that part
      of the family who could make it (and as most lived on the east coast, this was
      really just an issue for my sister, my parents, and me). Last night over shabbat
      supper, my Aunt Karen recounted what was essentially my grandmother''s dying
      wish, that we continue to gather as a family, and not slip away from one another.
      So each year, Bobe''s four children, their spouses, her eight grandchildren
      and their spouses and children gather in a big house on Chesapeake Bay. It''s
      28 of us this, the 20th, year of Camp Pesach. (For a variety of reasons we''re
      gathering a little early - we allow such concessions as we''re gathering from
      two coasts, two continents, and three or four states now.)</p>

      <p>Back in the early days of this celebration, my sister and I compiled a Haggadah
      (the book of prayers and stories and songs that make up the Passover seder)
      for the family in small ring binders so that we could add new material, family
      photos, and so forth. This year she asked me and my uncle Dana for poems to
      add. I gather that his runs to four pages, mine to 18 lines:</p>

      <p>Wandering, we pitch our tent again,<br />Gathering, our clan, about the flames,<br

    body: "\u201COK, let\u2019s do it.\u201D We sat at the dinner table, excited about\
      \ our latest business idea. A blind taste test featuring different brands of\
      \ common food items, sent out in a monthly mailing. Not the next sliced bread,\
      \ but still, it was cool. The next day we went to the grocery store to explore\
      \ the idea further. We spent 3 hours arguing, and in the end we agreed: no one\
      \ would buy this.\r\n\r\nMonique and I had been dating for 3 months at this\
      \ time. We were both recent college graduates, and we resented our corporate\
      \ jobs. They were good jobs and we had worked hard to get them, but we both\
      \ wanted more. We knew it was angsty and millennial, but still, it was how we\
      \ felt! We first bonded over Shark Tank, and we finished our first date making\
      \ out as the credits rolled.\r\n\r\nWe were nervous to work on something together,\
      \ but knew that we would hold each other accountable. The next 3 weeks were\
      \ spent researching similar ideas to the taste test box. After much discussion,\
      \ we decided on an idea: snacks from a different country delivered monthly.\r\
      \n\r\nWe had $2,000 to get it started. All summer we huddled up in my apartment,\
      \ working nights and weekends to build our website, create our brand, and find\
      \ our suppliers. In October, we launched the website. On our first day we got\
      \ 5 orders, all from friends and family.\r\n\r\nOne night, a month after launching,\
      \ I was surfing the internet late at night, looking for places to post about\
      \ our product. I came upon a subreddit (category of a user-submitted content\
      \ website) called \u201CShut Up and Take My Money\u201D. I posted a link to\
      \ our product: \u201CSnacks from a Different Country, Delivered Monthly\u201D\
      . Then I went to bed.\r\n\r\nPer my usual routine, I grabbed my phone to check\
      \ orders as soon as opened my eyes. We had 30 new orders, doubling our customer\
      \ base overnight. Heart racing, I shook Monique awake and we celebrated. I spent\
      \ the entire day at my corporate job refreshing my inbox, watching the number\
      \ creep up.\r\n\r\nThe next few months were filled with lots of late nights\
      \ and lots of mistakes.\r\n\r\nWe were so cheap that instead of customer boxes\
      \ or stickers, we bought a rubber stamp to put our logo on white boxes. The\
      \ stamp had to be cleaned with rubbing alcohol every 3 boxes, and I had to press\
      \ down so hard to get the stamp to work that my hands were constantly bruised.\r\
      \n\r\nSince we were at our jobs all day we had no way to receive product from\
      \ our suppliers, so we had it shipped to the UPS store. We jammed hundreds of\
      \ snacks into our cars and drove them to my apartment. We didn\u2019t have tables,\
      \ so we laid the products out on sofas and chairs to set up an assembly line.\
      \ We packed boxes for days, backs aching, until my apartment was filled to the\
      \ brim.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s been 2 years since we started the business. Last March,\
      \ we quit our corporate and moved into a small office. A few months later, we\
      \ couldn\u2019t pack the boxes ourselves anymore, so we found a logistics company\
      \ to help us. At the beginning of this year we moved to New Jersey to be closer\
      \ to the port. Now we rent a big warehouse, and we\u2019re hiring our first\
      \ full-time employees. We\u2019ve come a long way, and still have a long way\
      \ to go. But most importantly, Monique and I are still in love.\r\n\r\n- Eli,\

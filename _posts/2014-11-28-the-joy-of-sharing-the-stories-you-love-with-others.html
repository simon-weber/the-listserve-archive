      \nSecond: What books, music, or movies do you lend to others?\r\n\r\nWhen I\
      \ walk into a bookstore or a library, I get an instant feeling of lightness.\
      \ The smell of the books, the quiet movement of people, the light filtering\
      \ in through the windows and skylights. The overwhelming visual stimulation\
      \ of color, shapes, and sizes, bookshelves placed end to end, filling the space\
      \ everywhere you look. It\u2019s a feeling of sheer possibility, of weight lifting.\r\
      \nI get a similar feeling when I walk into a museum or a movie theater, knowing\
      \ I am about to discover something- something curious, something interesting,\
      \ something awesome. Delicious.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve tried to write my own stories\
      \ before, to participate. I get about 3 chapters in and give up. I love creating\
      \ worlds and characters, but plotting a story? I don\u2019t want that responsibility-\
      \ to put in the hard work or make agonizing decisions. I\u2019m content to consume\
      \ the stories told by others and feel a sense of vicarious victory when things\
      \ work out just so, to marvel at the cleverness of the creators.\r\n\r\nI love\
      \ the escapism of science fiction and fantasy, of adventure and romance, for\
      \ adults and young adults alike. Stories have such impact- the alternate lives,\
      \ careers, and realities I can experience through someone else\u2019s imagination\
      \ result in endless curiosity and child-like joy. Even re-reading stories I\
      \ know and love can instantly improve a bad day as I cease to exist for a few\
      \ hours.\r\n\r\nYes, consuming stories is satisfying.\r\nAnd sharing stories\
      \ is, as well.\r\n\r\nI love physical books, DVDs, CDs, etc, because I can lend\
      \ them out to friends and colleagues. Yes, I want them to find something new\
      \ and amazing, but it\u2019s also partly selfish-this extends the story for\
      \ me since I now get to re-experience the joy of discovery through their progress,\
      \ laughing and cringing and remembering all over again.\r\n\r\nTo that effect,\
      \ and for you, here are the stories I lend out, recommend, and often revisit\

    body: "[Ryan Gosling Voice] \r\nHey girl, does your website adapt its layout to\
      \ the screen of the device you're viewing it on?\r\n[/Ryan Gosling Voice]\r\n\
      \r\nNo? Then this relationship probably isn't going to last. No, I'm not talking\
      \ about the relationship between you and movie star hunk Ryan Gosling. I'm talking\
      \ about the relationship between you and whoever is visiting your website.\r\
      \n\r\nBecause sometime after the charm of pinching to zoom and barely clickable\
      \ links wears off you come to the realization that maybe the website is just\
      \ not that into you. That it doesn't consider your wants and your needs(like\
      \ the need to not fry your eyeballs a centimeter away from your iPhone screen\
      \ trying to see a sewing pin-width link that your finger somehow has to click)\
      \ and just isn't as attentive and caring as it used to be. That maybe it was\
      \ just talking to you for hours on end because it liked to hear the sound of\
      \ its own blog posts, and not because there was a connection.\r\n\r\nSure, there\
      \ are more fish in the sea, but no matter where you cast your line be prepared\
      \ for the same tired old zoomed-out pickup line. Only 15% of websites employ\
      \ what's called fully responsive web design, a practice that allows a website's\
      \ layout to adapt itself based on what size screen it's being viewed on. A business\
      \ without a website that performs well on mobile is like that friend of yours\
      \ who never fails to catch a ride home with someone every time you're at the\
      \ bar then calls you up the next morning, whining about how no one sees them\
      \ as marriage material. Websites that aren't responsive seem cold and inattentive,\
      \ and who wants to put a ring on that?\r\n\r\nHowever, just like a man can learn\
      \ (although the ladies may disagree), there is a light at the end of the tunnel\
      \ for websites that aren't optimized. My company, Evadra(visit the domain of\
      \ my email to see our work), provides responsive design to clients of all business\
      \ sizes cheaply, quickly, and of high quality. \r\n\r\nConsider me a marriage\
      \ counselor of sorts for websites and visitors(or customers/clients), and to\
      \ help get you on the road to lifelong happiness, I'd like to offer my services\
      \ to members, friends, and family members of the Listserve at 25% off my normal\
      \ quoted prices. Consider it a wedding gift for your renewal of vows.\r\n\r\n\
      If your website is ready to take the next step in its relationship with its\
      \ visitors, please get in touch at the email below.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\
      \n\r\nTL;DR VERSION -\r\n\r\n- Websites without responsive, mobile-friendly\
      \ design give off a vibe of disconnect with their customers.\r\n- Visitors have\
      \ to pinch and zoom, click tiny links, or stumble through sloppy navigation\

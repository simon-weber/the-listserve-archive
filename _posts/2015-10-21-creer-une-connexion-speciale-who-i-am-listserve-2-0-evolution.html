      <p>I joined the Listserve community few years ago and I thought that when it
      would be my turn to win the lottery I would be in my home town with internet
      and inspiration. Well, I am currently in the middle of the SAHARA desert on
      a mission for work. I have 48 hours to send the email and internet is like an
      oasis here&#8230; Very rare.</p>

      <p>This is my chance to give you 600 words so here I am:</p>

      <p>CREATING A SPECIAL CONNECTION?</p>

      <p>I value human interactions; I love to hear someone&#8217;s story. I sincerely
      think that each life, each story is special even if you&#8217;re not a world
      traveler, a NOBEL laureates winner or a KARDASHIAN. So, I thought I would ask
      if some of you would want to start a sharing group. Whether you are a doctor
      in INDIA, a fisher in SWEDEN, a student in IRAN or an engineer in FRANCE (that
      would be me) the only condition is your willingness to share, to get to know
      each other without judging lifestyles or choices and just to be part of something
      special.  We could share thoughts, pictures, ideas, videos of our everyday lives
      and using all kind of means (whatsapp, letters or carrier pigeon). I love the

      complete strangers and learn from each other.</p>

      <p>WHO I AM</p>

      <p>My name is Mehdi it means &#8220;the person who guide&#8221; (very interesting
      knowing the fact that I never remember where I park my car when I go to the
      supermarket).<br />I have Algerian roots but I was born and raised in France,
      I love being a mix of culture but I feel like an outcast in both countries,
      so basically I feel home when I travel because all I am then is a traveler.</p>

      <p>I am a 27 guy who wanted to create robots then I was hired in a company and
      realize that capitalism is making me become a robot.</p>

      <p>When I was young, I''ve asked my mum why the people are black and white in

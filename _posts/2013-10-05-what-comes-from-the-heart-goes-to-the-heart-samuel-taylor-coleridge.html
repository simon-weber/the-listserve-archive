<p>Today I hope you breathe a little deeper.  You stand a little taller and laugh a little louder; you smile at a stranger and hug a little tighter.  I hope you hear your favorite song, your bread rises perfectly, and just-the-right words appear on your tongue.  I hope a crisp breeze cools your brow this noon and a snug blanket warms you tonight. I pray that love envelops your life and you find the strength to discover yourself.   No matter how high the mountain or how deep the ravine, I am in your corner and on your team.  I am here and I care.  We exist as a world together to defend, not defeat.  And most importantly, to love one another.   </p>
<p>P.S.  A special thank you to my dear friends and family, without whom this life would be quite dull: MF, HF, DF, LF, KB, ZH, CEBH, LP, JL, HT, DK, AP, RP, AC, LP, EL, ND, MS, LM, ZP, SP, FA and so many more.</p>

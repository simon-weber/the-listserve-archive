      \nFun fact:  The odds of someone winning the Listserve lottery in their first\
      \ year of joining (if they joined today) are about 1.45%. The odds of winning\
      \ it within 5 years of joining? About 7.04%\r\nNote:  I make a few assumptions\
      \ with these estimations.\r\n1. If you win once, you can win again\r\n2. The\
      \ approximate 25,000 Listservians remains constant\r\n\r\nIf each person is\
      \ eliminated from the lottery once he/she wins, your chances don\u2019t increase\
      \ by much (fractions of a percent). And I would guess there\u2019s some sort\
      \ of slow exponential increase of Listservians over time. In other words, your\
      \ odds of winning are pretty low and only decreasing.\r\n\r\nOn math:\r\n\r\n\
      I\u2019m currently a math tutor. When someone says \u201CI\u2019m not good at\
      \ math\u201D I always tell them that some people are just more naturally skilled\
      \ at certain things (like math). For those who are not as skilled, you have\
      \ to work hard at it. Saying \u201CI\u2019m not good at (some skill)\u201D to\
      \ me means \u201CI haven\u2019t given this particular skill my very best effort.\u201D\
      \  I always tell my students that because they have to work harder, it means\
      \ they\u2019ll gain a deeper appreciation of that subject or skill.\r\nAbove\
      \ was a general statement, not a catch-all for every single skill. I\u2019m\
      \ a tutor, not a life coach! Haha.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn organization:\r\nYou can\
      \ organize just about every aspect of your life, so why not try organizing the\
      \ time in your life? Try breaking your day / week down into a few different\
      \ categories:\r\n\r\n- Personal health and hygiene (e.g. sleeping, showering,\
      \ eating, and exercising)\r\n- Work (or school)\r\n- Fostering social relationships\
      \ (e.g. talking with friends and family, picking up chocolate for a friend,\
      \ seeing friends)\r\n- Errands / Life Maintenance (e.g. groceries, plumbing\
      \ issues, paying bills)\r\n- Self-Improvement (e.g. learning a foreign language,\
      \ practicing a musical instrument, listening to an informative podcast, reading,\
      \ exercising)\r\n- Me time (e.g. watching your favorite TV show, taking time\
      \ to decompress, enjoying some peace and quiet)\r\n- BoguS (aka BS) time (watching\
      \ an excess of TV, playing video games for hours, mindlessly wandering the Internet)\r\
      \n\r\n\r\nThese categories can change from person to person (especially parents)\
      \ but you can fit almost all your activities into one or more categories. Work\
      \ and personal health take up a large portion of each day and week, so it\u2019\
      s important to cut down on the BS time and try to find time for Self-improvement\
      \ and Fostering social relationships on a daily and weekly basis.\r\nOne activity\
      \ can fit into multiple categories.\r\nAlso note that activities like your commute\
      \ to work can be productive. I read on the train or listen to fun and educational\
      \ podcasts so it can be counted as both \u201CWork\u201D and \u201CSelf-Improvement.\u201D\
      \r\n\r\nFinally, \u201Cme time\u201D is necessary for most people on a daily\
      \ basis. Just make sure that your \u201Cme time\u201D doesn\u2019t turn into\
      \ BS time.\r\n\r\nOn my favorite newsletters:\r\nIf you like the Listserve,\
      \ consider trying some weekdaily newsletters:  \u201CNow I Know\u201D by Dan\
      \ Lewis and \u201CNext Draft\u201D by Dave Pell.\r\nNow I Know is a \u201Cfree\
      \ daily email newsletter of interesting things, you'll learn something new every\
      \ day.\u201D Dan Lewis has perfected the \u201Cfun fact of the day.\u201D\r\n\

      <p>If each person is eliminated from the lottery once he/she wins, your chances
      don&#8217;t increase by much (fractions of a percent). And I would guess there&#8217;s
      some sort of slow exponential increase of Listservians over time. In other words,
      your odds of winning are pretty low and only decreasing.</p>

      <p>On math:</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m currently a math tutor. When someone says &#8220;I&#8217;m not
      good at math&#8221; I always tell them that some people are just more naturally

      <p>On organization:<br />You can organize just about every aspect of your life,
      so why not try organizing the time in your life? Try breaking your day / week
      down into a few different categories:</p>

      <p>- Personal health and hygiene (e.g. sleeping, showering, eating, and exercising)<br

      <p>Finally, &#8220;me time&#8221; is necessary for most people on a daily basis.
      Just make sure that your &#8220;me time&#8221; doesn&#8217;t turn into BS time.</p>

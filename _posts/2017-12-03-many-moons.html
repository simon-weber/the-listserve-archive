      <p>A while back, I won the listserve (in 2016) and talked about my founding
      a waffle iron company! It''s a little silly, and the business is still small,
      but it remains one of the achievements I''m proudest of.  The email subject
      was (cleverly) Waffles.</p>

      <p>A lot has happened in the last year, so I want to leave you with something
      fun!</p>

      <p>1) If you type "fun facts" into Google, you will in fact get fun facts to
      pop up-it''s a Google service!<br />2) Google also has an ''arts and culture''
      section that allows you to look at stories from all over the world<br />3) My
      cats were ''Tacocat'' and ''Purrito'' for halloween.</p>

      <p>May your teams win in the next year (as long as they don''t play mine), may
      the sun keep shining and the world keep spinning.</p>

      <p>Finally, to bring it back-</p>

      <p>Classic Waffle Batter<br />&#189; cup of Milk<br />1 cup of Flour<br />&#188;
      tsp Baking Soda<br />&#188; tsp Salt<br />&#190; cup Sugar<br />1 Egg<br />Can
      be improved with chocolate chips (as is life).</p>

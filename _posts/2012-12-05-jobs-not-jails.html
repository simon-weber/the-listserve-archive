    \ brains not fully developed, who have been abused, neglected, and rejected from\
    \ their families, schools, social service agencies, and society. Some of them\
    \ have made bad choices in life, but often there are not many good options.\r\n\
    \r\nI can tell you with absolute certainty that jail and prison, as they are currently\
    \ envisioned, are not good ways to prevent future crimes. I haven't got the answer\
    \ for what comes next, but I can tell you that the system we currently have is\
    \ broken, obscene, and horrific. I kindly ask you to learn more about this issue\
    \ and tell a friend. \r\n\r\nA resource to get you started: TED Talk by Bryan\

      <p>I''ve dedicated my career to the sustainable business movement. At present,

      <p>How do you make a dent in the most critical issue of our times? Here are
      the most important actions you can take, ranked by highest impact. I''ve used
      a breakdown of US carbon sources to represent global (industrialized-world)
      environmental impacts.</p>

      <p><br />1.  Electricity: 34% of total emissions<br />The main sources of electricity

      you can. If you pay for your electricity, you can request to buy a percentage
      from renewable sources, sometimes even at no cost to you.</p>

      <p>2. Transportation: 27%<br />  a) Flying <br />My work flight to Paris last
      week itself exceeded the carbon emissions of a typical Indian over an entire
      year (1.5 tons). When I can''t avoid flying, I purchase carbon offsets, which

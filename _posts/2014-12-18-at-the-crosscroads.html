      \ I had been assigned to take care of and after introducing myself she looked\
      \ at me strangely and asked, \u201CWhere are you from?!\u201D I told her I was\
      \ born in Flint, Michigan but raised in Yuba City, CA in the Central Valley.\
      \ She smiled and exclaimed, \u201CI was ready to welcome you to the United States\
      \ of America!\u201D I literally LOL-ed! She was the most pleasant soul I\u2019\
      ve ever met...she just had never seen nor met a person with a turban before.\
      \ Not racist\u2026but maybe a little ignorant. But that\u2019s OK, I am willing\

      \ in California currently enjoying living in Monterey Bay while learning medicine\
      \ at a community hospital in a nearby city that serves mostly migrant workers.\
      \ I am at a juncture in my life where I have to decide what field of medicine\
      \ to enter that will subsequently dictate what my life will look like for the\
      \ rest of my life. Will I be a surgeon and cut people open and live at the hospital?\
      \ Will I be a community health doc in a small town that everyone knows on a\

      \ at screens all day and be content with minimal human contact? Will I have\
      \ to move to another part of the country for my training for anywhere from 3-7\

<p>Hello Everyone!</p>
<p>Somewhere, in this crowd of 20 000 people, is someone who believes I<br />can be an important asset to them. &#160;I am just finishing my second year<br />as a Nanotechnology Engineering student at the University of Waterloo,<br />and I am looking for 4-8 months of co-op work starting in September.<br />My work experience so far includes nuclear reactor design for the GEN<br />IV Nuclear Reactor Project, Jr Project Manager for the opening of a<br />state of the art chemical engineering wetlab facility, and the<br />development of a line of industrial chain lubricants for a small<br />Ontario-based lubrication company.</p>
<p>This chance to speak to all of you is a unique opportunity to make a<br />direct request to 20 000. &#160;Send me an email, and lets talk about how<br />we can help each other. &#160;I would love to know how I can help you, in<br />any capacity. &#160;Send me an email and ask me any questions you have. &#160;I<br />will provide as much information as I can, and hopefully this will<br />lead to an important, mutually beneficial relationship.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>

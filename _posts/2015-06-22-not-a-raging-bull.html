    body: "Jake la Motta was rescued from a favela in S\xE3o Paulo, abandoned, unfed\

      \ an acceptable way to play. As far as dogs go, in no way is he vicious, violent\

      \ bulls are vicious animals and unsuitable as pets, Boechat denigrated the breed\
      \ with great conviction, leaving no room journalistic objectivity (Boechat also\
      \ advocates that the best vote is the null vote). Yet consider the circumstance:\

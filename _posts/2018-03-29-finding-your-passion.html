    body: "Hi, all. I am very excited to have won the Listserv. I never imagined it\
      \ would happen, but now I would like to share whatever knowledge I can.\r\n\r\
      \nI will share with you all what I have been struggling with recently. I am\
      \ a 28 year old working as a physician assistant in primary care. I have been\
      \ working as a PA for 3 years, but I am starting to question why I chose medicine.\
      \ When I had to choose a major in high school, I chose biology and pre-med because\
      \ I wanted to help people. I feel that I do like helping others, but I feel\
      \ like I will never be good enough and I don\u2019t enjoy the challenge of diagnosing\
      \ patients. I feel like I just never discovered my natural talents and what\
      \ I am truly passionate about and would enjoy doing every day. I am still debating\
      \ whether to find a job in medicine or science that is non-clinical or maybe\
      \ try to work for a non-profit in some capacity.\r\n\r\nMy advice to anyone\
      \ in high school, college or recent graduates would be to consider your options\
      \ for different careers. If you have the time and can afford to, do internships\
      \ or shadow and interview people working in different fields to feel confident\
      \ that you are making the right decision. I still have plenty of time to figure\
      \ things out myself, but it is much easier when you are younger before you have\
      \ to worry about having gaps in your resume.\r\n\r\nMy therapist says that what\
      \ people should be aiming for in life is contentment, not happiness because\
      \ happiness is fleeting. I do believe he is right and I am still trying to find\
      \ that. A good way to understand it better, I think, is that the grass is always\
      \ greener on the other side, but to feel happy or content, you have to be okay\
      \ with that. And try not to compare yourself to others; I can\u2019t tell you\
      \ how to do this because I struggle with this myself, but I know it is important.\r\
      \n\r\nI live in CT and I recommend coming to visit. There is a lot of history\
      \ here; we also have beaches and mountains, as well as some of the best seafood\
      \ and pizza in the country.Sometimes I wish I could live somewhere it is warm\
      \ all year round, but I do love the seasons here. I don\u2019t know what I would\
      \ do without New England foliage in the fall and occasional snow days in the\
      \ winter.\r\n\r\nBooks I Recommend\r\n- Turtles all the Way Down by John Green\r\

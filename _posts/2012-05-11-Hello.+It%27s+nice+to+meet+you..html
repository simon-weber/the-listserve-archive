<p>Hello! It's nice to meet you. </p>
<p>I have thought often about what I might write to you.  I was so terribly excited to finally have the opportunity to say something to you. You know? To really make a difference.  To impart upon you some great piece of wisdom.  To share some new information with you.  </p>
<p>You have already shared so much with me, and I know that I will be learning so much more from you. So what can I do for you? I believe in treating others how you want to be treated.<br />So, maybe I can make you laugh?</p>
<p>Here is my favorite joke: <br />George: Have you heard the one about the snake in the golf hole? <br />Lisa: No, I haven't. <br />George: Neither have I.</p>
<p>As you can see, joke telling is not my forte. The faces that I make to go along with the jokes is where my comedy lies ( I apologize if I did not use the correct form of that word...it's confusing).</p>
<p>What else can I share with you? I love to bake. I often substitute coconut oil (cold pressed organic virgin) for half or all of the butter to change the flavor profile and perhaps make baked treats a little healthier. I also add a tablespoon of high quality baking powder to any recipe calling for chocolate.  This always adds a lot to the chocolate flavor!</p>
<p>I think what I want to share the most with you is my passion. Truly and deeply, I am an artist and want nothing more than to share art with you.  Specifically, I would love to sing you a song I've written.  Since I can't sing to you, I  thought I could write down the lyrics to a song I recently wrote. You can imagine a melody, write another verse, paint a picture, make a sculpture, or ignore it. Whatever suits your fancy.</p>
<p>"Hey Moon" </p>
<p>Hey, Moon! How's it going? Are you waxing? Are you waning? Have you seen the sun recently?<br />Hey, Moon! How's it going? Are you full? Are you new? Are you pulling the tide to and fro?<br />The stars are shining bright. I can hardly see their light beyond your beauty. My beautiful Moon.<br />Hey, Moon! How's it going? Hanging high in the sky, you hold the secrets to the night.<br />Hey, Moon! How ya doin'? Haven't seen you in some time. I 've been workin' all day long, sleepin' away the night.<br />The stars are shining bright. I can hardly see their light beyond your beauty, my beautiful Moon. <br />Hey, Moon! How ya doin'? Haven't seen you in some time. How I miss you. I want to kiss you, instead I see you in the sky.<br />My beautiful Moon.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.<br />Peace</p>

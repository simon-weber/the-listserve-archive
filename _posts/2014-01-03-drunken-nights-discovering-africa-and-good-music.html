      let&#8217;s go!</p>

      <p>Some of the best things tend to happen in the grey area between the fine
      line of what''s wrong and what''s right. In that sense, drunken nights are a
      symbol for this tension. I honestly believe happiness is defined by the experience
      of contrasts: know the down, appreciate the up.</p>

      <p>In about a week, I&#8217;m changing my uncluttered life in the Netherlands
      for a unique field research project in the outskirts of Zambia.  Nation states
      are the building blocks of our modern world order. Successful ones exercise
      profound influence on the course of world history: international organizations
      consist of states, multinational companies are still subject to state law, and
      every citizen is formally part of a state. Failed ones are the black holes of
      this world &#8211; many of today&#8217;s problems, ranging from poverty to transnational
      criminality, are relatable to a malfunctioning state.</p>

      <p>However, this was not obvious a few centuries ago. There was a heavy competition
      between several forms of ways to organize a community: kingdoms, republics,
      federations, city-states, autocracies and more. The nation state became in our
      thinking about states nevertheless the dominant form of organizing a community:
      invisible constructions with a visible impact, rational in their irrationality.
      The essential question is: how can we understand this phenomenon?</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m conducting field research in Zambia to explore the emergence of
      a nation state: how do a national state, national culture and national economy
      intertwine? I have three months to discover this topic. Excitement prevails,
      since this will be my first research project and steps into Africa. But I strongly
      believe that it doesn&#8217;t matter how many books one can read or documentaries
      one can watch - complex processes are best understood when you can feel them,
      smell them and taste the flavor of reality.</p>

      <p>Any suggestions, questions or help regarding this project are more than welcome!
      I would love to read it: tvanderhoog@gmail.com</p>

      <p>Finally, music. Here are ten songs that are in my opinion very good, but
      not enough appreciated:</p>

      <p>The First Days of Spring &#8211; Noah and the Whale<br />My Body &#8211;
      Young the Giant<br />Put The Game Down - Hockey<br />Time&#8217;s Ticking &#8211;

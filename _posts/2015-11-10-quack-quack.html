      \ people go through life with little to no thought about the food they are consuming.\
      \ Who grew these things? Where did that come from? How was this grown? How did\
      \ this get to me? If people asked these questions, and had genuine concern for\
      \ them, we wouldn't be shipping pesticide laden spinach across the continent,\
      \ when it can and is being grown organically just around the corner. To build\
      \ strong local communities, we have to keep our money in them. Buy food grown\
      \ locally to support local farmers.\r\n\r\nI work as the garden manager for\
      \ an organic farm which provides food year round through several means, including\
      \ farmers markets and our CSA program. Community Supported Agriculture is exploding\
      \ in popularity, which directly connects farmers to local consumers. Individuals\
      \ or families purchase a 'share' in the farm in the spring for about $400, then\
      \ they receive a box full of healthy, fresh, organic produce every week until\
      \ the fall. This gives the farmer an initial income to purchase the seeds and\
      \ hire labour to fulfill the demands of the growing season. And these demands\
      \ are ever present. I urge all of you to volunteer at your local organic farm\
      \ to get a taste for and an appreciation for how physically demanding this work\
      \ is. It may be a form of heaven to be working outside all day surrounded by\
      \ both wild and domestic animals and plants, but the amount of work is immense\
      \ and relentless. Search for a CSA farm near you and buy a share, or go help\
      \ out. You will learn lots, eat healthy food and your farmer will greatly appreciate\
      \ it.\r\n\r\nI've started a flock of Indian Runner Ducks. They are hilarious\
      \ and beautiful ducks who stand vertical like a penguin. They are the best foragers\
      \ of any duck or chicken, and can lay up to 300 eggs a year. They have the most\
      \ colour variation of all ducks including; chocolate, white, silver, mallard,\
      \ blue, black, apricot trout, fawn and others. I recommend them to anyone living\
      \ in a rural area. An interesting fact is that all domestic ducks (aside from\
      \ muscovy's) are descendants of the common mallard. This includes runners, pekin,\
      \ cayuga, khaki campbell, welsh harlequin, rouen etc. I've got five runners\
      \ so far, named Ayples and Banaynay, Cool Runnings, Robert Larmer, Pickled Pumpernickle,\
      \ and Pamplemousse Chartreuse. I love them.\r\n\r\nSo please, think about the\
      \ food you are eating. For our canadian thanksgiving, everything we ate came\
      \ from the farm. Carrot, rutabaga, brussels sprouts, sweet potato, turkey and\
      \ even pie pumpkins for the pie. Where did or will your food for thanksgiving\
      \ come from? Who grew it? How was it grown? How did it get to me? We need to\
      \ start asking and addressing these questions.\r\n\r\nEmail me if you can relate\

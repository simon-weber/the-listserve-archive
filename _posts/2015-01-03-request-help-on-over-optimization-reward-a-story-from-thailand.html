      \ right now I think is behavioral science. But lately, such a focus on optimization,\

      \"Did we lose the trail?\"\r\n\r\nWe look down. What was the trail now was a\

    body: '<p>Hey Listserve,</p>

      <p>I''m Mark Bao. I''d like to ask for some life advice. And tell you a story.</p>

      <p>1. For most of my life, I''ve been trying to optimize things as much as possible.
      Optimize the things I''m working on. Make sure that I''m learning exactly the
      right things, to build the mental structures so I can be different than others.
      And above all -- make sure I''m working on something that I think will have
      the most impact on the world -- which right now I think is behavioral science.
      But lately, such a focus on optimization, and perfectionism, has gotten difficult
      -- in part because I realize that there''s so much uncertainty and I can''t
      predict things, and trying to make sure things work out while not knowing everything
      has been overwhelming. Has anyone else dealt with this? I''d love to chat with
      you.</p>

      <p>2. I''m starting a group of people who are interested in psychology, thoughtful
      topics, life-long learning, and understanding things on a deeper level. If you
      read Farnam Street or Raptitude or Less Wrong or are interested in understanding
      behavior and improving personal growth, it would be rad to have you in the group!
      Just shoot me an email. The goal is to have a collaborative discussion among
      thoughtful people trying to make the world a better place.</p>

      <p>And now a story. Northwest Thailand. During my round-the-world trip. T and
      I decide to take a day hike into a valley, between two mountains, to a waterfall,
      crossing a river a few times, climbing boulders, walking through idyllic paths
      through damp forests and brushes teeming with weird bugs we''ve never seen before.</p>

      <p>We get to the waterfall, and eat our sandwiches in victory. 3 hours to sundown
      - just enough time to get back home before things go dark. But when it does
      go dark... It gets below zero. If you stayed in the valley, things aren''t looking
      great for you. We had no more food. No water. Hiking in shorts and a t-shirt.
      No worries, plenty of time to go.</p>

      <p>Walking back, T spots an upper trail. I''m thrilled -- I hate backtracking
      and always like to take new trials. We walk up and see a whole new view of the
      valley, almost reaching the top of the mountain. But...</p>

      <p>"Hey, T?"</p>

      <p>"Yeah?"</p>

      <p>"Did we lose the trail?"</p>

      <p>We look down. What was the trail now was a few leaves on the ground.</p>

      <p>"Uh, weird."</p>

      <p>1.5 hours to go before sundown. We tried backtracking, trying to find the
      leaves on the ground we followed before. It was all shrubs and trees and weird
      bugs.</p>

      <p>Nothing.</p>

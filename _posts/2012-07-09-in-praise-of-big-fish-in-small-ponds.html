      \_\r\nI'm not famous. I'll never be famous.\r\n\_\r\nBut I have always aspired\
      \ to be 'someone', a person who made some kind of small but significant contribution\
      \ to 'something' . As it happened, I found such a modest niche. I'm a sociologist,\
      \ working on two very specialised areas - the sociology of hevy metal and the\
      \ sociology of the British Jewish community. Needless to say, there aren't many\
      \ of us working in either area. I'm really just a reasonably big fish in a couple\
      \ of pretty small ponds.\r\n\_\r\nSo for the last few years I've made a joke\
      \ about being such a big fish in a small pond. I've said that really I'm just\
      \ like 'the best water skier in Luxembourg'. Needless to say I didn't know anything\
      \ about water skiing in Luxembourg.\r\n\_\r\nBut about a year ago I had a brianstorm:\
      \ why not go and meet the best water skier in Luxembourg? Why not write a book\
      \ about him/her and about other big fish in small ponds too? The idea seized\
      \ me with excitement. This could be a polemic against power and celebrity, a\
      \ celebration of the unknown heroes in obscure small worlds, a tribute to commitment\
      \ and community.\r\n\_\r\nSo I've been working on the book. I actually met the\
      \ best water skier in Luxembourg last year and I'm preparing further trips to\
      \ visit such other obscure figures as the Icelandic special forces, the top\
      \ novelist in Suriname and the best heavy metal band in Botswana.\r\n\_\r\n\
      The book is being crowd-funded so I need the help of strangers to complete my\
      \ project. You can't post links on The Listserve but if you google 'best water\
      \ skier in Luxembourg' or e-mail me, you can find out more.\r\n\_\r\nIn the\
      \ meantime thank you to The Listerserve for making me a little bit famous for\
      \ one e-mail.\r\n\_\r\nYours\r\n\_\r\nKeith Kahn-Harris\r\nLondon, UK\r\nkkahnharis@yahoo.co.uk\r\

      <p>time after time <br />you brought me silence<br />and water for the lilies
      I held deep </p>

      <p>time after time <br />I used to peer out into the darkness<br />fingertips
      against the windowpane<br />from a room well lit </p>

      <p>time after time I am proven wrong <br />stories do become flesh<br />and
      the lilies do turn white</p>

      <p>Remember - things most likely will turn out okay. </p>

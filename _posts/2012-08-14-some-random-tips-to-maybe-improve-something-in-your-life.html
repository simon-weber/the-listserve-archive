<p>Dear Listservers,</p>
<p>I'm still figuring out how a lot of stuff works in life. I like to think that I get it right most of the times, but of course I fuck up a lot too.</p>
<p>I believe that's what it means to be human.</p>
<p>Here are some random tips/insights I've had that will hopefully improve your life or either give you something to think about, they did for me.</p>
<p>1) A clean house is one of the best things, but sometimes seems an impossible task. Just set out to de-clutter a little bit each day. I started by making my bed every morning, it only takes 5 minutes, but drastically improves the room. A mini-challenge: I'd like you to stop whatever you're doing right now, and clear off the nearest surface (be it a kitchencounter or desk) for the next 15 minutes&#8230; Go!</p>
<p>2) When people do shitty things and you call them out on their behavior, it's OK when it feels uncomfortable. The boundary you set makes them experience negative emotions and that is allright.<br />- Likewise, if someone calls you out on your behavior, own your negative emotions. Apologize and allow yourself to feel shitty. No-one is a pro on how to interact with everyone. Rule of thumb: Don't do to others what you wouldn't like happening to yourself.</p>
<p>3) Love the people you love. Let them know that you care about them. Make it a point to let someone know today. And when you do someone a favor, don't expect anything in return, that's what favors are.  Olympia, WA, USA</p>

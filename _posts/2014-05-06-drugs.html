      won\u2019, so I\u2019ll revert to what I know best \u2013 drugs \u2013 the medicinal\
      \ type. I\u2019m a 26 year old intern pharmacist from NSW, Australia and I thought\
      \ I\u2019d list a few interesting things, common misconceptions and general\
      \ things to know about medicines.\r\n\r\n**Disclaimer \u2013 I\u2019m still\
      \ learning, don\u2019t just take my word for the following (or the news, or\
      \ anything); look into things for yourself, and become informed. The world will\
      \ be a better place for it!\r\n\r\n\r\n1.       Are you one of those people\
      \ (I\u2019m guilty) that takes pain killers only when you can\u2019t bear the\
      \ pain any longer? It turns out that this is not ideal. \u2018Central sensitisation\u2019\
      \ is when you experience (chronic) pain above a critical rate over time, leading\
      \ to your perception of the pain increasing i.e. the longer you leave the pain\
      \ \u2013 the more sensitive you become to it \u2013 so treat it early and regularly\
      \ if required!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.       Medications come from many sources, especially\
      \ natural ones. A new diabetes drug, exenetide is derived from saliva of a lizard.\
      \ Penicillin comes from Penicillium fungus; digoxin is extracted from the foxglove\
      \ plant, morphine from opium etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.       The difference between\
      \ paracetamol/acetaminophen (brand \u2013 Panadol) and ibuprofen (brand Nurofen).\
      \ Paracetamol an analgesic (kills pain) that also reduces fever, is effective\
      \ if taken regularly, however, if overused can damage the liver. Ibuprofen an\
      \ anti-inflammatory - reduces inflammation, thereby reducing pain \u2013 can\
      \ hurt the stomach if not taken with food.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.       Generics\
      \ \u2013 these are the cheaper options offered to you at the pharmacy. These\
      \ products must by law contain EXACTLY the same active ingredient (drug) and\
      \ be as effective as the original medication. The only difference is that they\
      \ may have different non-active ingredients like colourings etc. Often these\
      \ are made by the same company as the original brand \u2013 it\u2019s all about\
      \ creating the competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.       Marketing \u2013 don\u2019\
      t let the drug companies fool you with \u2018Migraine\u2019, or \u2018Period\
      \ Pain\u2019 tablets. Look at the active ingredient and you will probably find\
      \ they all contain the same drug in the same strength, the only difference being\
      \ the price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.       Ever wondered why pharmacists preach that\
      \ you must take the full course of antibiotics, even if you feel better? It\u2019\
      s to do with survival of the fittest, if you take an antibiotic for half the\
      \ course, you\u2019ll kill the weaker bacteria. But the stronger bacteria that\
      \ can deal with the drug will survive and this will become the norm. This cycle\
      \ perpetuates, leading to resistance to an antibiotic and is how we get super\
      \ bugs like Staph (MRSA) that don\u2019t respond well to treatment. Taking the\
      \ full course aims to eliminate all of the bacteria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7.     \
      \   Antibiotics and alcohol \u2013 whilst it\u2019s not advisable to drink much\

      \ I spend a lot of time looking like a scared chihuahua. Shaking. Panicky. Awkward.\r\
      \n\r\nThe hardest part is that certain people seem wired to zero in on my exact\

      <p>Autism is a difficult concept to grasp unless you''re living with it or dealing
      with someone close to you who has it. Most people are quite uncertain about
      what it actually is; they just know that it''s something really, really bad.
      That''s because autism is a very wide spectrum, and it''s nearly impossible
      to paint an accurate picture with just a short definition or soundbyte.<br />So
      I''d like to paint a picture of what autism looks like for me.</p>

      <p>I''ve always been "different." Quirky. Odd. When I was a baby, I crawled
      backwards. I''m hyperlexic; I started reading at age 2 (yes - really).</p>

      <p>Before I was diagnosed, I used to say that I felt like I was "born without
      skin." You know how, if you hurt yourself and abrade away the outermost layer
      of your skin, suddenly even the tiniest touch is excruciating? That wound might
      not look like much to others, but it sure hurts like hell. That''s kinda what
      autism is like for me.</p>

      <p>Everything about me is like that abraded patch of skin. If you can imagine
      the outside of your entire body, every inch, lacking that protective outer layer
      of skin, perhaps you can imagine the level of anxiety that would create, all
      the time.</p>

      <p>As you might imagine, I spend a lot of time looking like a scared chihuahua.
      Shaking. Panicky. Awkward.</p>

      <p>The hardest part is that certain people seem wired to zero in on my exact
      kinds of vulnerabilities and relish exploiting them. Those are the people who
      make having autism really, really hard.</p>

      is that you be understanding of others'' challenges and quirks. Allow everyone

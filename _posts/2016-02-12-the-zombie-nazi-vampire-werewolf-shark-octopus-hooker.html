      \n \r\nSome Background:  Before we had socialized healthcare, we had Reagan's\

      \ American cheesefood product was mass produced and said to have contained a\
      \ scrappy mixture of various different cheeses, emulsifiers, and preservatives.\
      \   In the 1980's stockpiles of dairy surplus got so large that the cheese supply\
      \ was in danger of spoilage, so the Reagan administration decided to distribute\
      \ free processed cheese to the nation's needy families.  Apparently the subsidy\
      \ program that funded cheese and butter blocks ended in the 90's. \r\n \r\n\
      To tell you that government cheese was delicious would be an understatement.\
      \  As an adult, I've eaten at a number of renowned restaurants including the\
      \ French Laundry where I dined on truffle mac and cheese made from the milk\
      \ of a single cow and sprinkled with a trio of tasting salts from the time of\

      \ between pretentious macaroni or a plain-ass poverty sandwich, I'd take the\
      \ nostalgia sandwich.  Most seem to agree that it was most like Colby.....which\
      \ I'm not too sure about. \r\n \r\nIn many ways, I feel like this historical\

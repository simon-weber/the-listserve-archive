    body: "A week ago, I went through an amicable yet extremely painful breakup.\r\
      \n\r\nWe\u2019re young, we were each other\u2019s first significant other, and\
      \ we had been dating 4 years. She was worried she was missing what else is out\
      \ there\u2014that she\u2019d be 40 and wake up realizing she\u2019d committed\
      \ too early. I tried to convince her to stay, but I recognize she\u2019s right,\
      \ and I\u2019m crazy for being willing to ignore any of those doubts myself.\r\
      \n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t make it easier to lose her, though. There really is no\
      \ one else in the world like her.\r\n\r\nI know breaking up is the standard\
      \ stuff of being 20-something, but it\u2019s hard not to feel like it\u2019\
      s exceptional. Maybe that\u2019s just because it\u2019s personal, so I know\
      \ the all the details of what I\u2019m losing, the small things you usually\
      \ don\u2019t see in stories, like her calling me excited with moments she can\u2019\
      t wait to share, me sending her goodnight messages, us using silly pet names...\
      \ There are sad moments where I get excited to tell her something and then remember\
      \ I can\u2019t.\r\n\r\nThe past week has been a lot: random memories stabbing\
      \ at my heart, moments of ridiculous optimism, regret over every time I let\
      \ her down, an Avett Brothers and Fleetwood Mac playlist, fear of the future,\
      \ blank stares into space, and reflection on my life.\r\n\r\nAt this point,\
      \ I\u2019m becoming okay. All this has also rekindled my spirit. It\u2019s reminded\
      \ me of all the great things I\u2019m planning to do, but had forgotten being\
      \ comfortable. Someone a couple years back sent out a message titled \u201C\
      Plan secretly and without respite.\u201D Find the quoted passage online\u2014\
      I\u2019m no anarchist, but that speaks to exactly how I\u2019m feeling.\r\n\r\
      \nMy new plans are being laid. I know things will be different in the future\
      \ and they\u2019ll be ok, even if there\u2019s a space left behind. I\u2019\
      m in tech currently, but eventually want to get into storytelling of some kind.\
      \ Time to start exploring.\r\n\r\nFor now, though, the roller coaster will continue.\
      \ I\u2019m visiting our college for a career fair in a couple weeks. I\u2019\
      ll walk past the places where we met, had our first date, had our first kiss.\
      \ Her ghost will be everywhere. It\u2019ll suck, but it\u2019ll also probably\

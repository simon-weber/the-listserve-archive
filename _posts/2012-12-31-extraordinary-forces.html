  body: "I want to share a short story with all of you. A short fantasy story with\
    \ a true heart and message, written by myself many a year ago, when my life was\
    \ much more complicated, restless and chaotic. I wrote this one for a close friend\
    \ who needed a positive message at the time, but now, looking back at it all,\
    \ I think I could've just as easily have written it for myself. Since then, you\
    \ should know, my state of being has been transformed from being unsure, insecure\
    \ and unaware, to being genuinely happy, secure, cognizant and reasonably untroubled.\
    \ How, you might ask? Well, it turned out to be fairly simply / incredibly difficult:\
    \ by finding true love and by finding (part of) my true self...\r\n\r\n********\r\
    \n\r\nChacaroc\u2019hcracha-cocrochy lived in an old abandoned gnome dwelling\
    \ at the foot of a ridiculously gigantic and, in addition, awfully ancient oak\
    \ tree, covered in strange smelling dark greenish mold. Chacaroc\u2019hcracha-cocrochy\
    \ (I\u2019m really terribly sorry, but that\u2019s just what she was called) looked\
    \ very much like a cockroach, but, to be honest, she actually wasn\u2019t one\
    \ and, for that matter, never had been one either. She herself had no idea though,\
    \ of what she actually was and why she did look like what she looked like. No\
    \ idea about the extraordinary forces that quietly bubbled within her either.\r\
    \n\r\nThe thing is, Chacaroc\u2019hcracha-cocrochy was in fact the only existing\
    \ creature in existence that perceived Chacaroc\u2019hcracha-cocrochy as an \u2018\
    ugly creepy crawly creeper\u2019, as she indeed often mumblingly referred herself\
    \ to. Obviously, there was no one around to tell her otherwise, being the only\
    \ Earthborn in that particular part of the forest (throughout that particular\
    \ span of time that we now so whimsically, or rather ironically, denote as \"\
    Origin\" or \"Chacaroc\u2019hcracha-cocrochy\").\r\n\r\nYes, this is true; she\
    \ had once met Garwocketwicket, Garwocketwicket the gnome. He was a surprisingly\
    \ mute gnome, however, only able to communicate with birds (or other animals with\
    \ beaks that whistled) by mimicking their cries and colourful tunes, simultaneously\
    \ flapping his arms and legs. A strange sight for some perhaps, but Chacaroc\u2019\
    hcracha-cocrochy, by her very nature, understood immediately and perfectly that\
    \ a gnome being a mute gnome, communicating with birds and at the same time comically\
    \ flapping his limbs, probably was the most beautiful spectacle she would ever\
    \ had the privilege to witness.\r\n\r\nNever before had mute creatures told Chacaroc\u2019\
    hcracha-cocrochy that she was not what she thought she was. Neither did Garwocketwicket,\
    \ nor did he want to if he could have done so. Which is to say, not in a direct\
    \ or literal manner at any rate. As an owlish gnome of strong character and stupendous\
    \ wisdom he kept himself to flapping his arms and legs, creating beautiul spectacles\
    \ and letting Chacaroc\u2019hcracha-cocrochy be Chacaroc\u2019hcracha-cocrochy.\
    \ Knowing she would undoubtedly one day see herself as her true self, knowing\
    \ that she would one day see and feel the extraordinary forces that so quietly\
    \ bubbled within her.\r\n\r\n********\r\n\r\nAs an aspiring writer, this kind\
    \ of opportunity - possibly being read by literally thousands and thousands of\
    \ Listserve members - is truly a once in a lifetime thing. So, thank you all for\
    \ your time and attention.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions or comments, then, please,\

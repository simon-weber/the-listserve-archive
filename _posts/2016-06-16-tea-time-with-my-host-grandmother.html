    body: "\"I\xB4m sick in my bones, they tell me I will die in about a year\" she\
      \ told me as she took another drag from her cigarette and her eyes drifted back\
      \ to her telenovela (\"Terra Nostra\" in case you\xB4re wondering).\r\n\r\n\
      \                 My name is Alexis Rinck, I\xB4m 20 years old and studying\
      \ abroad in Santiago, Chile...and I did not know how to respond to what this\
      \ woman had  told me. You can take all the spanish classes at your university\
      \ but I swear, none of them will prepare you with the vocabulary to express\
      \ remorse, compassion, or sorrow needed for a situation like that. Instead,\
      \ I sat there and looked at her with a sad look on my face and sipped my tea,\
      \ wondering if I had understood her correctly. But I knew I did. Since I\xB4\
      ve been here, I have only seen her cough more and more every day, talk about\
      \ more and more aches and pains, get out of bed less, eat less, and smile less.\r\
      \n\r\n                Studying abroad is an incredible privilege, and I know\
      \ for many of my classmates it had meant drinking a lot and partying. Frankly,\
      \ I thought I would be doing more of that. But the closer I got to this woman,\
      \ the more I looked forward to coming home early, walking into her kitchen,\
      \ seeing her shoot me a huge smile  and ask if I want to drink tea with her\
      \ and watch soap operas. Which really begs the question, why? I\xB4m 20 and\
      \ in a foreign country but I\xB4m spending significant amounts of time with\
      \ someone four times my age who barely speaks.\r\n\r\n                 When\
      \ I was 16, I was ready for it all to be over. After childhood sexual abuse,\
      \ verbal and physical abuse, a sexual assault in high school, and abusive relationships,\
      \ I felt as if I couldn\xB4t take it anymore. Self harming by 8, cutting by\
      \ 15, suicidal by 16. Me, the honors student, band geek, teacher\xB4s pet, wrote\
      \ suicide notes in class and spent time trying to figure what would be the best\
      \ way to off myself. It took me losing one of my closest friends to suicide\
      \ a week after my own failed (clearly) suicide attempt to want to change my\
      \ life.\r\n\r\n                A quick note for those of you out there who feel\
      \ alone, depressed, suicidal, I just want to tell you it gets so much better.\
      \ I know if I was told that back in the day I would have punched that person.\
      \ But, I got out of that small town, went to college, found my passion, and\
      \ I\xB4m currently finding myself.\r\n\r\nBut that\xB4s not the point of this\
      \ message. I am a constant work in progress and by no means an inspiration.\
      \ There are days I falter, fall back into that depression, and want to fall\
      \ off a cliff.\r\n\r\nHowever, this woman, this elderly Chilean woman somehow\
      \ represents three things to me.\r\n\r\n1. She makes me appreciate life and\
      \ reminds me to get out an enjoy my youth while I can. Because of her hands,\
      \ she can no longer sew. Sewing was her passion and hobby. She can\xB4t leave\
      \ the house on her own and hardly does. Instead she sits inside all day, smokes\
      \ cigarettes and watches TV. When I look at her, I can\xB4t help but wonder\
      \ if that will be me someday.\r\n\r\n2. She reminds me how those we love can\
      \ leave at any moment. I drink tea with her everyday as if it is our last.\r\
      \n\r\n3. She represents to me the beauty of a full life. Her living room is\
      \ filled with pictures of children, grandchildren, old pets and old friends.\
      \ This woman lived through the Chilean dictatorship and lived to see freedom.\
      \ She has lived such a fulfilled and beautiful life that she does not fear her\
      \ death and has accepted it. In that sense, I hope someday to be like her.\r\
      \n\r\nI'm still figuring it out, I think we all are. So figure it out with me:\

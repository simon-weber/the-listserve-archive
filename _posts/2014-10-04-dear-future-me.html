      <p>Dear Future Hanna,</p>

      <p>Right now you plan to study computer science with a minor in women''s studies,
      then go on to get a master''s in library science in order to become a librarian.
      I don''t see you changing your mind as you love books and believe in the power
      of public libraries. I only hope you are able to find work in a community you
      love. </p>

      <p>Where are you living? Seattle still, or elsewhere? Where have you decided
      to get your Master''s Degree? I hope it''s somewhere back east or the southwest.
      Have you visited any other countries? What did you learn? How is the family;
      Dad, with his alcoholism, Jess with a job or college, Katie halfway through
      high school, and is mom still living in Rogue River? What do you regret not
      doing?</p>

      <p>I hope you keep your wonder for nature and enjoyment of geeky things. I do
      hope however, that you learn better patience and to not be so anxious.  I hope
      you feel more belonging at SPU than you did at Rogue River High School, and
      have the courage to branch out of your comfort zone. I hope you make wonderful
      friends and maybe even fall in love. I hope you learn to better forgive and
      be vulnerable. I hope you read some wonderful books and attend a few concerts.
      Stay thankful, optimistic, and independent. Don''t forget to make a few mistakes
      (but learn from them).</p>

      <p>Treat yourself and others gently (especially Mom).</p>

      <p><br />With love,</p>

      <p>Anything I should have added? Have any funny/interesting/educational stories
      about your own process becoming a full-fledged adult? Want to share a favorite
      book or song? Shoot me an e-mail!</p>'

      \ to write about my list of very important things everyone should know about\
      \ technology, but yesterday I found out that my dog, Petra, has a very large\
      \ abdominal mass, and we're not sure how much longer she'll survive. So instead\
      \ of a bunch of important things you really should know about technology, I'm\
      \ going to tell you about my dog:\r\n\r\nWe got Petra when she was 11 months\
      \ old, from the Oregon Humane Society. She was a 60+ pound boxer/ridgeback (listed\
      \ as a Lab mix??), and whoever was doing intake was naming all the female dogs\
      \ after Disney princesses, so her name was \"Jasmine.\" She was obviously not\
      \ a Jasmine. She won us over by destroying a squeaky toy, then climbing (literally)\
      \ into our laps.\r\n\r\nNeither my girlfriend (now wife) nor I had owned a dog\
      \ before, and we brought home a big, loud, food-motivated ball-of-energy, with\
      \ a tendency to bolt. Eventually we figured things out, but not before she destroyed\
      \ a lot of shoes & underwear, ate a bag of Hershey's kisses, and got hit by\
      \ a car (just scrapes, amazingly).\r\n\r\nFor a long time we tried to keep her\
      \ off the furniture, but finally conceded a large armchair, the futon, and\u2014\
      on special occasions\u2014our bed and the couch. Petra maintained a preference\
      \ for human laps (particularly guests) until she was about 10 or 11 years old,\
      \ when her hips didn't seem up for the task. She doesn't jump on the bed anymore,\
      \ but she still climbs up on \"her\" futon for naps and to sleep at night.\r\
      \n\r\nShe doesn't chase small animals anymore, but her hit list includes 6 opossums,\
      \ 1 squirrel, 1 rat, and 1 skunk. She treed a raccoon once, and didn't seem\
      \ to appreciate why we wouldn't let her wait for it to come back down.\r\n\r\
      \nFor a dog from Oregon, Petra hates the rain, and water in general. She was\
      \ super game to move with us to Davis, CA, where she could enjoy lots of 90+\
      \ degree weather, and a backyard that had lots of trees and squirrels. She's\
      \ also enjoyed our move to Oakland, where her futon is next to a window with\
      \ an aerial view of the street.\r\n\r\nShe was never a howler, but all of a\
      \ sudden, at about 8 years old, she started to sometimes howl along to sirens.\
      \ The first time she did it, we were totally shocked, and anytime there's a\
      \ loud siren now, we watch her hopefully. One morning, a couple years ago, she\
      \ surprised us by \"singing\" along to a Neko Case song. I managed to get a\

      \ and I can thank Petra for connecting me to one of my favorite musicians.\r\
      \n\r\nPetra is 13 now. She still smiles, especially if she can relax in a sunbeam.\
      \ She moves a lot slower than she used to, but still makes her way around the\
      \ house to be near us, and still prefers a futon for sleeping. She still loves\

      \n\r\nI love her so much, and I'm going to miss her like crazy when she's gone.\r\

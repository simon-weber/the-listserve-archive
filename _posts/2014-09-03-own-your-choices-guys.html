      <p>As I reflect now, a few months from entering a new decade - my 30''s, I realize
      that I''ve made a lot of poor choices in the past. I''ve chosen to disregard
      certain friends'' feelings when making reckless decisions. I''ve chosen to do
      stupid, unsafe things even when completely unnecessary. For those choices that
      hurt others, I am deeply and sincerely sorry. (Do you also find it harder to
      forgive yourself for your mistakes than to laud yourself for your successes?)
      I''ve also made some good choices. I''ve worked my ass off to go to school and
      law school and pass the bar exam (twice!) and cultivate some relationships and
      try hard to be a good daughter/sister/wife/mother/friend. Some of my choices,
      I feel guilty about. I''m a fairly new mom, who chose to work from home. I could
      have focused more on growing my law practice helping those in need of good afforable
      legal help, or worked more hours at the startups that me, my husband and one
      of our friends founded (RentalRoost, Houserie, and GrayRoost - check it out!).
      But instead, I chose to channel my energy on this tiny human being that I created

      I feel incredibly guilty. Like I''m a bad feminist. Like Sheryl Sandberg is
      tsk-tsk-ing me right now for not leaning in. But at the end of the day, doesn''t

      <p>I want to shout out to my little brother Harish who is one of the bravest

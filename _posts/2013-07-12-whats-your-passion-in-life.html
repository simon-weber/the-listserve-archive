    body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nI wanna tell you about a few things that I\xB4m passionate about.\
      \ In my opinion I think it\xB4s important for your own well being to have something\
      \ to be passionate about. One of my biggest passion is is ballet (and all kind\
      \ of dancing). I love to go to a good performance or show. The things I love\
      \ are a bit weird. I loved the excitement in the audience, I love to see the\
      \ dancers sweat (my sister have never understand that!) and see how they muscles\
      \ doing all the work while they try to show the audience with there faces that\
      \ this is peace of cake (which it isn\xB4t at all!). I also love the costumes-\
      \ especially the tutus in a ballet performance. I love to see a dancer do point\
      \ work in their point shoes, and I know a lot of the French name of the movements,\
      \ even though it\xB4s several years since I danced myself. Ballet is so graceful\
      \ and elegant and so hard to do! One of my favorite buildings in Norway (where\
      \ I\xB4m from) is the opera house. Whenever I get the change I will go to a\
      \ ballet show with the Norwegian National Ballet and one of my favorite moments\
      \ is right before the curtain will rise and revile the ballet dancers. Another\
      \ favorite moment is when you enter the performance area and the orchestra are\
      \ warming up. A lot of people think that is a mess of different sounds, but\
      \ I love it! If you happens to be in Norway I strongly recommend a ballet performance\
      \ of the Norwegian ballet company. Right now Ingrid Lorentzen is the ballet\
      \ director and head of the ballet company and she is a perfectionist so I guess\
      \ all the show is brilliant now! At least the nutcracker was!\r\n\r\nMusical\
      \ is another passion of mine. I wanted so badly to become a musical artist,\
      \ but Norway is a small country so few can survive as performance artist, so\
      \ I\xB4m ending up in early childhood care instead. What I love about musicals\
      \ are all the singing and dancing at once. It has always fascinated me, since\
      \ I at age 7 watched the whole movie \"The sound of music\" on the television.\
      \ I wished it would be social accepted to burst out in song and dance whenever,\
      \ and sometimes I do that. I use that a lot with the children in the cr\xE8\
      che or kindergarten and the absolutely love it when I sings the message instead\
      \ of telling them. A very effective way of giving message cause everyone of\
      \ them listen!\r\n\r\nPhotography is another thing I love to do. Unfortunate\
      \ I don\xB4t have much time to take photos anymore since I just finished a hectic\
      \ study, but I will someday take photos again. And I don\xB4t have access to\
      \ a studio anymore. I loved to be in a studio and work with people. So much\
      \ fun! I love to take landscape photography and portraits. In my photos I try\
      \ to show how I get the feeling a person is. It\xB4s kind of hard to explain,\
      \ but I wanna show the good sides and what people is passionate about.\r\n\r\
      \nAnother passion of mine (and I promise this is the last one) is to travel.\
      \ I love to experience new cultures, new ways to live and not to forget talk\
      \ English! It\xB4s a fascinating language.\r\n\r\nLast I will like thanks to\
      \ Christina for introducing me to The Listserve.\r\n\r\nHope you all have a\
      \ nice day!\r\n\r\n\r\nJanne Cecilie B\t\r\njannececilielistserve@gmail.com\t\

      <p>Three things I ask:<br />1) Treat others as you want to be treated.  Everyone
      has a backstory which isn''t fully known.  Before dismissing others, put yourself
      in their shoes and look through their eyes.  Or better yet, give them a smile
      and a kind word or even engage with them.  We are all 99+% the same.  Why don''t

      haven&#8217;t already done so, engage in the arts.  Take up painting or sculpting.
      Become involved with theatre, or my personal favorite, music.  I have been involved

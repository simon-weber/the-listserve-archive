      \ The third person has to say a word associated to the second, and so for. The\
      \ rules basically state that you cannot repeat a word already said, and you\
      \ cannot hesitate more than a few seconds. So, of example, I could start with\
      \ \u201Ccloud\u201D, then could come \u201Crain\u201D, \u201Cwater\u201D, \u201C\

      \ What you\u2019ll have to do is create a tumblr post, complete with Title and\

      The general idea is that you sign up to a list. Then someone buys a empty sketchbook,

      <p>I imagine most of you have played the game Word Association. It involves

      you cannot repeat a word already said, and you cannot hesitate more than a few
      seconds. So, of example, I could start with &#8220;cloud&#8221;, then could
      come &#8220;rain&#8221;, &#8220;water&#8221;, &#8220;cold&#8221;, &#8220;hot&#8221;,
      etc. You get the picture.<br />Now, how&#8217;s this gonna work you ask me.

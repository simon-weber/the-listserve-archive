      \ 2 of them, both girls.  One of them is named Sydney (age 10) & the other is\
      \ Annabella (age 7).  They are both insane... of course, it takes one to know\
      \ one.\r\n\r\nOnce I watched a PBS show on how they made cheese.  To my naive\
      \ eyes, it appeared like they were putting water into a large vat & stirring\
      \ it continuously.  Later that evening, while I was taking a bath, I thought\
      \ it would be a fantastic idea to try to make cheese by swirling the water around\
      \ in the bathtub.  I pretty much succeeded in making a large mess, but no cheese,\
      \ which was disappointing.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a teenager, my mom would tell me\
      \ to do certain things around the house before she got home like emptying the\
      \ dishwasher or dusting the living room.  Occasionally I would be asked to vacuum\
      \ the main level of the house.  The carpet is pretty thick.  I figured out that\
      \ if you ran the vacuum over the floor (not plugged in), it would show the same\
      \ pattern on the carpet that it would if you really vacuumed.  So I would get\
      \ lazy &  just move the vacuum around the room before she got home.  It wasn\u2019\
      t until later in life that I realized it took the same amount of energy to do\
      \ it the \u201Clazy\u201D way or the right way.\r\n\r\nNow a word from my crazy\
      \ kids:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSydney - \"Kevin doesn't like thunder storms.\"\r\n\r\
      \nAnnabella - \"Riley doesn't like tomatoes.\"\r\n\r\nSydney - \"What does that\
      \ have to do with what we were talking about? Tomatoes do not fall from the\
      \ sky nor are they thunder or lightning.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMe - \"If I have it,\
      \ I don\u2019t share it. If I share it, I don\u2019t have it. What is it?\"\r\
      \n\r\nSydney - \"Ebola.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ooooo.... I got a butt whisper.\
      \ Never mind, it escaped.\" - Sydney\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSydney - \"It says in this\

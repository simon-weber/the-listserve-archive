      \ My grandmother was the light that transformed Sam\u2019s depressive darkness\

      \ stage performance, was my grandmother. She was Sam\u2019s foundation, Sam\u2019\
      s home base, Sam\u2019s safety net which allowed him to dream so fearlessly.\r\
      \n\r\nSam\u2019s School, the book written to memorialize my grandfather\u2019\
      s life and his connection to Student U, begins in a hospital room as Sam conducts\

      \u201D on my kazoo as my family sings along.  Sam\u2019s School then travels\
      \ backwards in time, tracing my grandfather\u2019s life from his birth to this\
      \ grand finale. However, Sam\u2019s death is not where any story ends. It is\
      \ not where his story, Student U\u2019s story, or my story ends, and least of\
      \ all, it is not where my grandmother\u2019s story ends.\r\n\r\nThis was the\
      \ unwritten scene right after Sam\u2019s final song:\r\n\r\nShe sits in the\
      \ waiting room but no longer has anything to wait for.  Three minutes earlier\
      \ her husband of sixty years heart rate slowed to zero.  One day earlier she\
      \ had said her final goodbye, brushing her left hand over his right.  Three\
      \ days earlier she was told there was no hope and asked the doctor to please\
      \ let him go in peace.  Three weeks earlier she had been told lymphoma.  And\
      \ now she is in the waiting room waiting for nothing.\r\n\r\nShe looks straight\
      \ ahead at a new chapter in her life\u2019s story.  Over the previous sixty\
      \ years she has played sidekick to the protagonist.  Now she will take center\
      \ stage.  Their journey will become her path.  Their duet will become her solo.\
      \  Her song will sound different than their song.  He used to kazoo as she sang\
      \ along.  Now her voice will alone need to carry the tune.  But rather than\
      \ allow their last performance to be her crescendo, she is determined for an\
      \ encore worthy of a standing ovation.\r\n\r\nShe sits in the waiting room ready\
      \ for everything.  Her fingers rub the wedding ring which 60 years ago was too\
      \ tight and now is a permanent fixture on her hand.  She holds his hand in her\
      \ heart, breaths in deeply, breaths out slowly, and begins the rest of her life.\r\
      \n\r\nThe rest of her life lasts four and a half years, a full four and a half\
      \ years longer than any of us expected. During those years, my grandma was able\
      \ to celebrate mine and Amanda\u2019s wedding and sing to my daughter, her great\
      \ grandchild.\r\n\r\nWhen my daughter Eliana turned one month old, my grandma\

      in time, tracing my grandfather&#8217;s life from his birth to this grand finale.
      However, Sam&#8217;s death is not where any story ends. It is not where his
      story, Student U&#8217;s story, or my story ends, and least of all, it is not
      where my grandmother&#8217;s story ends.</p>

      <p>This was the unwritten scene right after Sam&#8217;s final song:</p>

      <p>She sits in the waiting room but no longer has anything to wait for.  Three
      minutes earlier her husband of sixty years heart rate slowed to zero.  One day

      is in the waiting room waiting for nothing.</p>

      <p>She looks straight ahead at a new chapter in her life&#8217;s story.  Over
      the previous sixty years she has played sidekick to the protagonist.  Now she
      will take center stage.  Their journey will become her path.  Their duet will

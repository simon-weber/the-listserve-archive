      <p>Here are two of them:</p>

      <p>At a recent synagogue event in Fayetteville, GA, I asked a woman in her seventies
      what advice she&#8217;d give to a young woman just starting off her life and
      career. Her advice to me was based on the premise that we live in a man&#8217;s

      her out after she kissed him. She looked around the room and picked up a crowbar,
      telling him that he&#8217;d let her out now. He did. She didn&#8217;t tell anyone.
      For an hour after that, she and I talked about how much has changed for women
      in the workplace since then, and sadly, how much progress still needs to be
      made. Both of us were so inspired by the other. She was a badass.</p>

      <p>I was staying with a Rabbi in McAllen, TX and I got food poisoning. I spent
      six hours in the middle of the night hunched over a toilet bowl, and he and
      his wife were nothing but gracious and understanding. A different community
      member took me to the Emergency Room. As IV fluids were pumped into my veins,
      we chatted like old friends, even though we had only met the night before. Her

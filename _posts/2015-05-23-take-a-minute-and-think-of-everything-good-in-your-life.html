      <p>Do me a favor. Take a minute and think of everything good in your life. You
      are blessed beyond measure when you count the simple things.</p>

      <p>1. (A little about me)<br />I was born and raised in Northwest Indiana. I

      for the better and impact a multitude of lives.</p>

      <p>2. (Something that I&#8217;m passionate about)<br />I have a deep fascination
      and love for solar technology. I hope to one day create a thermostat-like device
      that measures the solar footprint of a house/building and allocates energy from

      No. Do I dream about a world existing without the dependence of fossil fuels?

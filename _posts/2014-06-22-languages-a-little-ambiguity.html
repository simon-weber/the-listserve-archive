      I\u2019m a 22 year old girl born and raised in New Delhi (it\u2019s almost 46\xB0\

      \ people who always knew what they wanted to do in life. So my University major\
      \ was Japanese - and even though I was just fascinated by things like origami\
      \ back in high school that led me to this, Japanese made me fall in love with\
      \ languages. So I tried learning French and gave up mid way only to realise\
      \ that my fascination was more towards languages that don\u2019t use the Roman\
      \ script. Next I took up Korean and man, don\u2019t I love it! I want to learn\
      \ Arabic next but then Esperanto looks interesting as well (any Esperanto speakers\
      \ here? Would love to hear from you!). Being a polyglot is an amazing thing.\
      \ I speak 4 languages right now - my mother tongue Hindi, apart from English,\
      \ Japanese and Korean, and I\u2019m still not satisfied with just these. However,\
      \ it\u2019s just a little sick how people look at languages in India. It\u2019\
      s a country still obsessed with orthodox careers like engineering, medical sciences,\
      \ law etc. and people end up thinking that you didn\u2019t get anywhere else\
      \ to end up with a language as your major. What they don\u2019t know is just\
      \ because of this stereotype, the field remains untapped to a great extent and\
      \ you can do so much more than the traditional careers if you\u2019re good at\
      \ it.\r\n\r\nSo why did I say that my professional life is a big question mark?\
      \ Well, because I don't know where will I be a few months down the line and\
      \ I hate this ambiguity. While I have some real amazing job offers waiting for\
      \ me here, I am waiting for a small little email from the MEXT of Japan that\
      \ gives me my scholarship result. I got admitted to Waseda University in Tokyo\
      \ for a masters in International Relations but I still don\u2019t know if I\u2019\
      ll go or not due to this scholarship result. I\u2019ll probably have the result\
      \ with me by the time this email is sent out on the Listserve though! And yes,\

      \ I\u2019m doing what I love to do, have an amazing family and I\u2019m in love\

      \ before, but I guess you only feel the right kind of love once in life. Of\
      \ all things, it happened when I wasn\u2019t even expecting it. How good could\

<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>Its pretty cool that I have won the lottery.  Oh what to say and what not to say!</p>
<p>A little introduction:</p>
<p>I am a recent Graduate Mechanical Engineer from University of California,San Diego. Though originally from India I have been in the US for the past two years and hopefully stay here much longer. </p>
<p>Read. Read books, magazines, articles, anything and everything. But also do, do something , anything and everything. Keep investing in yourself and keep learning. </p>
<p>Live as if you will die tomorrow. Learn as if you will live forever - Mahatma Gandhi</p>

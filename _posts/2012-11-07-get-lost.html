<p>Explorers are we, intrepid and bold, Out in the wild, amongst wonders untold.  Equipped with our wits, a map, and a snack, We&#8217;re searching for fun, we&#8217;re on the right track!<br />- Introduction, The Essential Calvin and Hobbes</p>
<p>Calvin &amp; Hobbes epitomizes the childhood I had wanted but as a kid, did not possess the guts to live. As an adult (or someone pretending to be), I'm trying not to live a life of regret by going by the words of yet another person with an impressive imagination -- Tolkien, who said "All those who wander are not lost".</p>
<p>New Yorkers pride themselves in knowing exactly where they're going. And for the most part, I do too. But getting lost sometimes just means we don't know what we're supposed to be looking for. And that's totally okay.</p>
<p>Getting lost is not a waste of time. Sure it can be frustrating when you least intend to be. But when the clock isn't ticking, I've often found myself discovering beautiful vistas, incredible stories, quirky alleys, and accidentally poignant photographs.</p>
<p>So go on - Wander. Explore. Get Lost. And don't be afraid to like it.</p>

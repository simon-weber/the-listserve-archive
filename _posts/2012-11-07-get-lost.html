      <p>Calvin &amp; Hobbes epitomizes the childhood I had wanted but as a kid, did
      not possess the guts to live. As an adult (or someone pretending to be), I''m
      trying not to live a life of regret by going by the words of yet another person
      with an impressive imagination -- Tolkien, who said "All those who wander are
      not lost".</p>

      <p>New Yorkers pride themselves in knowing exactly where they''re going. And
      for the most part, I do too. But getting lost sometimes just means we don''t
      know what we''re supposed to be looking for. And that''s totally okay.</p>

      <p>Getting lost is not a waste of time. Sure it can be frustrating when you
      least intend to be. But when the clock isn''t ticking, I''ve often found myself
      discovering beautiful vistas, incredible stories, quirky alleys, and accidentally
      poignant photographs.</p>

      <p>So go on - Wander. Explore. Get Lost. And don''t be afraid to like it.</p>

      If you ever have the opportunity to, consider fostering for a shelter. Animal\

      \ any TNR programs nearby. Trap Neuter Return programs work to catch feral cats\
      \ with humane traps, neuter them, and then return them to their community. This\
      \ is the best option for feral cats because if they end up in shelters, they\
      \ will be put down. The best course of action is to allow the cats to live where\
      \ they live, but to prevent them from expanding their populations.\r\n\r\nThank\

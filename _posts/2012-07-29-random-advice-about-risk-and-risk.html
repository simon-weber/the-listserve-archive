<p>We&#8217;re taught to fear &#8220;the stranger&#8221;, but most sexual assaults are done by someone the victim knows. Most children will be assaulted by a relative or family friend, most women by an acquaintance. Teach your children to know a dangerous situation, rather than relying on &#8220;stranger danger&#8221;. Women should know that they are not necessarily safe when they are with people they know.</p>
<p>Conversely, enjoy the company of people around you. Do not approach everyone like they are a potential scam artist/thief/rapist/liar. Life is too short to view everyone as a suspect.</p>
<p>If someone has a weapon and says &#8220;Come with me or I&#8217;ll hurt you&#8221;, DO NOT GO! Where you are is much safer than whatever abandoned place you are about to be brought to, that&#8217;s why they want you to leave it. Throw a loud fit and run towards people as if your life depended on it (it might). Even if you are injured, you are in a populated place and will receive medical attention. Many people have been murdered and/or sexually assaulted by simply following instructions.</p>
<p>Love is a risk, but worth it. After exiting a marriage with someone who was such a compulsive liar that he was effectively a stranger, I thought I&#8217;d never take that risk again. However, after time (and therapy), I am lucky enough to find myself less than a month away from marrying the best partner I could possibly imagine.</p>
<p>If you live in a country that celebrates Halloween, let your children celebrate it as you did when you were young: scared and in the dark. &#8220;Safe&#8221; events aren&#8217;t the point of Halloween, and it isn&#8217;t fun for kids.</p>
<p>With much luck, health, and happiness,</p>

    Timing is everything. My internet service will end tomorrow as I prepare to leave
    the country for an extended period. For a long while I have thought about what
    it would be like to live with "one robe, one bowl" but it seemed so hard to let
    go of all my carefully chosen earthly goods. The Universe and the airlines have
    conspired to make my thoughts a reality. One suitcase. 50 pounds. And a lot of
    soul searching.  More than 60 years of collecting has turned into 3 months of
    giving away and donating everything that will not fit into the suitcase. I believe
    I have been given an opportunity to live my dream, and with that, a chance to
    get clear about what is really important in this all too brief life. With that
    in mind: it is our relationships, not our "stuff" that is truly important. The
    ones you love will live forever in your mind and heart. Life is short, but we
    can cause our experience of it to be deep and wide. There is no distance too great
    for thoughts to travel. Dreams come true. Be ready.</p>

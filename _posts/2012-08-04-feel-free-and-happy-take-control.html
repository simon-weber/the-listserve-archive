    <p>Many of my friends and family have warned me, telling me it was very risky
    to be an entrepreneur, because I could fail, lose a lot of time and money. Telling
    me that it was much better to remain an employee, to be protected by the salary
    and social protection.</p>

    <p>Finally, I did not listen and I created my own business  In the mean time,
    I realized that many people around me were dismissed because of the crisis while
    I still have my job, my company and I managed to keep my team. So being an employee
    could be risky as well, especially for aged people.</p>

    <p>It''s not easy but I am convinced that somehow I''ll be able to do great things.  Above
    all, I am no longer dependent on others, I no longer need to find a company that
    suits me, nor a position where I am happy. I no longer need to communicate the
    relevance of my ideas, I just follow my intuition, think and act.</p>

    <p>The future only depends on me, the energy that I put in what I do, my choices,
    the opportunities that I take, the mistakes I make and finally my ability to turn
    the luck into success.   Now I feel free, happy and master of my fate. And I think
    it will last forever</p>

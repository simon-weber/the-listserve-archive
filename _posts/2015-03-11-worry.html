      <p>I lost my father this past September. I lost my only sibling, my brother,
      in November 2010. He was only 46. My dad, 69. I just turned 46 and I&#8217;m
      mildly freaked out that I will die this year - just because, yanno, my brother
      went at this age. It&#8217;s one of those irrational thoughts that occasionally
      crosses my mind and decides to sit there for a while to see how I will react.
      It would be one thing if I lived my brothers life style, but I don&#8217;t and
      if there is anything my father taught me, it was to take care of my body and
      pay attention to the signs it gives me. He did not. He suffered. A lot. It was
      painful to watch, but how could I not? At least I could be there for him when
      he needed me. And he did need me - and that felt good. When he died, I was by
      his side, holding his hand. He went peacefully. My brother left with no warning
      and, maybe because he was the first closest to me to die, I miss him terribly.</p>

      <p>I used to suffer and worry over things like this, constantly. I used to be
      the doormat in relationships. I used to second guess myself and where my outward
      appearance showed confidence, I was a complete mess inside. I always considered
      myself a victim. That someone or something did me wrong when all I was trying
      to do was do the right thing, be loved by someone, love as much as I could,
      help everyone and just be someone to someone. What was wrong with that? It seemed
      no one understood me. So I suffered. Constantly. My biggest question to myself,
      that I always asked myself when I was crying because I was so misunderstood
      was &#8216;Why?&#8217;. Why me? Why now? Why this? Why that?</p>

      <p>Really, who cares why? There is a meme on the internet:<br />Do you have
      a problem? Yes. Can you do something about it? Yes. Then why worry?<br />Do
      you have a problem? Yes. Can you do something about it? No. Then why worry?<br

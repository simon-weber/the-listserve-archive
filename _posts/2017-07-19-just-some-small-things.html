      <p>I went through an awful, awful breakup in 2015. I was dumped and I felt abandoned.
      I was beyond depressed, couldn''t eat for over a month, had trouble sleeping,
      felt terrified that I would never get over this person, that I might never /want/
      to. But less than two years later, I''ve got a wonderful new partner, I''m confident
      in my ability to survive on my own, and I''m more fulfilled than I''ve ever
      been. I searched constantly for messages that it would get better while I was
      in my darkest times, and some of those lights in the darkness came from the
      Listserve. So just know that if I can do it, you sure as hell can. I thought
      everything was over. But all emotions fade, and we will always return back to
      a steady center - equilibrium is the rule of life.</p>

      <p>I''m only 22, but I already feel kind of jaded about the world. I don''t
      know if this is just a thing with my generation, or if it''s inevitable with
      passing into adulthood, but I would love some advice on dealing with the transition
      into adulthood and staring down the face of endless cycles of debt and what
      feels like the slavery of working life.</p>

      <p>I''m nonbinary! This basically means that I don''t feel like I fit in either
      social category of "man" or "woman." I also prefer to be referred to with the
      singular "they/them" pronouns, rather than either she/her or he/him. My identity
      has been met with a LOT of confusion, and even when people mean well, anger
      and derision. My advice to you if you meet or know someone who says they are
      nonbinary is NOT to fight with them about the validity of their identity. They''ve
      already decided this is who they are, so your arguments will get you nowhere.

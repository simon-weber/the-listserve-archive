      \ So, instead, I want to recommend you a method that can help you grow (whether\

      \ for me on Saturday evenings, because they know I use these evenings to process\
      \ and exam my conscience and then review and evaluate it.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner\
      \ I open my agenda and remember all the things I had to do during the week.\r\
      \n\r\nI ask myself: \u2018What are the mistakes I made during the week?\u2019\
      \r\n\r\n\u2018What did I do that was correct? What are the things I could\u2019\

      \ from time to time.\r\n\r\nThis method of self-analysis, self-education, year\

      <p>So I''ll start introducing myself. Hi! My name is Thais, I''m 18 years old
      and I live in one of the biggest cities in the world, Sao Paulo - Brazil. I''ve
      just been back from an exchange program; I spent a whole year in Australia thanks
      to an organization called Rotary International.</p>

      <p>And that is what I was going to talk about: Travel and why you should travel
      (more). But I must confess that I was starting to get bored myself. So, instead,
      I want to recommend you a method that can help you grow (whether professionally,
      socially or personally).  Now that I&#8217;m 18, I&#8217;m becoming responsible
      for more and more things, so I must apply more discipline into my life.</p>

      <p>This method was suggested by an important bank president from Wall Street,
      New York.  He said:<br />&#8220;I keep an agenda where I write down all the
      appointments that I have that day. My family never makes any plans for me on
      Saturday evenings, because they know I use these evenings to process and exam
      my conscience and then review and evaluate it.</p>

      <p>After dinner I open my agenda and remember all the things I had to do during
      the week.</p>

      <p>I ask myself: &#8216;What are the mistakes I made during the week?&#8217;</p>

      <p>&#8216;What did I do that was correct? What are the things I could&#8217;ve
      done better?&#8217;</p>

      <p>&#8216;What can I learn from this experience?&#8217;</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve felt unhappy many times when processing my agenda. It surprises

      <p>I can&#8217;t recommend it but with much enthusiasm &#8220;</p>

      <p>Yes, you should travel as many times as possible like I was going to write

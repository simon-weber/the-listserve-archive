      <p>1.<br />Let&#8217;s start with three quotes to set the mood:</p>

      <p>You are a mashup of what you let into your life.<br />(Austin Kleon)</p>

      <p>I am always doing that which I cannot do,<br />in order that I may learn
      how to do it. (Pablo Picasso)</p>

      <p>If you always do what you''ve always done,<br />you''ll always get what you''ve
      always got.<br />(Attributed to lots of different people&#8230; but, really,
      who cares about the author...)</p>

      <p>2.<br />I&#8217;ll share these thoughts:</p>

      <p>&#8212; My goal here is to discuss the subject &#8220;Jack of all trades
      vs. Master of one&#8221; attitude (yes: one, not "none") and have your feedback
      &#8212; check wikipedia for &#8220;Jack of all trades&#8221;.<br />&#8212; My
      curiosity leads me to explore and practice lots of different things (and that
      is good!).<br />&#8212; The same curiosity makes me to swap between things a
      lot and that *might* be bad (for sure it gives me a sense of guilt).<br />&#8212;
      I think that &#8220;society&#8221; in general favors the image of expert people
      (they *are* romantic!) over generalists.<br />&#8212; Things are not black or
      white, the world is complex.</p>

      <p>3.<br />Questions for you guys:</p>

      <p>A. Where do you place yourself? Generalist or expert? A mix of the two?<br
      />B. How do you balance between horizontal (multi-skill) and vertical (one)
      learning/practicing?<br />C. How do you select your sources? (people/events/books/websites/tv/etc.)
      How do you edit what you expose yourself to?<br />D. Share your best sources.
      What inspires you?<br />E. Do you have principles/rules/routines that help you
      through your day/life? Do you actually follow them?</p>

      <p>4.<br />Bonus tracks:</p>

      <p>Check the handbook for new employees at Valve (google it! - no links allowed

      might be &#8220;THE ANSWER&#8221; to this mail.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Non-reading is not just the absence of reading. It is a genuine activity,

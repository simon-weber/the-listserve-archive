    \ conversation, with its one-worded banter laced in falsity, could be tolerated.\_\
    \ But the silence between them was painful.\_ She wondered what had happened to\

    \ insecurities to ideologies.\_ Their close friendship had helped make the transition\
    \ from small towns to college life easier for the both of them.\_ Although they\
    \ had differing personalities, they seemed to complement each other.\_ But, most\
    \ importantly, they had trusted each other.\_ Recently, all of that had disappeared\
    \ without warning.\r\n\r\n\_\_\_\_\_\_When it was time to leave, she didn\u2019\
    t say that she was heading to class.\_ She didn\u2019t want to interrupt the silence,\
    \ an invisible yet unforgivable barrier that had formed between them.\_ She didn\u2019\
    t owe an explanation for her departure, and she knew she wouldn\u2019t have received\
    \ a response anyway.\_ Besides, she was sick of trying.\_ She forced her work\
    \ into a tattered backpack, stuffing notebooks filled with messy, looping handwriting\
    \ and elaborate margin doodles in between a handful of novels and a laptop.\_\
    \ Hoisting the bag over her shoulder, she pulled a battered iPod out of her pocket,\
    \ inserted the small headphones into her ears, and pressed play.\_ She breathed\
    \ a sigh of relief.\_ Though it was temporary, her music allowed her to escape\
    \ from the silence that smothered her.\r\n\r\n\_\_\_\_\_\_Her class started at\
    \ 2 o\u2019clock, but her dorm was a good distance away from the English building,\
    \ so she left at exactly 1:30.\_ She decided to take a bus halfway and then walk\
    \ the remainder, allowing her to be one of the first to class but still giving\
    \ her the opportunity to enjoy the beautiful sunny day.\_ The afternoon temperature\
    \ was unusually warm, and the day seemed to belong in May instead of February.\_\
    \ This unexpected heat wave baffled the local weathermen, but it thrilled the\
    \ students.\_ As she stood at the bus stop, she noticed a few tan, bikini-clad\
    \ girls were lounging on beach towels outside of her dorm.\_ Several drivers stared\
    \ at them as they drove by.\_ The bus pulled up next to her, and she felt a familiar\
    \ rush of warm air graze her cheek.\_ She realized she was sweating.\_ She greeted\
    \ the bus driver, courteously taking her headphones out of her ears and making\
    \ eye-contact.\_ An old man with a beard smiled at her, and she smiled back and\
    \ sat next to him.\_ She fiddled with her iPod, which she had put on Shuffle mode,\
    \ listening to each song for about five seconds until she changed it, briefly\
    \ moving from soft jazz to classic rock to hip hop in a rhythmic pace.\_ Her musical\
    \ taste was eclectic, to say the least, much like her personality.\_ She refused\
    \ to associate with one particular stereotype.\_ Instead, she dabbled in each\
    \ one with no notions of stylistic identity, wearing what she liked and listening\
    \ to what she wanted.\_ Each song, no matter its genre, represented something\
    \ to her.\_ Sometimes it reminded her of an old friend or a past memory, while\
    \ other times the bass line just seemed to reflect her mood.\_ She let her emotions\
    \ choose the song, letting her thumb repeatedly press the \u201Cnext\u201D button\
    \ while she stared out the window.\_ Finally, she settled on a fast-paced, top-40\
    \ track that reminded her of high school, a track that she used to listen to with\
    \ her friends while they drove around town with the stereo turned up and the windows\
    \ rolled down.\_ It was a track of innocent love, something she had once experienced.\_\
    \ She had forgotten how it felt, but after the first few lines she could feel\
    \ her heart beating along to the familiar melody of the chords.\_ She thought\
    \ back to that time and briefly admired how much simpler life had been then.\r\
    \n\r\n\_\_\_\_\_\_The song abruptly changed to one with repetitious bass pounding\
    \ and loud, heavy guitar riffs.\_ She quickly forgot of her past, as the nostalgia\
    \ of blissful immaturity faded away, immediately replaced with the new track\u2019\
    s rapid lyrics. She silently tapped her foot to the pulsating beat.\r\n\r\n\_\_\
    \_\_\_\_The driver lurched to a stop just as a guitar screeched in her ears, and\
    \ she held on to the pole next to her to prevent herself from being thrown forward.\_\
    \ She grabbed her bag, squeezed out from the area that encased her tiny seat,\
    \ and carefully stepped off the bus onto the pavement and headed toward class.\_\
    \ She walked slowly, admiring the way the bright sun shone through the naked trees,\
    \ trees that weren\u2019t ready to bloom and probably wouldn\u2019t be ready for\
    \ a few months, if that.\_ The winter had been abnormally harsh that year, and\
    \ it was predicted that the trees would probably bloom later than normal as a\
    \ result.\_ The vivid, recent image of the trees covered in snow sprang into her\
    \ mind, and she realized a week ago, she had to wear a winter coat and gloves\
    \ while walking to class.\_ Now, it was forty degrees warmer and anyone wearing\
    \ a coat would be scalding.\r\n\r\n\_\_\_\_\_\_She briefly glanced at the people\
    \ she passed by.\_ Class had just gotten out, so the pathways were crowded.\_\
    \ Several groups of rowdy boys walked past, describing their drunken hook-ups\
    \ from the previous weekend and rambunctiously slapping each other on the back.\_\
    \ They were all dressed similarly, wearing khaki shorts and pastel-colored polo\
    \ shirts, their dark hair sticking out from underneath backward baseball caps.\_\
    \ They were tall and handsome, and they all seemed to have similar features.\_\
    \ Their collective good-looks repulsed her.\_ There was no variety; they were\
    \ all the same.\_ Next to them walked large packs of girls, most of them blond\
    \ and tan with thin, dainty physiques.\_ Some of them wore brightly colored sundresses.\_\
    \ Others wore tennis shoes and running shorts, though their neatly combed back\
    \ hair and flawlessly applied make-up gave no indication of exercise.\_ They were\
    \ all beautiful, but they blended together, no one face standing out amongst the\
    \ others.\_ In the beginning of the school year, she had envied their apparent\
    \ mass perfection.\_ She began dressing up to go to class and started wearing\
    \ makeup.\_ Though she rarely wore earrings, she began to stick pearls into her\
    \ ears every day, regardless of her outfit.\_ She even abandoned her tomboyish\
    \ wardrobe and occasionally wore dresses or skirts.\_ But, soon enough, she got\
    \ sick of it.\_ She grew sick of waking up early every morning to straighten her\
    \ hair, to put together a perfectly matching outfit.\_ She grew sick of pretending\
    \ to be someone she was not just to fit into a crowd of people that she did not\
    \ resemble in the slightest.\_ Instead, she forced herself apart from her classmates.\_\
    \ She gradually got used to the fraternity boys looking right through her, as\
    \ if she didn\u2019t exist, and to the girls in class talking to each other but\
    \ not to her.\_ She watched them converse as they walked past, but her music pounded\
    \ in her ears, preventing her from hearing them.\_ As she walked, she noticed\
    \ that she was the only one wearing jeans.\r\n\r\n\_\_\_\_\_\_She looked down\
    \ at her iPod as she approached the building, checking the time.\_ About ten minutes\
    \ early.\_ Not too bad.\_ She systematically entered the building, walked down\
    \ three flights of stairs, took a left, then a right, then a left again.\_ Before\
    \ entering, she turned off her music, wrapped up the headphones carefully, and\
    \ put the iPod into her pocket.\_ Then she entered, just like always.\_ The only\
    \ difference was that, this time, she was standing in a room of emptiness.\_ The\
    \ light was off, and the lack of windows made her feel as if she were standing\
    \ in a cave instead of a classroom.\_ It was completely silent, apart from the\
    \ humming of a computer that sat in the corner, its screensaver a series of random\
    \ twists and turns that filled the screen with color.\_ This computer was the\
    \ only source of light, and the screensaver\u2019s colors faintly shined across\
    \ the room onto the wall.\_ A technological rainbow.\_ She was mildly surprised\
    \ at the unexpected abyss she was standing in.\_ Even though she was ten minutes\
    \ early, she was never the first one to class.\_ She felt as if she were trespassing,\
    \ even though she was in the right place.\_ She watched as the computer went into\
    \ sleep mode, the screen blackening like the room around her.\r\n\r\n\_\_\_\_\_\
    \_She considered waiting outside in the hallway for someone else to arrive, but\
    \ she decided to turn on the light switch next to the door instead.\_ She went\
    \ and sat down in her usual seat.\_ The song she had just been listening to was\
    \ repeating itself inside of her head; she quietly hummed and tapped her foot\
    \ to the rhythm.\_ Out of boredom, she pulled out one of her worn notebooks, its\
    \ pages nearly filled up even though the semester had only started a month or\
    \ two ago, and finished a doodle she had drawn of a man that had popped into her\
    \ head but probably didn\u2019t actually exist.\_ She shaded his cheekbones with\
    \ a stubby pencil, drew then erased then redrew his thick eyebrows, and lightly\
    \ added eyelashes to his bright, wide eyes that seemed to be staring directly\
    \ at her.\_ His lips were turned slightly upward in a mischievous half grin, as\
    \ if he knew something about her that no one else did.\_ Once she was satisfied\
    \ with her finished sketch, she awoke from her artistic trance and realized that\
    \ she was still alone.\_ She turned on her iPod and glanced at the clock.\_ 3:02.\r\
    \n\r\n\_\_\_\_\_\_Confused and suddenly worried that she was in the wrong room,\
    \ she opened the door and looked at the room number.\_ It was then that she noticed\
    \ the blue post-it on the door.\_ \u201CNo class today.\_ Office hours will be\
    \ held as usual tomorrow.\_ Sorry for any inconvenience.\u201D\_ While most students\
    \ would probably celebrate this cancelation, she felt empty, as empty as the room\
    \ she was standing in.\_ Instead of the interaction she longed for, even if it\
    \ was forced, she was once again thrust into an abnormal solitude.\r\n\r\n\_\_\
    \_\_\_\_She walked down the hallway and joined the throng of people walking home.\_\
    \ Although she was submersed by the crowd, she still seemed to be set apart from\
    \ them somehow.\_ She turned on her iPod and inserted her headphones to escape\
    \ from the nothingness that surrounded her.\_ Here, she was the queen of her own\
    \ world, a world with only one citizen.\_ Her world made sense; it was one of\
    \ sound and song.\_ The bass drum of her heartbeat set the 4/4 rhythm and her\
    \ footsteps pounded along in harmonized reverberation.\_ This beat was steady\
    \ and calming, unlike the confusion that she felt as she glanced at the people\
    \ that passed her by. She watched the crowd around her as their lips moved, almost\
    \ synchronized, but no sound came out.\_ Concentrating intently on the rhythm\
    \ that surrounded her, she looked ahead at the trees in the distance.\_ The sun\
    \ brightened their bare, crooked limbs, and though it was still early in the year,\
    \ she saw what looked to be a single white blossom slowly emerging to greet the\
    \ unfamiliar sun.\_ Her smile bloomed.\r\n\r\n\r\nEmily\r\nVirginia\r\n\r\n"

      \ but I left my heart in Swaziland many years ago.\r\n\r\nThe years I lived\
      \ in Swazi were wondrous. While I was so young, it was an impressionable age\
      \ and I couldn't have asked for a better childhood home and environment. It\
      \ has been difficult for me to explain the impact this tiny Kingdom has had\
      \ on me, so I have been trying for 3 years now to put it into a story. It is\
      \ fictional story, but inspired by true people and a true setting. I have never\
      \ told a soul about this, but I figured it is much easier to share my first\
      \ written words with thousands of people I don't know and a few I do.\r\n\r\n\
      This is the introduction, and a very rough draft.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\
      \n\r\nOur home sat on a beautiful and spacious piece of land in the mountains\
      \ of Swaziland. I remember the feeling of the rough, patchy grass prickling\
      \ against my feet as I ran from one hilly end of our backyard all the way to\
      \ where the swings and jungle gym sat. It was a long stretch of ground to cover\
      \ for my little legs, but I loved being outdoors and exploring the wonders and\
      \ dangers that existed behind my house, and deep into the woods. Our backyard\
      \ stretched down a small hill where it met a scary yet enticing pond that was\
      \ haplessly surrounded by stinging nettle plants. My sisters and I had some\
      \ unfortunate run-ins with those plants as we attempted to fearlessly get past\
      \ the barricade they had grown over the years. This pond was a reminder of the\
      \ line we were never allowed to cross, both determined by nature and our parents.\
      \ Lining our property on the right side was a small swimming pool and a row\
      \ of beautiful banana trees. Oh, those banana trees. My mother had planted them\
      \ the day she and my father laid the first brick of our home. Behind the pond\
      \ was the most majestic backdrop of rough and rocky mountains that turned lush-green\
      \ as they cascaded to the bottom of the Earth. Scattered in small clumps in\
      \ the distance were small, flat-roofed houses that were all constructed out\
      \ of the same corrugated iron material indigenous to Swazi. They were similar\
      \ in structure and size, but different in small ways: one family had painted\
      \ the left side of their house a bright mint green color, while another had\
      \ a cherry red door. If I squinted really hard, I was able to see the mothers\
      \ hanging up their family\u2019s freshly-laundered clothes on the white lines\
      \ draping from one end of their house to another. I would smile and think of\
      \ Thandiwe.\r\n\r\nI remember helping her around the house with the laundry\
      \ or cleaning. It was our time. We had been together since I was a baby when\
      \ she would swaddle me in a blanket and cautiously throw me on her back while\
      \ doing the housework. Mama hated that I bothered Thandiwe and always told me\
      \ to go finish my homework or play outside. But I never did. I always insisted\
      \ on her bathing me every night, and while she lathered the slimey soap bar\
      \ all over my body and washed my hair, she would sing me our special Xhosa lullaby.\r\
      \n\r\nThe End...for now.\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nOnce again, feel\

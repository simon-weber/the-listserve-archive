      <p><br />I found a robot&#8217;s heart today. I didn&#8217;t think they still
      made robots<br />with hearts, but there it was, at the corner of Leary and Sycamore.
      It<br />even looked like a heart: size of a fist, valves pulsing with pale<br
      />ching ching noises each time they opened and shut. The metal was old<br />and
      worn.</p>

      <p>I took it home and plugged it into my computer. It had a few jumbled<br />videos&#8212;the
      way older robots used to store memories.</p>

      <p>I sorted by number and began to watch.</p>

      <p>The first video was in a warehouse. Lines of identical, still robots,<br
      />presumably the same old-fashioned model as the one whose heart I&#8217;d<br

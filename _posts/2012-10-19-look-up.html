  body: "Look up my friend, look up to that night sky above you. Those stars you see,\
    \ impossibly far from where you stand, are the same ones I see. Those stars, some\
    \ have witnessed the birth of humanity, others burned out a millennium ago and\
    \ all we see is an echo. Impossibly far away, yet  impossibly close, I hope the\
    \ vastness of the universe makes your troubles melt away and brings you back to\
    \ another time, I know it brings me back.  I see these stars over me, and I am\
    \ comforted by that fact that the same stars shine over your head. One day, that\
    \ may be the last connection we old friends have. It is a promise, a promise that\
    \ as the years pass, we will never be completely alone. That we will always have\
    \ this, a faded photo, a scribbled note, a memory of days gone by. A promise that\
    \ us two weary travelers one day will meet again, and watch the stars together\
    \ again, separated by neither mountain nor sea.\r\n\r\nThis is something that's\
    \ been evolving for a year now. I wrote the second half last year for my girlfriend,\
    \  this piece of writing will forever be hers. I wrote the first half after we\
    \ broke up, then tonight I finished it off. Its one of my favorite things Ive\
    \ ever written, short and sweet, it brings me right back to one cold night last\
    \ year looking up at the stars with her.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrendan Illis\r\nbrendan.illis@illisimages.com\t\

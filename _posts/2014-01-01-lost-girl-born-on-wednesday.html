    body: "A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited\

      \ This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires\

      \ magnificent collaboration. Much to share and much to learn. Really craving\
      \ to find the way and the place to serve best, to sing and dance, share stories\
      \ and strength and laughter and connect along this journey. I believe I can\

    body: '<p>Hello fellow listservers,</p>

      <p>It has been 1601 days since I signed up to the listserve back in October
      2013. Since then I have started multiple topics I thought I should write about,
      but it still caught me by surprise. I&#8217;ve had a loss in my family last
      week and now I am back home in The Netherlands to spend some time with them.
      In a normal week you would find me in London, UK.</p>

      <p>As a world that is getting more divided, we need to be kind to each other.
      The UK needs to be kind to leavers and remainers. For and against Trump-ers,
      North and South Koreans, the Turkish and the Kurds, the UK and the EU. Be kind.
      Always remember; treat the other as you want them to treat you.</p>

      <p>Also for yourself, dream big. Go for the thing you are passionate about.
      Be an astronaut (&#8220;Nothing beats an astronaut&#8221; ad was so right).
      Be anything you want to be. Do what makes you tick, whether that is designing
      for Dementia (that sounds amazing, Alice), being an Electrial Engineer (Yes,
      Matt!) or sketching dreams and putting them on Instagram (that&#8217;s you,
      Lara!).</p>

      <p>Currently myself I am rebooting my drive to become an automotive designer.
      I&#8217;ve been passionate about it since I was a little boy and now I am a
      (digital) product designer looking to move into this space. Familiar with this
      field? Please reach out!</p>

      <p>Also, for some nice pictures and little stories about small cars, search
      little moving things on instagram (littlemovingthings)</p>

      <p>Last but not least; try out running. It&#8217;s near free, you&#8217;ll be
      outside and overall it is awesome. Try a &#8220;Couch to 5k&#8221; app. Also
      have good clothing, never be cold while running. For me, the best is running
      on a track with friends. No matter what running level you are at, at the end

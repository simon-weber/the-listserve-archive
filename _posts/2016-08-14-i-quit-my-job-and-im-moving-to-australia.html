      issues I care about, questions I have for the world. But today, I received the\
      \ proverbial email while driving with my family three hours (thank you, small-town\
      \ MO) to the St. Louis airport, where I boarded the plane I\u2019m now sitting\
      \ in. I drank in my last glimpses of the city that has been my home for the\
      \ past 6 years, and the state that I have lived in my whole life, but won\u2019\
      t see again for a year.\r\n\r\nWith that kind of timing, it seems the world\
      \ has already decided my topic for me.\r\n\r\nFor the past two years I\u2019\
      ve worked at a St. Louis rape crisis center, working with survivors of sexual\
      \ assault and sex trafficking. It\u2018s been an incredible opportunity; I grew\
      \ as an advocate, employee, coworker, friend, social justice warrior, and human.\
      \ One listserve topic I\u2019d considered was the impact trauma can have over\
      \ a lifetime. Fortunate that I\u2019ve never dealt with suicidal thoughts myself,\
      \ it wasn\u2019t until this job that I came to truly understand why someone\
      \ would view suicide as her only way to end the unbearable pain.\r\n\r\nI\u2019\
      m so grateful for that job, but I was burning out fast, from constantly witnessing\
      \ the ugliness of the world (reactively, never in a position to stop it. Just\
      \ try to make it hurt less), and from draining office dynamics. If anyone knows\
      \ how to solve issues of high turnover rates in nonprofits due to burnout, please\
      \ let me know (seriously, if I could become aneffective, helpful consultant,\
      \ I might just dedicate my life to that).\r\n\r\nThen I visited Australia and\
      \ New Zealand last summer with two friends from a semester in Holland, and I\
      \ fell in love with Sydney in a way I never have before with a city. I met ex-pats\
      \ living there on year-long visas, and realized maybe I could do it too, as\
      \ a gap year before grad school.\r\n\r\nSo I started talking about it, more\
      \ and more confidently, until one day I bought a one-way ticket to Sydney. I\
      \ put in four weeks\u2019 notice, did what else I could for my incredibly strong\
      \ clients, and spent time soaking up St. Louis. I set up trips to see friends\
      \ and family, and say year-long goodbyes, which is why I\u2019m heading to Denver,\
      \ LA, and SF. (I\u2019ll be going to Burning Man for the first time \u2013 any\
      \ tips??).\r\n\r\nGoodbyes have been rough. The weight of my decision is sinking\
      \ in as I realize how many special relationships I\u2019m leaving behind. But\
      \ I\u2019ve also realized that in order to grow, thrive, and learn I need to\
      \ intentionally place myself in conducive environments. I\u2019m fortunate to\
      \ be at a place in my life where I can easily change my reality. And right now\
      \ I need to take time to invest in myself so I can come back refreshed, with\
      \ a better sense of how to lovingly, sustainably invest in others again.\r\n\
      \r\nThat\u2019s my story. I\u2019m happy to share my blog. If you have any Sydney\
      \ connections who have room in their life for a new American friend, or just\
      \ a tour or some tips, I\u2019d be grateful. I\u2019ll be building a community\

<p>It&#8217;s really easy for me to fall into a way of thinking that keeps me moving in the same direction.  I don&#8217;t like how my life feels when I let that happen for too long, so I give myself projects.  This coupled with some mild obsessive compulsive tendencies causes me to fixate on the end goal until I&#8217;ve thoroughly exhausted the point of the project.  Sometimes this leaves me very satisfied with what I&#8217;ve done/made/experienced and other times I find myself oddly ashamed or empty.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t expect anyone to necessarily understand any of that, but I know how I feel when I&#8217;m in this kind of state and thought it could be helpful if others who might feel that way too knew they weren&#8217;t alone.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m working really hard on being vulnerable, too.  It&#8217;s a scary concept when you&#8217;ve spent your entire life believing (for good reason) that the best way to live is in a constant state of emotional vigilance.  I&#8217;m finding, though, that I&#8217;m not happy.  So I have made the decision to deliberately open myself up to all of the possibilities that vulnerability offers, both the good and the bad.  I try to remind myself that as painful as circumstances may get, they won&#8217;t kill me&#8230; and I&#8217;ll make my way through the worst.  Also, that it won&#8217;t be all bad&#8230; that I&#8217;m motivated by the good possibilities that I know exist.  It&#8217;s a foreign concept to me and difficult to execute throughout my life, but I&#8217;m committed to making that discomfort my new normal.</p>
<p>Speaking of projects, I have a couple of app ideas for smartphones that I really believe the world would benefit from but I&#8217;m not currently a developer.  I&#8217;m in the process of learning, but I don&#8217;t have the confidence in myself necessary to make these things the way I imagine them.  So, if you&#8217;re a developer and are open to partnering with me on one or two ideas, reach out to me and we can discuss how to make that happen.</p>
<p>I enjoy discussing meaningful topics:  politics, religion, ways to do life better&#8230;.  I also enjoy a lot of different media, from music to books and shows.  So if you&#8217;d like to talk about any of these things and you find that it&#8217;s difficult or awkward to find a place to discuss these topics without encountering negative people or experiences, feel free to reach out to me.</p>
<p>I have no advice for anyone, but I&#8217;m happy to collaborate with any of you to make life better for us all.</p>
<p>Be and Stay Well.</p>

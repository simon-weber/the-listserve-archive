    body: "It\u2019s really easy for me to fall into a way of thinking that keeps\
      \ me moving in the same direction.  I don\u2019t like how my life feels when\
      \ I let that happen for too long, so I give myself projects.  This coupled with\
      \ some mild obsessive compulsive tendencies causes me to fixate on the end goal\
      \ until I\u2019ve thoroughly exhausted the point of the project.  Sometimes\
      \ this leaves me very satisfied with what I\u2019ve done/made/experienced and\
      \ other times I find myself oddly ashamed or empty.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t expect\
      \ anyone to necessarily understand any of that, but I know how I feel when I\u2019\
      m in this kind of state and thought it could be helpful if others who might\
      \ feel that way too knew they weren\u2019t alone.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m working really\
      \ hard on being vulnerable, too.  It\u2019s a scary concept when you\u2019ve\
      \ spent your entire life believing (for good reason) that the best way to live\
      \ is in a constant state of emotional vigilance.  I\u2019m finding, though,\
      \ that I\u2019m not happy.  So I have made the decision to deliberately open\
      \ myself up to all of the possibilities that vulnerability offers, both the\
      \ good and the bad.  I try to remind myself that as painful as circumstances\
      \ may get, they won\u2019t kill me\u2026 and I\u2019ll make my way through the\
      \ worst.  Also, that it won\u2019t be all bad\u2026 that I\u2019m motivated\
      \ by the good possibilities that I know exist.  It\u2019s a foreign concept\
      \ to me and difficult to execute throughout my life, but I\u2019m committed\
      \ to making that discomfort my new normal.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of projects, I have\
      \ a couple of app ideas for smartphones that I really believe the world would\
      \ benefit from but I\u2019m not currently a developer.  I\u2019m in the process\
      \ of learning, but I don\u2019t have the confidence in myself necessary to make\
      \ these things the way I imagine them.  So, if you\u2019re a developer and are\
      \ open to partnering with me on one or two ideas, reach out to me and we can\
      \ discuss how to make that happen.\r\n\r\nI enjoy discussing meaningful topics:\
      \  politics, religion, ways to do life better\u2026.  I also enjoy a lot of\
      \ different media, from music to books and shows.  So if you\u2019d like to\
      \ talk about any of these things and you find that it\u2019s difficult or awkward\
      \ to find a place to discuss these topics without encountering negative people\
      \ or experiences, feel free to reach out to me.\r\n\r\nI have no advice for\
      \ anyone, but I\u2019m happy to collaborate with any of you to make life better\
      \ for us all.\r\n\r\nBe and Stay Well.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrandon\t\r\nListserve.brandon@gmail.com\t\

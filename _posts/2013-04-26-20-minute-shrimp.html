<p>Hello everyone! I am so fazed that I hit the lottery! I am responding to it late so I'm not sure they will ever post what I'm writing. I only have a few things to say.</p>
<p>* Shrimp is always best when cooked for at least 20 minutes.  <br />* People sometimes get me confused with PanCakes.  <br />* Some people wonder if we are one in the same.  <br />* Fazers always demand proof. <br />* PIHB <br />* What are you wearing today? <br />* In my free time I love to carelessly whisper. I belong to a great online forum. I spend most of my free time there. I feel very loved, but also hated at the same time.  <br />* Don't forget to smash it in the driveway. <br />* You know what happens up the back stairs... <br />* Double dot .. <br />* Please use the word Thank! at least once today. <br />* ...right over the handle bars. </p>
<p>And last but not least... <br />* rustycar.jpg  <br />* rustycar.jpg  <br />* rustycar.jpg </p>

<p class="meta">February 21 2013</p>

<p>I live in a country where entire sections of bookstores are dedicated to advice or self-improvement. Hell, in the late 90s we had a Billboard hit that was just an inspirational high-school graduation speech over a drum beat.</p>
<p>So there is nothing I can say here that hasn't already been said. But, the winter wind howling outside my windows reminds me of one of my favorite poems, so I'll leave you with that.</p>
<p> Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening <br />by Robert Frost <br />First published in New Hampshire in 1923   </p>
<p>Whose woods these are I think I know. <br />His house is in the village, though; <br />He will not see me stopping here <br />To watch his woods fill up with snow.</p>
<p>My little horse must think it's queer <br />To stop without a farmhouse near <br />Between the woods and frozen lake <br />The darkest evening of the year.</p>
<p>He gives his harness bells a shake <br />To ask if there's some mistake. <br />The only other sound's the sweep <br />Of easy wind and downy flake.</p>
<p>The woods are lovely, dark, and deep, <br />But I have promises to keep, <br />And miles to go before I sleep, <br />And miles to go before I sleep.</p>
<p>Thanks for the opportunity,</p>

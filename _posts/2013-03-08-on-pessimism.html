    \ a pessimist, you'll know that it can be frustrating at times and nearly impossible\
    \ to help them become more positive.\r\n\r\nHere are a few tips I learned over\
    \ the years:\r\n\r\nReward your failures: This works to return my mood/optimism\
    \ quickly and avoid those long periods of being jaded. It is too easy to fall\
    \ back into your comfort zone. The key is to avoid the temptation to \u201Cshut\
    \ down\u201D.\r\n\r\nCelebrate your successes:  This is how I make continuous\
    \ enthusiasm a habit, celebrating either outcome.\r\n\r\nThink long term: Every\
    \ year I write a report on how my family is doing and we use it as a way to reflect\
    \ on how our efforts have improved our situation. (Don't let long term thinking\
    \ overwhelm though, cling to progress and shy away from overly ambitious goals\
    \ at first.)\r\n\r\nFace your anxieties head on, use logic to convince yourself\
    \ of your emotional fallacies, and remember that no matter how much you want to\
    \ fight against optimism, you cannot deny optimists are generally happier and\
    \ more successful.\r\n\r\nI am a Software Engineer in my 30s out of Utah and just\
    \ had my first kid. Shout out to any other first time parents currently experiencing\

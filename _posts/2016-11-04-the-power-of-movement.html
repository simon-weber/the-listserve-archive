    body: "I began running many years ago as an attempt to lose weight.  It worked,\
      \ but it also opened up a new world for me into the power of movement.  My love\
      \ for running has grown over the years, so much so that it has become a focus\
      \ of reading and research into what I hope will become books and/or writings\
      \ in the future.\r\n     It started out so simply, with me trying every week\
      \ to run continuously just a quarter of a mile more than I had done the previous\
      \ week.  It added up quickly.  From there, I began to find out more about accomplished\
      \ marathoners and ultrarunners, then spiritual runners, such as the Marathon\
      \ Monks of Mt. Hiei.  I found works that told of the legend of Pheidippides,\
      \ running from Marathon to Athens, and how inspired such a run would have to\
      \ be to do so until your last breath.  I read of the Tarahumara.  I found Joseph\
      \ Campbell\u2019s writings and lectures beyond \"\"The Hero with a Thousand\
      \ Faces\"\" and it changed my perspective on life and how I/we live it.  I found\
      \ works about \u201Cinduced movement,\u201D practiced by such people as Thoreau,\
      \ Baudelaire, and Huxley, to name a few.  Great minds of history have been known\
      \ to jumpstart their research and philosophical quests by taking a walk or run\
      \ during the day, some with the assistance of narcotics and/or opiates (an experience\
      \ I highly recommend, no pun intended).\r\n     The power of Nature and the\
      \ outside world, in my humble opinion, cannot be denied.  Through running and\
      \ hiking, I have found solace, healing, creativity, new insights, original ideas,\
      \ plots for books, meditation, personal realizations, strength, and self-discipline.\
      \  There are studies which show the positive effects of movement on all sorts\
      \ of psychological disorders, from children with behavior disorders to soldiers\
      \ returning from war.  Movement as therapy is a practice too long ignored.\r\
      \n     My hope is that all of us around the world get up and move more, especially\
      \ in the great outdoors.  Our national parks, green spaces, and wilderness areas\
      \ are where we truly find ourselves by leaving the modern world behind and seeing\
      \ what we are capable of.  It is a mentally healing practice and its therapeutic\
      \ benefits cannot be denied.\r\n     My wife and I are embarking on our own\
      \ walking adventure next year; we will be quitting our four collective jobs\
      \ to hike the Appalachian Trail.  We are both excited and terrified for various\
      \ reasons.  We have been planning and saving for about three years.  We have\
      \ no children, no debt to speak of, older cars, no mortgage, and have begun\
      \ to pare down our possessions, all with the intent of starting over on the\
      \ trail and after, when we will move to a new location and begin a new life.\
      \  Sure, it\u2019ll take a 2,000-mile trek to do it, but if you want to get\
      \ somewhere new, you have to be willing to take the first steps.\r\n     I hope\
      \ all of you who take the time to read this are already lovers of the outdoors\
      \ or that you choose in the future to get out more.  Find your own hike, take\
      \ your own steps, and I think you will be amazed at where you end up and who\
      \ you become.\r\n\r\n     Here\u2019s to your first or next steps, all of you!\r\

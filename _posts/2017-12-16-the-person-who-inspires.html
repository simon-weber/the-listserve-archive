    body: "I would like to share with you all the story of the person who inspires\
      \ me the most. I just returned to the U.S. from 14 months living in Tanzania\
      \ working with a local organization that provides services to children and youth\
      \ with disabilities (now looking for a job in DC!). While I was there, I met\
      \ Shedrack. Shedrack works at another disability organization for youth in Tanzania,\
      \ but he is also the founder and director of a physiotherapy clinic for adults\
      \ with disabilities.\r\n\r\nIt all started because Shedrack realized that when\
      \ patients at the hospital reach the point where they are able to do physiotherapy,\
      \ they are discharged. According to World Bank data from 2012, Tanzania has\
      \ just 0.7 hospital beds and 0.03 physicians per 1000 people, compared with\
      \ 3 hospital beds and 2.5 physicians per 1000 people in the U.S. Hospitals are\
      \ overwhelmed and forced to discharge patients once their condition is stable.\
      \ This leaves patients to return home without regaining any basic mobility;\
      \ they often develop secondary complications that can be fatal.\r\n\r\nShedrack\
      \ created a clinic to serve these patients and named it Epignosis Physiotherapy\
      \ Clinic (EPT). His vision is to have EPT clinics in each district of Tanzania\
      \ so that every Tanzanian who is in need can access quality rehabilitation services.\r\
      \n\r\nPeople with disabilities account for approximately 15% of the world population,\
      \ and about 80% of people with disabilities live in low-income countries. EPT\
      \ is the only clinic providing physiotherapy services that are affordable for\
      \ all adults in the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania, an area with a population\
      \ of 1.64 million people.\r\n\r\nThe first EPT patient I met was a man named\
      \ Ahmed. In 2011, Ahmed had a stroke on a business trip to Uganda. After the\
      \ stroke, he could not stand or walk. When he returned to Tanzania, his wife\
      \ Miriam took him to a hospital for physical therapy. But the therapy at the\
      \ hospital was very expensive and Ahmed did not have health insurance. His family\
      \ spent all of their savings trying to find a doctor who could help him. There\
      \ are days when they cannot afford food or Ahmed's medication.\r\n\r\nShedrack\
      \ has now been working with Ahmed for almost two years and visits him at his\
      \ home three times per week to do exercises with him. Now Ahmed is able to sit\
      \ up and support himself. He is no longer in pain and sleeps through the night.\
      \ Recently Ahmed began using a wheelchair and now has the opportunity to go\
      \ outside for the first time in 6 years. The support that Ahmed and his family\
      \ have received from EPT is truly life changing.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt is really important\
      \ to take a step to do something, even if you have nothing,\u201D Shedrack says.\
      \ I wanted to share his story to show that anyone really can make a difference.\
      \ It doesn't have to be starting a clinic. It can be something that seems small,\
      \ like sending a friend a card or smiling at a stranger or calling your representative.\
      \ I know it sounds cheesy, but these things truly make a difference. Shedrack\
      \ tells me, \u201CLife is made up of the things you do every day. Some people\
      \ wait for the good day to come. But you can make every moment good, and when\
      \ you look back, you will see that you had good days.\u201D\r\n\r\nIf you would\
      \ like to support Shedrack's clinic, you can go to the YouCaring website and\
      \ search \"EPT\" and it will be the first result. Thank you for reading his\
      \ story, I hope it is your inspiration to keep going.\r\n\r\nAlex\r\nHopefully\

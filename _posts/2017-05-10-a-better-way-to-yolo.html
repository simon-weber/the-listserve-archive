      \ strongest unique password since it's the key to all your other accounts. Need\
      \ to reset a password? With access to your email, you get access to everything.\
      \ When a website needs you to sign up, use ephemeral user accounts from BugMeNot.\
      \ Use Two factor authentication on things that matter.\r\n\r\n2. Identify Phishy\
      \ content\r\nLearn how to identify phishing emails. This may include strange\
      \ senders, weird links, misspelled text, or unusual requests. If the email comes\
      \ from someone you know, and it contains a weird request, verify through a secondary\
      \ source whether they sent the message or not. If you get a file that is suspicious,\
      \ open it in Google Drive so your computer doesn\u2019t get affected.\r\nYou\
      \ can report phishing content to the US Department of Homeland Security\u2019\
      s (DHS) Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT).\r\n\r\n3. Block ads\r\nWhile\
      \ websites do get most of their revenue from ad clicks, malicious ads are a\
      \ major vector of attack that can cause legitimate websites to issue out spam.\
      \ The best approach is to limit your ad exposure on websites. Check out Pi-Hole\
      \ if you\u2019re interested in a more sophisticated setup.\r\n\r\n4. Stay updated\r\
      \nEvery week new vulnerabilities are found in common applications for every\
      \ platform. If you\u2019re interested, CERT produces a weekly list of found\
      \ vulnerabilities in applications, ranking from mundane to can-totally-pwn-your-system.\
      \ The common way people get infected is through the use of common vulnerabilities,\
      \ so as long as you update your software you\u2019ll be up to date on common\
      \ patches.\r\n\r\n5. Backup\r\nRansomware is so sophisticated now that even\
      \ the FBI suggests you simply pay up. To be protected if you were to be infected\
      \ by ransomware, be sure to regularly backup your files. Locally updating is\
      \ better for privacy (on an external hard-drive or DVD), but cloud backups provide\
      \ you redundancy. A major problem with cloud backups is the fact that they can\
      \ be breached (recall the fappening).\r\n\r\n6. Minimize your attack surface\r\
      \nThe less programs you have installed on your mobile or desktop device, the\
      \ fewer accounts you have at random websites, and the less content you share\
      \ online all minimize the ways people can get to you. There are trade-offs to\
      \ these decisions, but that line is different for each person. If you stay at\
      \ the lower level of that threshold, you\u2019ll be better off.\r\n------\r\n\
      If you want to discuss crypto, programming languages, security, or anything\
      \ else, hit me up. These days I want to understand Homotopy Type Theory, prove\
      \ universal composability of some protocol, and formally verify obfuscated-LLVM.\r\

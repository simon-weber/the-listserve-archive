<p>Google translate is great, and I use it extensively while learning Spanish. But there's only so much it can do. There are some words of a language which remain untranslatable. Here are some of my favourites:</p>
<p>Duende (Spanish)- On a translator, it'll show "elf". It is actually the spark of divine inspiration, expressing itself out of one&#8217;s heart, or the involuntary feeling of awe, in reaction to an inspiring piece of art or music.</p>
<p>Tenalach (Gaeilge)- The relationship one has with the earth, the air, the water. A deep connection that makes you one with nature.</p>
<p>Gem&#252;tlich (German)- Translates as "comfortable", but it is the sort of comfortable exhibited by a warm house full of people who love you; when you are happy and relaxed.</p>
<p>Ya'aburnee (Arabic)- Literally translates as "You bury me."  The declaration of one's hope that they'll die before another person, because of how difficult it would be to live without them.</p>
<p>Koi No Yokan (Japanese)- The feeling you can get when meeting a person for the first time, that you will fall in love with them. Different from "love at first sight", as it does not say that love already exists, only the knowledge that it WILL happen later.</p>
<p>On that note, I'll sign off. Hopefully you will find these words as beautiful as I did.</p>

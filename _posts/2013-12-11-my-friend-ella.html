<p>I'll keep this short because that's the kind of emails I like :)</p>
<p>My friend Ella is a 7 year old girl suffering from NF1, a condition that causes a lot of tumors to grow</p>
<p>She has a Facebook page called "Hope for Ella" where you can read about her, and see the amazing and selfless things that she does (organising a Christmas party for kids affected by Hurricane Sandy, making sandwiches for her homeless friends in Philidelphia)</p>
<p>If you have a minute, it'd really make her day if you liked her Facebook page "Hope for Ella"</p>
<p><br />If you have more than a minute, you should send her your favourite joke - I'm sure she'd love it</p>
<p><br />Thanks and have a great day!</p>

    <p>I am trying to figure out my next professional move and have thus been meeting
    with as many people as possible to get various perspectives. One specific conversation
    I had was particularly refreshing, so I wanted to share that with you. I was speaking

    <p>This sentence struck me for a few reasons. First, I often have trouble making
    decisions, so it was probably a good thing for me to hear that while other people''s
    advice is important, it ultimately comes down to me. Second, I think it is sometimes
    important to realize that as much as you plan, some things are beyond your control,
    and everything will not happen exactly as you had envisioned. That''s obviously
    not to say that you shouldn''t try. But still, it''s probably a healthy thing
    to keep in mind. Third, I thought it was cool that he mentioned God. I grew up
    in a religious environment, so that is certainly not a foreign concept to me.
    But even so, I have found that few people actually talk about God. There is plenty

    sometimes gets lost in all of that. So I was kind of impressed that he threw that

    me stop and think for a minute, which is certainly something I don''t do often
    enough.</p>

    <p>What has made you stop and think? Something that happened, something that someone
    said? Definitely doesn''t have to be on the topic of religion. Or, on an unrelated
    and lighter note, anyone have any fun/crazy/creative date ideas?</p>

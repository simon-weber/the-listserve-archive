<p>Hello Listserve!</p>
<p>I'm writing this from Reykjavik, Iceland. I arrived here from NYC yesterday, and leave for Paris tomorrow. I'm from San Francisco, originally. I am 25. (not relevant at all to the content of my message, but a little background info is always fun..)</p>
<p>A few things:</p>
<p>1) The world is small. We have so many experiences/emotions in common. Think about that the next time you feel alone - you're not. </p>
<p>2) Be good to your family. Your time with them is not guaranteed. But when it ends - remember, its not the number of years, it's the quality of those years. (rest in peace dad, 4/17/13, I still miss you - and my heart and thoughts goes out to those who are or have been affected by any type of cancer. You are cared for!)</p>
<p>3) Go easy on yourself. It's your first time through this life.;)</p>
<p>4) Whatever it is - you'll be ok. I promise. :)</p>
<p>With lots of jetlag and love,</p>

<p>PS - message me Paris travel tips! I've never been:) </p>

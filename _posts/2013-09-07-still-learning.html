      <p>I''m writing this from Reykjavik, Iceland. I arrived here from NYC yesterday,
      and leave for Paris tomorrow. I''m from San Francisco, originally. I am 25.
      (not relevant at all to the content of my message, but a little background info
      is always fun..)</p>

      <p>A few things:</p>

      <p>1) The world is small. We have so many experiences/emotions in common. Think
      about that the next time you feel alone - you''re not. </p>

      <p>2) Be good to your family. Your time with them is not guaranteed. But when
      it ends - remember, its not the number of years, it''s the quality of those
      years. (rest in peace dad, 4/17/13, I still miss you - and my heart and thoughts
      goes out to those who are or have been affected by any type of cancer. You are
      cared for!)</p>

      <p>3) Go easy on yourself. It''s your first time through this life.;)</p>

      <p>4) Whatever it is - you''ll be ok. I promise. :)</p>

      <p>With lots of jetlag and love,</p>

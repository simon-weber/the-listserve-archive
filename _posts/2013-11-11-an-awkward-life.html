<p>I&#8217;m still not sure what the title of my (auto)biography is going to be, but the subtitle will most certainly be An Awkward Life. Perhaps I&#8217;m starring on a reality TV show and don&#8217;t know it yet, but I find myself in a fair number of truly awkward and comical situations. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s my penchant for saying the first thing that comes to mind or just some karmatic effect from a previous life, but regardless, I&#8217;ve got a lot of good fodder for my future stand-up comedy routine.</p>
<p>My most recent I&#8217;m-pretty-sure-the-Universe-is-laughing-at-me moment happened last month when I was en route to what was most certainly going to be a break-up conversation. I was getting out of my car to meet my then boyfriend when I heard the distinct sound of fabric tearing. I looked down to see a hole in the crotch of my pants. The timing couldn&#8217;t have been worse, but it did give me a few minutes to laugh at myself before a truly unpleasant conversations. These things happen to me more often than I can count, but I have come to enjoy and embrace the comedic relief it brings to otherwise dull or unpleasant situations.. When I came out to my mom over dinner, she thought I was playing a practical joke for a while. Trying to prove that it wasn&#8217;t a joke proved pretty uncomfortable.</p>
<p>I could fill the rest of this e-mail with some of my favorite stories, but I&#8217;ll try and keep it brief. I&#8217;d love to hear from you guys on a host of things. I&#8217;m a total and complete news junkie who is obsessed with politics and public policy. So, a few things I&#8217;d like to hear from you about:</p>
<p>1) My favorite book at the moment is Nudge by Cass Sunstein. The book basically discusses choice architecture and how we can build a smarter planet to make up for the fact that we humans often make decisions that aren&#8217;t in our best long-term interests (think saving for retirement, eating healthy foods, climate change, etc.) If you&#8217;ve read Nudge or have an interest or experience in designing better systems of any kind, I&#8217;d love to hear about your work.</p>
<p>2) What are your awkward and comical stories?</p>
<p>3) I&#8217;m interested in how people work, particularly GTD and organizational strategies. Feel free to share some good advice/tips in this arena. I&#8217;ll also accept any life advice you&#8217;d like to give in general.</p>
<p>4) I work in fundraising/development, focused primarily in politics and the non-profit world. If you work in these fields, I&#8217;d love to connect.</p>
<p>5) Finally, if you know any single and awesome gay guys in the DC-area, I love awkward first dates. They make for the best stories.</p>
<p><br />Thanks for reading, y&#8217;all!</p>

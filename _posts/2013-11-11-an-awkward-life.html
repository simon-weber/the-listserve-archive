    \ in a fair number of truly awkward and comical situations. I\u2019m not sure\
    \ if it\u2019s my penchant for saying the first thing that comes to mind or just\
    \ some karmatic effect from a previous life, but regardless, I\u2019ve got a lot\

    \ I\u2019m-pretty-sure-the-Universe-is-laughing-at-me moment happened last month\
    \ when I was en route to what was most certainly going to be a break-up conversation.\
    \ I was getting out of my car to meet my then boyfriend when I heard the distinct\

    \ and public policy. So, a few things I\u2019d like to hear from you about:\r\n\
    \r\n1) My favorite book at the moment is Nudge by Cass Sunstein. The book basically\
    \ discusses choice architecture and how we can build a smarter planet to make\
    \ up for the fact that we humans often make decisions that aren\u2019t in our\
    \ best long-term interests (think saving for retirement, eating healthy foods,\
    \ climate change, etc.) If you\u2019ve read Nudge or have an interest or experience\
    \ in designing better systems of any kind, I\u2019d love to hear about your work.\r\
    \n\r\n2) What are your awkward and comical stories?\r\n\r\n3) I\u2019m interested\
    \ in how people work, particularly GTD and organizational strategies. Feel free\
    \ to share some good advice/tips in this arena. I\u2019ll also accept any life\
    \ advice you\u2019d like to give in general.\r\n\r\n4) I work in fundraising/development,\
    \ focused primarily in politics and the non-profit world. If you work in these\
    \ fields, I\u2019d love to connect.\r\n\r\n5) Finally, if you know any single\
    \ and awesome gay guys in the DC-area, I love awkward first dates. They make for\
    \ the best stories.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, y\u2019all!\r\n\r\n-Connor\r\

    strategies. Feel free to share some good advice/tips in this arena. I&#8217;ll

    <p>Here are a short series of notes that I would like to share with you all.</p>

    <p>The types of people I enjoy:</p>

    <p>The go-getters, the wild ones, the spontaneous, the courageous and the brave,
    the thinkers and the doers, the optimists and the non-conformists and above all
    else - the ones that know themselves.</p>

    <p>OTP22: Cryptography, Svalbard &amp; Dead Drops:</p>

    <p>Almost a year to this day I started working with a small team to try and solve
    the mystery behind OTP22. OTP22 is an ARG (Alternate Reality Game) that has gone
    to extraordinary lengths to keep its MO a secret. We still do not fully know what
    it is all about. The latest dead drop is in Bulgaria at location 42.0552, 25.5927,
    if you are near please email me. More info can be found on our Wiki or through
    our IRC Chan: freenode.net #ARG</p>

    <p>Board games:</p>

    <p>I feel like board games have fallen out of the mainstream now that we have
    computers. I recently got back into them and you know what? They are great fun!
    It really brings a great social aspect to any evening. My favorites at the moment
    are: Elder Signs, Settlers of Catan and Pandemic. I also want to try Formula D,
    Game of Thrones &amp; Twilight Struggle. For anyone interested, you should really
    check out Wil Wheaton&#8217;s series on Youtube called Tabletop.</p>

    <p><br />Apps I use (MAC):</p>

    <p>- QuickCal: Hotkey: Ctrl + Shift + R. This allows me to quickly add things
    to my calendar or reminders list.</p>

    <p>- Alarms: Hotkey: Cmd + E. Reminders that I make with QuickCal are displayed
    in a panel dropdown with this app.</p>

    <p><br />The Future:</p>

    <p>At our current rate of consumption and with the world&#8217;s population growing
    exponentially I fear the tipping point is near. The greed of men has got in the
    way of sustainability. This planet is all we have, letting corporations ruin it
    solely for profits is like letting a bully get your lunch money, and your parents
    worked hard for that money damn it! Don&#8217;t feel as though you are powerless

    100,000 David&#8217;s, and one of those David&#8217;s is bound to have a stone
    that hits hard.</p>

    <p>Parting thoughts:</p>

    <p>Pay it forward and always remember how far you&#8217;ve come.</p>

    body: "(TL;DR\u2014this one is kind of an experiment, scroll to the bottom for\
      \ the punchline.)There\u2019s a scene from the movie Network (1976), where TV\
      \ news anchor Howard Beale has a series of epic on-air rants about the uncertain\
      \ state of the world. He urges his viewers: \u201CI want you to get up now.\
      \ I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right\
      \ now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell\u2026\u201D\
      \r\n\r\nThen he says the line maybe you\u2019ve heard\u2014\u201CI\u2019m as\
      \ mad as hell, and I\u2019m not going to take this anymore!\u201D He stands\
      \ up, repeating the line with increasing intensity. The movie cuts to a shot\
      \ of an apartment complex, and people start opening up their windows. It\u2019\
      s hard not to feel a sense of excitement when they start hollering out their\
      \ windows, it almost feels like it\u2019s really happening.\r\n\r\nBut I\u2019\
      m not so interested in Howard Beale, or the \u201Cmad as hell\u201D speech itself\u2014\
      some of which is uncomfortably similar to the populism of a certain American\
      \ political candidate. What\u2019s really striking to me is how our use of broadcast\
      \ technology has changed since the '70s. All those people hearing the same message\
      \ from their TVs, all at once. And with the ethical weight of Watergate-era\
      \ news journalism. It kinda feels like we\u2019ve lost that capability with\
      \ DVRs, social media, and Internet streaming.\r\n\r\nI mean, we also have all\
      \ this new stuff\u2014so many new (relatively) inexpensive capabilities that\
      \ let more of us reach many more people. Today\u2019s Internet mega-viewerships\
      \ surely outnumber 1970s TV, but it\u2019s also interesting how many smaller\
      \ in-between scales we have now. The Listserve is on that spectrum, somewhere\
      \ between a receiving a postcard and browsing through trending hashtags.\r\n\
      \r\nI\u2019m curious: what\u2019s the present-day equivalent of sharing a common\
      \ acoustic space, like those apartment-dwellers in Network? Who are we all?\
      \ Where do we live? What could we achieve if we acted in concert somehow?\r\n\
      \r\nInstead of yelling a slogan out of our windows (basically a 1970s retweet),\
      \ I have a couple other ideas.\r\n\r\n- Let\u2019s meet up IRL! We could select\
      \ a handful of central locations and convene at a common time to build stuff/get\
      \ weird/stare at each other awkwardly/make art/plan to overthrow the government/etc.\r\
      \n- What about a backchannel? I\u2019ve been working on a new project that I\u2019\
      m eager to try out. It\u2019s a group chat, kind of a pared-down, SMS-based\
      \ Twitter.\r\n\r\n(Insert here: the part where I pitch my project, Small Data.\
      \ It\u2019s a data cooperative I\u2019m starting up with some friends, a collectively\
      \ run alternative to cloud-based-advertising-ware.)\r\n\r\nJust reply to this\
      \ email and I'll let you know when I figure out how this meetup(s) thing will\
      \ go. If you\u2019re feeling adventurous and want to try out the backchannel\u2014\
      that part is already working! Send an SMS message to (646) 846-4777 and you\u2019\
      ll be able to pseudonymously chat with other people who sign up.\r\n\r\nAnd\
      \ for my money, Ned Beatty\u2019s boardroom speech in Network deserves to be\
      \ every bit as famous as the \u201Cmad as hell\u201D rant. Look it up if you\
      \ haven\u2019t seen it!\r\n\r\nDan Phiffer\r\ndan@phiffer.org\r\nCalifornia\r\

      \ co-op program. Although my university years have played a key role in shaping\

      \ with you that truly makes me who I am today.\r\n\r\nToday, I want to share\
      \ a little story about two special heroes in my life: my mom and dad. About\

      \ children\u2019s education and success their absolute priority in life. It\
      \ wasn\u2019t just the big sacrifices. I remember waking my dad up at 2:00 am\

    body: '<p>Hi Everyone!</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m 20 years old and currently a third year student at the University
      of Waterloo.  I absolutely love my University because of the great opportunities
      it leads me to. By the time I graduate in 2016, I&#8217;ll have approximately
      a year and half of working experience all thanks to the co-op program. Although
      my university years have played a key role in shaping my identity, and I could
      go on about that for a while, I want to share something with you that truly
      makes me who I am today.</p>

      <p>Today, I want to share a little story about two special heroes in my life:
      my mom and dad. About 12 years ago, my parents decided to move to Canada from
      Kuwait for the sole purpose of their kids&#8217; education. Coming to Canada,
      at the age of eight, I couldn&#8217;t ever comprehend what this would mean for
      our family. My dad decided to stay back for a while as he had been doing really
      well in his career back in Kuwait. My mom took care of us, helped us with our
      homework and ran the household here. Their time apart for 10 years meant that
      they made their children&#8217;s education and success their absolute priority
      in life. It wasn&#8217;t just the big sacrifices. I remember waking my dad up
      at 2:00 am his time, in Kuwait, to go on MSN and help me with a physics problem
      I had been struggling with. My parents&#8217; intense love and dedication for
      us gives me the strength to push my limits and fears aside to continuously strive
      for more. The education, morals, and values they have instilled in me have made
      me who I am today &#8211; a leader and a fighter. And I can&#8217;t thank them
      enough, except to acknowledge and honour everything that they have done and
      continue to do for me.</p>

      <p>Currently, I&#8217;m taking a course on Coursera called &#8220;Programming
      for Everyone&#8221;. I have no clue why, but educational systems fascinate me&#8230;and
      what interests me more are the differences between them, across cultures. This
      course is teaching me basic Python programming skills through data analysis.

      \ between 75% and 99% of each roost it hits. Remember that the devastating Black\

      \ you to think of your least favorite animal - maybe that\u2019s a bat, a spider,\
      \ a lizard, or a shark - and aim to learn a new fact about it every day for\
      \ a week. What ecological services does it provide? How does it communicate?\
      \ How has its species evolved? Maybe I\u2019m too idealistic, but I think the\
      \ best way to start pursuing a more rounded approach to conservation is to find\
      \ ways to get excited about the animals we might not be jazzed about ordinarily\
      \ because of how we've been conditioned to perceive them.\r\n\r\nIn a similar\
      \ vein, I\u2019m hoping to spend time in the near future traveling to different\
      \ communities around the world (on a very low budget) that react to bats across\

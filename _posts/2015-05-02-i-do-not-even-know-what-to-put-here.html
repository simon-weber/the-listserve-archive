    body: '<p>Hello,</p>

      <p>The reason why I read the Listserve emails is not for the stories, the anecdotes,
      the new insights or the advice. What interests me is the question: what do people
      write when they have the chance to say something to a lot of people? And, why
      do they choose that particular topic?</p>

      <p>If I were to summarize the different responses people gave over the years,
      I would say that they most often use one of the following forms: this is what
      I do, this is who I am, this happened to me, this is what I love, this helped
      me, this could help you, this is funny or this tastes very good.</p>

      <p>So, what does this say about us? Well, frankly, I don''t know. What I do
      know is that I miss one kind of category. This category entails emails about
      the Listserve itself. No lengthy discussion on this peculiar, virtual platform.
      No comprehensive study on the way people answer the Listserve''s request. Don''t
      worry, I am not going to start now, but it is kind of interesting, isn''t it?</p>

      <p>I, for one, always end up with questions like these. With ''questions like
      these'' I mean questions that play at some sort of meta-level. I cannot look
      at something without being aware of the way I am looking. Or, more or less concrete
      example, when I am having a dicussion I often end up discussing the way we are
      discussing. This not infrequently to the frustration of the one sitting opposit
      of me. With the Listserve this is the same. Even though I somethimes enjoy the
      content, I always wander off. Why do people invent things like the Listserve,
      and why is nobody writing about this? Are other people wondering the same, and
      do they also wonder if other people are wondering about what they are wondering
      about?</p>

      <p>I, as you might have guessed, can stay in metapotamia all day long. Not in
      the sense that I have the capacity for it, but in the sense that I enjoy it.
      For me it is like using a shovel. When done using it you often just have a hole
      in the ground, and, well, that isn''t much to show for. You can try and sit
      in it, but it probably isn&#8217;t very comfortable. Often, when you start digging,
      all you find is another layer of dirt. Dirt not meaning something purely negative
      of course. Sometimes you find something you wouldn''t find above ground, sometimes
      you hit rock bottom. But it''s always good excercise.</p>

      <p>This very vague analogy may be the reason why the Listserve email only saying
      &#8220;Buy a bulldozer&#8221; still intrigues me.</p>

      <p>On purpose or not, I leave many questions open. If you, despite this, feel
      like responding, I will gladly read it. Me and my mind are starting up a business,
      so everything that can spark up anything is welcome.  I might even send an email
      back depending on, well, unkown future things.</p>

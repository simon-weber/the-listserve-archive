    body: "1. Make a list of everything that\u2019s brilliant, try not to add things\

      \ my list includes: Jim Dale\u2019s voice when he reads Harry Potter and the\
      \ fact that the unicorn is the national animal of Scotland (seriously, you can\
      \ look this up.)\r\n\r\n2. Take a philosophy class. I took a class called Ethics\
      \ and the Rwandan Genocide at summer camp (shout out to any Med-o-larkers that\
      \ read this list). Taking a class on ethics was one of the most interesting\
      \ things I have ever done.\r\n\r\n3. Listen to as much music as possible. Don\u2019\
      t limit yourself to what\u2019s on the top 40s, or just generally on the radio.\
      \ Personally my two favorite bands are Coheed & Cambria (shout out to any children\

      \ stand-up comedian, there\u2019s nothing better than a good laugh. My favorite\
      \ is Scottish Comedian, Daniel Sloss.\r\n\r\n5. Find and listen to a really\
      \ good podcast. Now I know most people are busy talking about Serial right now,\
      \ but I really like comedy podcasts (especially at the gym). My current favorites\
      \ include The Carl Donnelly and Chris Martin Comedy Podcast and Anna Faris is\

      \ people wouldn\u2019t know much about. For instance I have a weird encyclopedic\

      \ an adrenaline rush. It could be something that just really excites you, or\
      \ it could be the thing that terrifies you most. Personally, my favorite rush\
      \ comes from getting onstage and singing with my band.\r\n\r\n8. Travel. I know\
      \ this one is on almost everyone\u2019s list, but that\u2019s just because the\
      \ world is an amazing place, and everyone should try and experience it.\r\n\r\
      \n9. Reach out to a stranger, be it at a coffee shop or even on Tinder. You\
      \ never know who you could meet and what kind of conversation you could end\

      \ and yet it seems to be one of the hardest things to do. Just smile when you\

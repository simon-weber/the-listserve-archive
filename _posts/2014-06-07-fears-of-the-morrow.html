      <p>Tomorrow is a human a thing.  For other minds there is only now.  But not
      for us.</p>

      <p>We sleep and wake and live our lives by tides and shapes of nights and days
      and nights.</p>

      <p>Tomorrow is our dance; the steps of our rhythms with legs astride.</p>

      <p>Because it''s pain that teaches best, we fear the morrow.  And so we should.</p>

      <p>Yet tomorrow is the promise of a better thing.</p>

      <p>I live now.  Fears of the morrow mine are now.  But my dreams too come true.</p>

      <p>My dreams too come true.</p>

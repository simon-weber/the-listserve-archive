    body: "I'd learned the trick from my cousin the day before. We were sitting on\
      \ the playroom floor at my Granny's house; two parakeets chittering away behind\
      \ us. I told her my family was going to Stanley Park the next day, and about\
      \ how badly I wanted to feed the squirrels.\r\n\r\n\"I know how you can get\
      \ them to come up to you\" she said, cracking gum.\r\n\r\n\"You take two coins\
      \ - a nickel and a dime - and you click their sides together. Squirrels hear\
      \ it and they think it sounds like nuts being cracked open. They'll come right\
      \ up to you.\"\r\n\r\nShe paused for emphasis. \"I bet you could pet them if\
      \ you wanted.\"\r\n\r\nI WAS SO IN.\r\n\r\nFor the next eighteen hours, I never\
      \ put down my change purse. I held it so tightly I wore little sequin indents\
      \ into my sweaty kid palm. Its 15 cent contents were the key to making my nine-year-old\
      \ squirrel-obsessed dreams come true. I would feed one, it would let me pet\
      \ it, and then it would come home with me and we\u2019d be best friends forever.\r\
      \n\r\nAs far as kid plans went, it was pretty foolproof.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\
      We arrived at the park the next morning, dew slick on the cold spring grass.\
      \ I bounded out of the family station wagon with singular purpose.\r\n\r\n\"\
      Heather, wait!\" my mom called from the lineup at the snack cart. \"You can't\
      \ call them without the peanuts!\"\r\n\r\nI ignored her. We were finally here!\
      \ AND HERE...THERE BE SQUIRRELS!\r\n\r\nI pulled my nickel and dime out of my\
      \ change purse and began gently clicking them together.\r\n\r\nWithin 20 seconds,\
      \ my siren song had entranced four squirrels. They hopped over expectantly,\
      \ noses twitching, eyes bright.\r\n\r\nI remember thinking they were a lot bigger\
      \ than I'd expected\u2014more like small cats\u2014and sleek and black instead\
      \ of scruffy and brown. I remember starting to worry that perhaps the Wonderful\
      \ World of Disney\u2014the TV show I watched religiously every Sunday night\
      \ at 6pm\u2014had fudged the truth about how friendly and safe woodland creatures\
      \ were. I remember my mother yelling \"Jesus Heather, stop!\" and I remember\
      \ mentally agreeing with her and somehow not being able to relay that information\
      \ to my still clicking hands.\r\n\r\nThe next part is a bit of a blur.\r\n\r\
      \nThe way my mother tells it, one of the squirrels decided to claim the nuts\
      \ I was clearly hiding and jumped on to my leg, clinging by its claws to my\
      \ corduroy overalls. In an instant I transformed from a quiet, polite, slightly\
      \ prissy little girl to a spittle-flecked maniac. As my legs and arms flailed,\
      \ trying desperately to dislodge the squirrel, I began hurling out a heaving,\
      \ obscene cloud of f-bombs and s-bangs so loud and so dense that some say it\
      \ still hovers over Lost Lagoon on misty spring evenings.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\
      Years later and decades older, I find myself back at Stanley Park on a bright,\
      \ dewy spring day. Birds are chirruping happily, waves are lapping and squirrels\
      \ are doing squirrelly things. As I walk up to a concession stand to buy coffee,\
      \ I think briefly about trying my luck with them again.\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful day,\
      \ isn't it?\" said the smiling gent behind the counter. \"Absolutely\" I reply.\r\
      \n\r\nHe hands me the coffee, and plunks down my change on the metal napkin\
      \ holder. It makes an all-too-familiar clink.\r\n\r\n\"Looks like you've made\
      \ a friend already\" he quips.\r\n\r\nI don't even need to turn around to know\
      \ what's behind me. And I don't even realize it as the words start to pour out\
      \ of me.\r\n\r\n\"Oh F---\r\n\r\nHeather\r\nh.eatherlibby@gmail.com\r\nVancouver\r\

    body: "The Jewel\r\n\r\nThere is this cave\r\nIn the air behind my body\r\nThat\
      \ nobody is going to touch:\r\nA cloister, a silence\r\nClosing around a blossom\
      \ of fire.\r\nWhen I stand upright in the wind,\r\nMy bones turn to dark emeralds.\r\
      \n\r\n\r\nNorthern Pike\r\n\r\nAll right. Try this,\r\nThen. Every body\r\n\
      I know and care for,\r\nAnd every body\r\nElse is going\r\nTo die in a loneliness\r\
      \nI can't imagine and a pain\r\nI don't know. We had\r\nTo go on living. We\r\
      \nUntangled the net, we slit\r\nThe body of this fish\r\nOpen from the hinge\
      \ of the tail\r\nTo a place beneath the chin\r\nI wish I could sing of.\r\n\
      I would just as soon we let\r\nThe living go on living.\r\nAn old poet whom\
      \ we believe in\r\nSaid the same thing, and so\r\nWe paused among the dark cattails\
      \ and prayed\r\nFor the muskrats,\r\nFor the ripples below their tails,\r\n\
      For the little movements that we knew the crawdads were making\r\nunder water,\r\
      \nFor the right-hand wrist of my cousin who is a policeman.\r\nWe prayed for\
      \ the game warden's blindness.\r\nWe prayed for the road home.\r\nWe ate the\
      \ fish.\r\nThere must be something very beautiful in my body,\r\nI am so happy.\r\
      \n\r\n\r\nA Blessing\r\n\r\nJust off the highway to Rochester, Minnesota,\r\n\
      Twilight bounds softly forth on the grass.\r\nAnd the eyes of those two Indian\
      \ ponies\r\nDarken with kindness.\r\nThey have come gladly out of the willows\r\
      \nTo welcome my friend and me.\r\nWe step over the barbed wire into the pasture\r\
      \nWhere they have been grazing all day, alone.\r\nThey ripple tensely, they\
      \ can hardly contain their happiness\r\nThat we have come.\r\nThey bow shyly\
      \ as wet swans. They love each other.\r\nThere is no loneliness like theirs.\r\
      \nAt home once more,\r\nThey begin munching the young tufts of spring in the\
      \ darkness.\r\nI would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms,\r\nFor she\
      \ has walked over to me\r\nAnd nuzzled my left hand.\r\nShe is black and white,\r\
      \nHer mane falls wild on her forehead,\r\nAnd the light breeze moves me to caress\
      \ her long ear\r\nThat is delicate as the skin over a girl\u2019s wrist.\r\n\
      Suddenly I realize\r\nThat if I stepped out of my body I would break\r\nInto\
      \ blossom.\r\n\r\n\r\nHook\r\n\r\nI was only a young man\r\nIn those days. On\
      \ that evening\r\nThe cold was so God damned\r\nBitter there was nothing.\r\n\
      Nothing. I was in trouble\r\nWith a woman, and there was nothing\r\nThere but\
      \ me and dead snow.\r\n\r\nI stood on the street corner\r\nIn Minneapolis, lashed\r\
      \nThis way and that.\r\nWind rose from some pit,\r\nHunting me.\r\nAnother bus\
      \ to Saint Paul\r\nWould arrive in three hours,\r\nIf I was lucky.\r\n\r\nThen\
      \ the young Sioux\r\nLoomed beside me, his scars\r\nWere just my age.\r\n\r\n\
      Ain't got no bus here\r\nA long time, he said.\r\nYou got enough money\r\nTo\
      \ get home on?\r\n\r\nWhat did they do\r\nTo your hand? I answered.\r\nHe raised\
      \ up his hook into the terrible starlight\r\nAnd slashed the wind.\r\n\r\nOh,\
      \ that? he said.\r\nI had a bad time with a woman. Here,\r\nYou take this.\r\
      \n\r\nDid you ever feel a man hold\r\nSixty-five cents\r\nIn a hook,\r\nAnd\
      \ place it\r\nGently\r\nIn your freezing hand?\r\n\r\nI took it.\r\nIt wasn't\
      \ the money I needed.\r\nBut I took it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCongratulations if you\

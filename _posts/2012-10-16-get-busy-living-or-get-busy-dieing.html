<p>I'll keep my submission to the listserve short and sweet, for your viewing/brain scratching pleasure. Your boss can thank me for getting you back to work about two hundred words sooner. I'll just share two of my favorite quotes.</p>
<p>"In the end, the universe tends to unfold as it should"  and "There are no gods, no devils, no angels, no heaven or hell. There is only our natural world. Religion is but myth and superstition that hardens hearts and enslaves minds."</p>
<p>Think about it. Oh, and if by any chance any of these subscribers are NHL players and/or owners; End this damn lockout. I miss hockey.  Go Sharks! Go Niners! Go SF Giants! Go Earthquakes!</p>
<p>And if you've actually taken the time to read this; send me a shout back!  I'd love to know where in the world this message ends up. </p>

<p>P.S- Follow your heart and be patient. Good things come to those who wait. </p>

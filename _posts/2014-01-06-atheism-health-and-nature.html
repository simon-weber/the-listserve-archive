      Language program, aka I don''t have much time to put into this email. :(</p>

      <p>Some things I''ve been thinking about that I would love discussing with people:</p>

      <p>1) I''m an atheist, and I have a lot of trouble dealing with the fact that
      I''m going to die.  I was wondering if there were other atheists that had this
      problem (and overcame it?) who could give me advice!</p>

      <p>2) I''m very interested in food/nutrition/health.  I''m a vegan, and I love
      to cook and eat healthy!  Its sad that the majority of people eat like crap,
      and I''d love to brainstorm ways to change this!  (I have a vegan/vegetarian
      food blog by the way so let me know if you want to see it and i''ll send you
      a link!)</p>

      <p>3) I struggle a lot with the idea of "what is natural?".  I want to be as
      natural as possible, but couldn''t one argue that everything a human does is
      by definition natural?  </p>

      <p>I really wanted to send some profound email about healthiness or whatever,
      but since I don''t have time this is the best I can do.  Sorry!  Hope some of
      you would like to chat!  Since I''m in China for January, I might not be able
      to respond for a while, but I will definitely get back to you in February.</p>

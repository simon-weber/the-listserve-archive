      everyday!</p>

      <p>I see many of the emails here are from people (mostly younger than myself)
      who are on the verge of some great adventure, leaving for school, traveling
      the world, starting a new business (that surely will someday change world) I''m
      here to say that some parts of life are not as exciting, and that''s ok to.
      It''s ok to live in a small town, not travel the world, or be the next big business
      venture, it''s ok to work the same job for many years or be a stay at home parent.
      These are the people that make the world tick, these are the nurses, and garbagemen
      and factory workers, the cops and firemen and salesclerks, they are the volunteers
      and fundraisers and hot lunch makers. These are the people who keep things running
      and clean, and keep the safeguards in place, they are the steady, and the quiet
      population that give the travelers, and dreamers, and the  transient and upcoming
      youth of the world a place to build their dreams, and grow roots. If these people
      weren''t in every community  there would be nothing to come home to, no where
      to arrive at. Notice them, when your running  to your next great adventure,
      thank them for doing whatever it is that they do. And do not be afraid to find
      yourself one day, one of them.</p>

      <p>Just because you are one of them does not mean you will not find great satisfaction
      in your work, great love from friends and family, or that you will be bored
      or boring. I''ve been a dispatcher at a fire department for many years, and
      it''s taught me two things.  You cannot ever imagine how quickly your life can
      change, or end.</p>

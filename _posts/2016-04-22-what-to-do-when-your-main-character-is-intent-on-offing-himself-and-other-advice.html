    body: "On November 7th, 2010, while living in Prague, I received a call from my\
      \ dad. His silence confirmed what I already knew, because I'd seen my 15 year\
      \ old cousin's Facebook post that our grandma died after a painstakingly slow\
      \ decent into dementia, coupled with a painstakingly short stint with pneumonia.\
      \ I hadn't lost anyone of this importance to me yet in my life, and it will\
      \ remain a moment that broke me in a way that is unfix-able. The problem with\
      \ her dying on November 7th is that I was one week into National Novel Writing\
      \ month. I was young, without any responsibilities, so the only obviously choice\
      \ was to spend my November attempting to pen 50,000 words in-between classes\
      \ and vacations. I was roughly 11,000 words in to my novel on the night I received\
      \ that call from my dad. My main character was an annoying narrator who was\
      \ stifling my voice. Every page was a challenge. Every word was wrong. Grief\
      \ has a funny way of helping you reevaluate everything you know. On November\
      \ 8th, when I sat down on a bench in Old Town Square with my small notepad from\
      \ Tesco, a supporting character took over. He nudged my annoying narrator out\
      \ of the way and started tell his story. I kept shaking my head as ink just\
      \ flew from my pen making words and stories. I had no idea where they came from.\
      \ WWII? Engineering? Geriatrics? WTF? I thought he was the opposite of me: he\
      \ was old, weathered, and depressed. He didn\u2019t like being alive. With every\
      \ word that I wrote, I realized we were more alike than different. By the middle\
      \ of the month, I realized I had written a 30,000 word manifesto of my grief\
      \ under the guise of Eddie. All the pain and weird angst and hurt and numbness\
      \ became words I wrote on any scrap of paper or receipt I could get my hands\
      \ on.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong-- now I am blissfully happy, in the greatest\
      \ love I have ever seen, and am grateful for every opportunity I am afforded--but\
      \ that night, I started my journey through a very dark forest that took me a\
      \ month to get to the edge of. That's what it's like, right? When you see the\
      \ face of someone you love, but isn't in your life anymore, out of the corner\
      \ of your eye? It's like I can catch glimpses of the sun shining through the\
      \ branches of these pines I'm navigating through, but I won't really ever see\
      \ the sun again. I won't ever feel its deep, deep warmth fully. That moment\
      \ of silence from my father pulled a rug out from under me and I've been slowly\
      \ spinning in slow motion ever since. But through those 50,000 words, I came\
      \ to understand myself through Eddie. I am so grateful that he showed up and\
      \ turned the light on for me, because on that night I started spinning, it was\
      \ very dark.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re in the dark, pick up a pen. You never know\
      \ who is inside of you, ready to illuminate a path out of the forest.\r\n\r\n\
      Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers\
      \ to turn on the light.\r\n -Steven Kloves (screenplay), Harry Potter and the\

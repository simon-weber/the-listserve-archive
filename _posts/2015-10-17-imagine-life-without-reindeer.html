    body: "As a little girl I said to my father that I wanted to help the starving\
      \ children in Ethiopia in Africa\r\nwhen I saw the devastation there on the\
      \ TV.\r\n\r\nNow as a 42 year old woman, my longing to help has made me turn\
      \ my eyes to the children and adolescents of my own indigenous people. During\
      \ my lifetime I have realized that those are the ones my heart yearns to help.\r\
      \n\r\nHave you ever heard about the Sami people? If not, maybe you have heard\
      \ about the Laplanders? I am one of them. I am Sami.\r\n\r\nI was brought up\
      \ in a reindeer herding family in the very north of Sweden where the chances\
      \ for a girl to work with reindeer herding was unheard of in the community.\
      \ I never got the question if I wanted to. That work was meant for boys who\
      \ were stronger, the older people said. The girls were encouraged to study.\
      \ So I left my reindeer herding family and pursued a career as a journalist.\r\
      \n\r\nBut all the time I have longed to come back and give back to my Sami community.\
      \ You see, I never got the chance to choose.\r\n\r\nNow I want to help girls\
      \ (and boys) to choose, to challenge the rules and make it possible for them\
      \ to live the life they want. I want them to see the possibilities they possess.\
      \ There is barely anything which supports the indigenous Sami people in Sweden.\
      \ The Swedish government  has been severly criticized by the international community\
      \ (UN/EU) for not treating the Sami people well.\r\n\r\nSo...I am crying while\
      \ writing you this...\r\n\r\nI am about to take the biggest risk I have ever\
      \ taken in my entire life. All because of how much I wan to help and create\
      \ change in my community, and to leave a legacy which can contribute to changing\
      \ the rules, strengthening identities and empower girls and boys to follow their\
      \ dreams.\r\n\r\nI am starting an international foundation (registered in the\
      \ USA) called Adopt a Reindeer and Save a Life. My vision is to help preserve\
      \ the indigenous Sami culture by protecting native reindeer that are essential\
      \ to the Sami way of life. The way it works is that people can adopt a reindeer\
      \ or a herd and the donations will go back to supporting the indigenous Sami\
      \ community with the focus on children and adolescents.\r\n\r\nI am launching\
      \ this foundation on November 1. I have invested a lot of time and money to\
      \ figure it all out and as the time gets closer, my anxiety level climbs. Not\
      \ many people around me here in Sweden know about this, since I am so scared\
      \ to tell them. I don\xB4t know how they will react. Remember, that I once was\
      \ told that I was not good enough.\r\n\r\nBut I have decided to face the fear\
      \ and do it anyway. So here it comes...\r\n\r\nWould you like to help me?\r\n\
      Is there a willingness and an interest to help me spread this message of hope\
      \ and possibility? To help me help these girls and boys? To help me contribute\

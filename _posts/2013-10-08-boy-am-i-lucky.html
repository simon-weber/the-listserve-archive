    <p>"Make good decisions."  My parents weren''t big on forbidding things.  But
    they made it clear as we got older that being an adult is a series of decisions,
    and all good things come as a result of making the right choices and learning
    from the consequences of the bad choices.  So as we left to go out for the night,

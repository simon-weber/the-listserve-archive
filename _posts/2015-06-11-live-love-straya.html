      \ must have been concerned enough as we moved to Switzerland, the opposite to\
      \ South Africa in pretty much every way.  We didn't stop there though, 5 years\
      \ (and 1 little brother) later we packed up again to move closer to family,\
      \ this time to Australia.  Adelaide, South Australia is where we settled, to\
      \ be with family on dad's side. \r\n \r\nNow Adelaide is a special place. Instead\
      \ of the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon, it's the 2 degrees of Adelaide (no, seriously,\
      \ 2 degrees, I've never broken this rule).  We are home to the highest number\
      \ of serial killers and churches in Australia (coincidence?) and even when visiting\
      \ the city centre, it still feels like a massive country town.  That is to say,\

      \ re-location interstate, away from a girlfriend and life I'd come to seriously\
      \ love. That one year in corporate IT turned out to be the worst year of my\
      \ life, experiencing a break-up for the first time, losing touch with a big\

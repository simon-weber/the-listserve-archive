      <p>I''m a "survivor" now but I still think about it (death) a lot.  Perhaps
      that will change as I get older. Perhaps not.  I''ve spent this past year hurting;
      being in pain is part of treatment, but I also mean hurting someone else who
      cared for me and was there for me when I needed it most. What you''ve done for
      me is irreplaceable and you are an exceptional person with so much to offer.
      I''m not the one but I know they are out there for you. Baroooooo!</p>

      <p>As I''m writing in this coffee shop I overheard someone talking about their
      bone marrow transplant...He had his 26 years ago and was one of the first survivors
      of a non-related donor.  Mine was only 6 months ago. We just chatted for an
      hour. Someone recently plugged the national bone marrow registry on listserve
      and its worth saying again. Bethematch[dot]org will send you a kit..all you
      do is swab your cheek then mail it back. It''s free. Some woman in Charlotte
      did it for me and saved my life.  They use stem cells nowadays so it''s painless
      for the donor (HUGE MISNOMER out there, it''s not like it was 10 years ago)</p>

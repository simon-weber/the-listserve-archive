      \ 25 students and a teacher?! I got C's and D's mostly. Until I discovered the\

      \ It was tempting to stop there, but I noticed that most of my contacts still\
      \ came from Western countries and I didn't hear many voices from poorer parts\

      \ many people think that language-learning won't \"stick\" unless they're bored.\
      \ The opposite is the case. If you're having fun hanging out with foreign friends\
      \ or reading cartoons, that's when you'll learn a lot, because the brain is\

      \ you're tired, just watch \"funniest Spanish ads\" or whatever on Youtube for\
      \ your 10 minutes, sing along to a song or read a newspaper article online.\
      \ If you're more awake, study a course or learn some vocabulary. To increase\
      \ your chances of studying every day, find stuff to do while commuting, cleaning\
      \ or on lunch break, for example listening to podcasts or using a mobile app.\
      \ Variety is the spice of life (and learning). Whenever you managed to do 10\
      \ minutes of study, mark the day in your calendar and don't break the chain!\r\
      \n\r\n3. Use any opportunity to apply what you learned. As soon as you know\
      \ how to say \"Hello. How are you?\", start using those words with restaurant\
      \ staff or other local native speakers. You can also find language exchange\
      \ partners online.\r\n\r\nFor more tips, google \"LearnLangs\" (my blog). There\
      \ are also other polyglot blogs, Youtube channels and forums giving tips on\
      \ how to learn languages. Before you invest in an expensive course, check out\
      \ what kind of high-quality courses are available for free online. I'm creating\
      \ such a website myself right now, it's called LearnYu and will teach Chinese.\
      \ At this point, there are so many resources that you can learn any major language\
      \ for free online.\r\n\r\nI'll leave you with something to think about: \"Languages\

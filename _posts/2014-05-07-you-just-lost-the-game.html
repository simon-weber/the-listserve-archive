      <p>If you don''t know what The Game is, ask a friend who does. Or Urban Dictionary
      it. Point is, you and 24,741 other people just lost it. Please email me with
      other games to play, in the car or otherwise.</p>

      <p>Shout-out to my fellow geologists and MiddKids, my fellow Ridgefielders and
      Madrile&#241;os and Christmas Cove-ers. Shoot me an email, I want to know you.</p>

      <p>In my 20 short years, I have figured out how to keep myself happy. You may
      chuckle at my na&#239;vet&#233;, but these are my thoughts:</p>

      <p>1) Talk to strangers (but use your intuition). If you let yourself have a
      brief conversation, the wall is broken, and friendship becomes infinitely easier.
      If you get nervous, just pretend you''ve turned your brain off and say anything.
      This method works.</p>

      <p>2) Take a moment to be silent and appreciate where you are. I find this often
      takes the form of a "Mountain Appreciation Moment" when driving in the car with
      friends, or pausing to let sunshine soak into my skin.</p>

      <p>3) Don''t let deadlines kill you. Chances are, if you send a polite and nicely-worded
      email to your professor, you can get a little extra time. Professors are people
      too, they don''t want you to burn out. Alternatively, some experiences are simply
      worth a few points off.</p>

      <p>4) Cats and dogs are the solution. Don''t waste your time on an animal that
      lives in a cage and isn''t happy to see you when you come home. Also, don''t
      be so quick to dislike little dogs. They are so uniquely wonderful.</p>

      a break. Surround yourself with some people who make you feel good and have
      a beer every once in a not very long while. Take pictures.</p>

      <p>6) Call your mother. She loves you, even when it seems as though the rest
      of the world doesn''t. My mother''s best quotes: "Everything''s washable." "You''re

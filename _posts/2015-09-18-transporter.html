      <p>It''s difficult to explain a lot of the gender stuff so if you''re truly

      <p>I''ll leave you with some information I found very interesting. There are
      5 metrics I know of to define human sexuality:</p>

      <p>Sex<br />Gender<br />Gender Identity<br />Gender Expression<br />Sexual Orientation</p>

      <p>In my experience it can be pretty damaging to suppress something because
      it''s socially radical or strange. Honesty with yourself is fundamental.</p>

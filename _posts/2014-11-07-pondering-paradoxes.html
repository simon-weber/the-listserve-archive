      \ high school embarks on a service trip every spring, where where year after\
      \ year, we cultivate a deeper, more Christ-like mentality for service. As we\

      \ and her present love for the school to deeply appreciate the introspection\
      \ she underwent to arrive at the best decision she\u2019s made thus far in her\

      \ - reminders I\u2019ll relive every time I walk through this quad and promises\
      \ I\u2019ll need to hold onto tenaciously for future moments of uncertainty\
      \ and struggle.\r\n\r\nFrom formal events such as returning to the same concert\

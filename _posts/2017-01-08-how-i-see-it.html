      I have passed through at least some significant and difficult period of wrestling
      with the question of how to be alive, of what to do with the accident of life,
      and what seems clear to me is that the complexity and conflict we experience

      We&#8217;re just trying to make it from one end of life to the other and to
      love and be loved along the way. But, the limitations of our physical world
      &#8212; that make finite the resources and energy we must all consume, and that

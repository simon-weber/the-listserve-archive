      \ in the last two days.\r\n\r\nA few moments ago, my Twitter feed became a cascade\

      \  He had been pulled over because \u201Che matched the description of a suspect\u201D\
      , reached for his wallet when directed to, informed the officer he had a (legal)\
      \ firearm on him\u2014as you\u2019re supposed to\u2014and was shot in front\
      \ of his girlfriend and her daughter.  The immediate aftermath of the shooting\
      \ was broadcast on Facebook live from inside the car where you can watch the\

      \ more creative ways to \u201Cbreak the ice\u201D when talking to a new person?\
      \ A favorite pastime of mine is collecting and coming up with unique conversation\
      \ starters. I think we can all agree that \u201CWhat do you do for a living?/Do\
      \ you have any pets?/Do you like TV???\u201D is pretty played out, so feel free\
      \ to whip out any of these gems the next time you\u2019re searching for something\
      \ to say (I\u2019m including my answers just for fun):\r\n\r\n-HOW DO YOU FEEL\
      \ ABOUT RANCH DRESSING?\r\nMy answer: I find that people either LOVE (or are\
      \ borderline obsessed with) ranch, despise ranch, or are afraid to admit they\
      \ like ranch, as it is a rather unclassy dressing. Whatever the answer is, I\
      \ guarantee a passionate response and follow-up conversation. I\u2019m a stereotypical,\
      \ middle-class Midwesterner, so ranch and I have a healthy relationship.\r\n\
      \r\n-WOULD YOU RATHER TRAVEL BACK IN TIME, OR BRING SOMEONE FROM A DIFFERENT\
      \ TIME TO NOW?\r\nMy answer: I go back and forth on this one, but I think I\u2019\
      d like to bring someone cool from the past back (like Buster Keaton, Eleanor\
      \ Roosevelt, etc.) so they could be my best friend.\r\n\r\n-WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE\

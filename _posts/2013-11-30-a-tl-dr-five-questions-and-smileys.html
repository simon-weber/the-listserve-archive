<p>I&#8217;m going to split this up into two sections: the first, a &#8220;TL,DR&#8221; for those who don&#8217;t have much time; and the second, a longer, more expanded version of the first.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve only got a couple minutes to spare, here are some questions I want to ask you:</p>
<p>1.      What sort of advice would you give a young adult?</p>
<p>2.      What is your favourite book? (Movie, TV show, etc.)</p>
<p>3.      Where is the best place you&#8217;ve lived or visited? Most interesting adventure?</p>
<p>4.      What is a something I should learn how to do?</p>
<p>5.      If you haven&#8217;t got anything to say to the above, then tell me a story about yourself! Anything at all, don&#8217;t be shy!</p>
<p><br />Hopefully, that was short and sweet enough! I hope you&#8217;ll consider giving me a reply J</p>
<p>Now if you&#8217;ve got a bit more time on your hands, allow me to expand on the above questions.</p>
<p>1.      Nice to meet you! I am from Vancouver but am currently in Toronto as a second-year university student studying engineering, which means that yes, I am a young adult and yes, I am unabashedly looking for tips on life! I&#8217;ve no doubt that there are a wide variety of people reading this, and I wager a fair amount of you all will have lived and experienced more than me. So if you have any sort of advice at all, I&#8217;d love to hear it!</p>
<p>2.      I love reading. Love, love, LOVE it! One of my favourite book series&#8217; is Harry Potter, which you might have heard of &#8230; it really inspired my love of books. I&#8217;m always on the hunt for new ones to read, so if you have a recommendation, please send it my way! Now, I understand that not everyone shares my joy, so if you have a particular movie, TV show, or even song you really enjoy, I&#8217;m definitely willing to expand my horizons.</p>
<p>3.      One of my wishes in life is to travel. Unfortunately, with my limited student budget, it&#8217;s a bit difficult at the moment, but I would love to hear your adventures. Having only visited a paltry number of countries so far (four &#8230; including Canada, where I was born), I would love to hear about some of your experiences, even if it just happened around the corner!</p>
<p>4.      I am always on the lookout to try new things, so I ask you this: has a random skill ever proved useful? Or even something I should learn to do every day that will somehow improve my life? I&#8217;d like to know!</p>
<p>5.      Stories. I like telling them, but I love hearing them more. Share with me any experience that you deem worthy &#8211; it may have been years ago, or it may have just happened yesterday! Whatever it is, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll really enjoy reading about it.</p>
<p><br />That&#8217;s it! Thanks for taking the time out of your day from reading an email from someone you don&#8217;t even know &#8211; it means a lot to me! If this has caught your attention somehow, I&#8217;d love to get a response, and I promise that I&#8217;ll write back, really!</p>
<p>With that, enjoy the rest of your day (or night, as it may be)! J</p>
<p><br />Cheers,</p>

    body: "Hello world:)\r\n\r\nI don't have some special story for you so I just\
      \ share you some thoughts, which help me to live and understand this crazy planet.\r\
      \n\r\n1.     Boys! Don't be afraid to do something crazy for your girls. If\
      \ you do something for woman, you will never look foolish in her eyes.\r\n\r\
      \n2.     If you want make someone think that he is in love with you, do something\
      \ scary together. Adrenaline hormones look like love (science proves it).\r\n\
      \r\n3.     If you want to hug or kiss someone \u2013 do it. I don\u2019t mean\
      \ strangers on the street;)\r\n\r\n4.     Be careful at office parties. Don\u2019\
      t drink a lot.\r\n\r\n5.     If you want to do something, but you are waiting\
      \ for a good moment \u2013 you will wait forever. Every moment is good and bad\
      \ at the same time, start as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n6.     Don\u2019t save\
      \ things for a special case/events/etc. Wear good dress, eat good food. Who\
      \ knows what will happen tomorrow.\r\n\r\n7.     It is easier to get forgiveness\
      \ than permission. Sorry, mommies:)\r\n\r\n8.     Travel as much as you can.\
      \ Even to the next village. Broaden your mind!\r\n\r\n9.     Make plans but\
      \ be ready to change it. Life is unpredictable!\r\n\r\n10. Learn foreign languages.\
      \ Conversation with people from other countries is one of the best things in\
      \ the world.\r\n\r\n11. Save some money every 1-2 month.\r\n\r\n12. Remember\
      \ \u2013 you can\u2019t please everyone. Don\u2019t worry about it, just do\
      \ your best.\r\n\r\n13. If you want to be with someone \u2013 make him feel\
      \ great with you. We all need support and tenderness more than beauty. Unfortunately\
      \ we often understand it too late. But be sure that these efforts make you happy.\r\
      \n\r\n14. At the same time remember \u2013 no one will fall in love with your\
      \ soul from the first sight. Work on your body!\r\n\r\n15. Just think about\
      \ it \u2013 every atom in your body was once a part of star.\r\n\r\n16. But\
      \ the other side \u2013 all water you drink has been already drunk by someoneJ\r\
      \n\r\n17. Trite but true. If you want to do something \u2013 you will look for\
      \ an opportunity, if you just think that you want \u2013 you will look for reasons\
      \ to set it aside.\r\n\r\n18. Sorry for my poor English;)\r\n\r\n19. \u0412\u0441\

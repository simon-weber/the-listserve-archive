      \ would be and for me the most rewarding thing would be to know that I've helped\
      \ somebody. Even if it's just one person it will make it completely worth it.\
      \ This time last year I overcame probably the biggest hurdle and something that\
      \ would have seriously impacted my future. From the age of 15 I suffered with\
      \ panic attacks & anxiety that made even the smallest of things an obstacle.\
      \ For those of you that don't know what panic attacks are, they essentially\
      \ occur due to your brain's inability to process information correctly at that\
      \ particular point in time. They make you feel sick, dizzy and intensely panicky;\
      \ like your whole body is working against you. What makes them worse is that\
      \ they are invisible to anybody but the person having them and often come at\
      \ the worst of times. It is important to remember that they don't necessarily\
      \ come in high pressure situations, some people get them while riding the tube.\r\
      \n\r\nPersonally, they made doing anything out of the ordinary a challenge.\
      \ I didn't know where to seek help and didn't know how to stop feeling the way\
      \ I did. At my worst I wasn't even sure if I would ever find a way to get rid\
      \ of them. Now here's where I hopefully help at least one of you start to get\
      \ over your panic attacks & anxiety. In the Summer of 2012 I experienced a few\
      \ life events that would change my outlook on everything and change my life.\
      \ At the start of the summer I met my favourite band and with that my biggest\
      \ role model. This experience not only taught me that I could push past my anxiety\
      \ and achieve things I never thought I could, but also that I shouldn't let\
      \ my mind stop me from experiencing the most amazing things in life. During\
      \ that summer I volunteered at the London Olympic Games, pushing myself further\
      \ than I had ever done. During that experience I finally overcame my anxiety\
      \ when I realised one thing; life is too short to let my mind stop me from experiencing\
      \ all the amazing things the world has to offer. If you are sitting reading\
      \ this and you are somebody who believes that you'll never be able to overcome\
      \ your anxiety you just need to keep a few things in mind every day. You can\
      \ ALWAYS take time and relax whenever you're in a situation you believe to be\
      \ difficult. You are in complete control of yourself and nobody is going to\
      \ think bad of you for wanting a few minutes of time. Always remember that what\
      \ you experience can be overcome and it's far simpler than you think, it just\
      \ takes a change in your perception of things. Remember that worry is a complete\
      \ waste of energy, it doesn't produce anything. Finally, don't ever let your\
      \ mind stop you from having a good time. Realise that life is short and you\
      \ should take every opportunity as it's these experiences that you will always\
      \ look back on. I'm 21 next Saturday, in my third year of my degree, have seen\
      \ the most incredible things and have some amazing opportunities ahead of me.\

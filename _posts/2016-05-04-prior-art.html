      <p>The night that I signed the papers, I went for a walk down Mt. Auburn street.
      I played BellX1&#8217;s ''Built to Last'' on repeat. Around me, trees reached
      their bare branches into the darkness, their last leaves descending among footfalls
      on cobblestone streets, where students wrapped in coats and fuzzy boots dissolved
      into the soft shadow and warm glow of street lights, sounds of laughter in Cambridge
      on a late fall evening.</p>

      <p>It was the first real employment contract I&#8217;d signed, as a 22-year-old
      coming straight out of college into a tech startup. The CEO and I were the last
      ones in the office, sunset giving way to darkness outside as I read through
      pages of non-compete and non-disclose and salary contract. They asked for prior
      art. "What have you done?,&#8221; said the voice in my head, &#8220;what have
      you done that gives you the right to be here?" It was a voice that I&#8217;d
      get to know intimately well over the next few years. I drew a picture of a time
      machine, because you never know.</p>

      <p>Alongside the other papers was a shareholder agreement granting me a tiny
      portion of the company. &#8220;Right now it''s worth a few cents,&#8221; the
      CEO told me, &#8220;but it could eventually amount to something.&#8221; I signed
      it.</p>

      <p>What followed were weeks, months, years of hard work. We think of technology

      human. What you make as a company is a reflection of who you are and who you
      are growing into, and all of these things come from people and the way they

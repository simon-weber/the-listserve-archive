<p>Hi All, I've been thinking about changing careers for the past 10 years.  I turn 43 next week and I&#8217;d like to go back to school, get an engineering degree, and enter the rehabilitation engineering profession.  I want put my energy into something that will make a concrete difference in the lives of others.  I&#8217;d like to use my talents to help others achieve more than they thought possible in their own lives.</p>
<p>Fear and my perception of the challenges seem so monumental that they've frozen any real progress for literally years.  I'm afraid of failing.  I&#8217;m afraid of succeeding and it not being what I imagined it would be.  How am I going to pay for school?  Is it smart to take out loans?  It is the right thing to do to leave a profession that I've been successful in for the last 20 years to follow a dream.  Is that the responsible thing to do?  Am I being selfish?</p>
<p>The truth is that I don&#8217;t know and I&#8217;m not actually sure what I&#8217;m going to do.  I&#8217;m not sharing this to tell you that I have all the answers and tell you how to live your life.  I&#8217;m not sharing this to ask for help in figuring out my life.  I&#8217;m sharing this because I believe the desire to do more with your life, to make an impact beyond yourself, is part of the human condition shared by all of us.</p>
<p>I share this to let you know that you are not alone.</p>
<p>Just as I've read the stories of others who are much older than me changing their lives, many with many more challenges then I face, allow me to at least see the possible where I fear it may be impossible, maybe you would read this and see some hope in achieving your own dreams.</p>
<p>Maybe together we can figure this out.</p>
<p>I've always loved the poem, "If" by Rudyard Kipling and I've thought about the words often as I've gone through my life.  I especially like the lines:</p>
<p>If you can fill the unforgiving minute With sixty seconds' worth of distance run, Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it, And---which is more---you'll be a Man, my son!</p>
<p>I don't know what tomorrow will bring but tonight I feel like running ... 60 seconds on the clock ... who's with me.</p>
<p><br />Warmest Regards,</p>

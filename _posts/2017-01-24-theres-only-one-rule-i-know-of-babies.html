      t remember when I joined the Listserve, but I think pretty soon after, I had\
      \ a good idea of what I\u2019d write if I ever won.  Then I waited.  Well, that\u2019\
      s not true.  I didn\u2019t wait, I moved on, and life moved on.  Jobs changed\
      \ (bittersweet, but ultimately for the better), major life events happened (both\
      \ happy and sad), a kid happened (freaking awesome!), and much glory was had\
      \ (Google \u2018Kinetic Grand Championship\u2019).  And then, a couple years\
      \ later, I won!  And suddenly, what I wanted to write felt trite and idealistic,\
      \ and yet, at the same time, even more relevant than ever.\r\n\r\nWhat I wanted\
      \ to write, those years ago, was this \u2013 the idea of a \u2018Pay-it-Forward\
      \ Birthday\u2019.  We all have birthdays.  We also all have networks, of friends,\
      \ family (both by birth and by association), of community, and colleagues. \
      \ I wanted to challenge you all to a Pay-It-Forward Birthday, where you reach\
      \ out to your network and request that for your birthday, everyone gives you\
      \ a present.  In lieu of any material presents, however, everyone (yourself\
      \ included) does something nice for a fellow human being or for the planet.\
      \  It doesn\u2019t have to be much, not much of anything at all.  It\u2019s\
      \ not about the size of the gesture, it is about the intent.  Since this is\
      \ a gift people are giving you, it\u2019s about doing something that they wouldn\u2019\
      t normally do, about intentionally going out of their way to do something positive\
      \ in the world, ostensibly in your name.  Some ideas I had come up with to get\
      \ people started:\r\n\r\n-\tGive change to someone that needs it\r\n-\tSmile\
      \ at someone on the street\r\n-\tBe polite and civil in a mundane day-to-day\
      \ interaction\r\n-\tPick up some trash by the side of the road or on the trail\r\
      \n-\tMake a more planet friendly decision in your food or transportation choices\r\
      \n-\tPlant a tree (native of course)\r\n-\tSupport a local non-profit or public\
      \ radio station\r\n\r\nThis challenge comes with NO financial obligation, it\u2019\
      s all about simple little gestures that make the world a better place.  I tried\
      \ this for my 30th birthday.  The highlights included Christmas presents being\
      \ donated to kids in need (my birthday is in December), trees being planted,\
      \ and garbage was collected on local trails.  In the years since, I\u2019ve\
      \ thrown birthday parties where the entry fee was a non-perishable food item,\
      \ which was then donated to a local food bank.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the rub, I\u2019\
      m 35 now.  This seems somewhat na\xEFve and ridiculous, and simultaneously,\
      \ the world seems a darker place, in need of all the help it can get.  In the\
      \ in-between years, I\u2019ve also become more aware of my own privilege.  Not\
      \ everyone has a network that has the capacity to give.  And I realized that\
      \ it doesn\u2019t always cut it to ask others to do the work that I feel is\
      \ needed.  I feel more motivated to take it on myself to make the changes I\
      \ want to see in the world, rather than exhorting others to do so.\r\n\r\nSo\
      \ \u2013 I\u2019ll leave you with this.  If you like this idea, I encourage\
      \ you to try it, especially if it\u2019s small-scale and hyperlocal.  If you\
      \ think this is ridiculous idealism and optimism, that\u2019s fine too.  In\
      \ the meantime, I\u2019m going to roll my sleeves up, get more involved in my\
      \ community, and teach my kid to be a better version of myself.\r\n\r\nKeep\
      \ it rooted, hands in the dirt, face in the sun,\r\n\r\nDave\r\nHumboldt County,\

    body: "Myanmar, 2011: A friend gave me some leftovers since she was going out\
      \ to dinner and then travelling and didn't want the food to get wasted.  She\
      \ left me a note on a postcard of a beautiful little girl.  I kept that postcard\
      \ on my desk - and looked into that little girl's eyes very often.\r\n\r\nLaos,\
      \ April 2012: I was doing a month-long assignment and missing my husband.  I\
      \ had written him a note about how I felt so lost and could not understand what\
      \ I was doing with my life, far away from him.  I was also sad and frustrated\
      \ that I couldn't get pregnant.\r\nHe sent me an email that I've kept to this\
      \ day - an email with his vision for our lives.  He mentions in there coming\
      \ home after a long dinner, to our little girl who wraps her arms around our\
      \ necks and begs for a bedtime story.  I take a warm shower and then join them\
      \ in her bed for the story.  It sounds like a dream.\r\n\r\nJerusalem, September\
      \ 2012: I was walking around with a colleague on a Sunday evening in East Jerusalem\
      \ looking for a cosy restaurant.  On our way we found a single black patent\
      \ leather girl's shoe.  I picked it up and decided to bring it back home with\
      \ me.  \"Perhaps it will prove a good sign\", I said to my colleague.  She nodded\
      \ warmly.  When I told my friend in New York about the shoe, she told me that\
      \ she'd also been out for a walk and had also seen a single black patent little\
      \ girl's shoe.  Serendipity?\r\n\r\nHong Kong, January 2015: My little girl\
      \ was born.  When I look at her now I don't know why I doubted that she would\
      \ ever come to me - it's as if it was meant to be.  I can\u2019t imagine myself\
      \ with any other child but her.  But I didn't always feel this way.  People\
      \ often said \"Just relax, you'll get pregnant\" and I always thought \"Yes,\
      \ but what if I don't?\".\r\n\r\nWe considered adoption and went to information\
      \ sessions and talked it over.  We also did some fertility treatments - which\
      \ made us feel so detached from one another and from the process of creating\
      \ a little human.  I got pregnant outside of these fertility treatments.  It\
      \ came from out of the blue \u2013 like a miracle after 5+ years of no success.\r\
      \n\r\nMy little darling is almost 2.5 years old now.  She is everything.  My\
      \ life could have been very different if it weren't for a stroke of something.\
      \  Perhaps the post card, the warm email and the little shoes were signs to\
      \ me that she was on her way.  I really feel for women who are having difficulties\
      \ getting pregnant.  I know the frustration and the pain and the well-meaning\
      \ comments of \"Just relax - it will happen\".\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t have any\
      \ words of wisdom to offer, just my story.  If any of this resonates with you,\

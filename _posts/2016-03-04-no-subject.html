      \ before technology, and the half after.\r\nA few weeks back, I was waiting\
      \ at a corner for a bus. I noticed what felt to me like a temporary sign affixed\
      \ to the bus stop pole. I pulled out my iPhone. I use Voiceover on my phone,\
      \ a built-in feature that speaks what\u2019s on the screen and lets me manipulate\
      \ it with different gestures.\r\nI open up an app, I choose the video mode.\
      \ The app searches for text and reads it. \u201CThis stop closed, use north\
      \ corner.\u201D\r\nTechnology has opened up the world for me. I read the papers,\
      \ I do my shopping and banking and a myriad of other things online; on my phone\
      \ I have a barcode reader, a color identifier, a light detector, and text recognition\
      \ apps. There\u2019s an app that will connect me with a sighted volunteer for\
      \ those times when I just need someone who can see something for me. Most of\
      \ all, it\u2019s opened up the world of books, in ways that just weren\u2019\
      t possible 20 years ago.\r\nIt\u2019s happening like this for disabled people\
      \ all over the world. People are taking hold of technology, and figuring out\
      \ how to use it to do things. It\u2019s the great disability hack, and it\u2019\
      s amazing.\r\nIt\u2019s also incredibly fragile. Regularly I visit websites\
      \ where the designer has introduced features that don\u2019t work with the screen\

      \ jobs as the best candidate, only to find that the software required to do\
      \ that job isn\u2019t compatible with screen readers. Accessibility wasn\u2019\
      t considered when that company made its software purchases, and so, a portion\
      \ of the population was locked out from those jobs.\r\nI just toured a beautiful\
      \ new building with a great, trendy rooftop space. I noticed that there was\
      \ a lip in the doorsill going out to the roof. Could a wheelchair get over that\

      \ shut us out.\r\nIf it\u2019s going to be the first way, and not the second,\
      \ it requires that we create a culture where accessibility is the norm.\r\n\
      If you don\u2019t know about them, google the principles of universal design.\
      \ To me, they read like a soaring manifesto for diversity \u2013 designing a\

      \nI was so psyched to win the listserve lottery. I love reading people\u2019\
      s stories and hearing what folks are passionate about.\r\nI figure this is my\
      \ chance to speak up for accessibility.\r\nIf you\u2019re a web designer, follow\
      \ the accessibility guidelines \u2013 make sure, among other things that you\
      \ can interact with the site using just a keyboard. If you\u2019re an app designer,\
      \ make sure all graphics are labeled, and do an accessibility check.\r\nIf you\u2019\

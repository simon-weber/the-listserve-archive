      <p><br />The Legal Status of RE</p>

      <p>All schools in the UK must legally provide Religious Education (RE) to its
      students, this dates back to a time when a huge number of schools providing
      free education were Church schools. At various times it has been known as Religious
      Studies or Religious Instruction. In the past it was entirely Christian in nature
      and taught as fact. Nowadays it must be predominantly Christian and also reflect
      other beliefs prevalent in the local area. For this reason there is no National
      Curriculum, instead in each Local Authority (LA) area a council (SACRE) is formed
      of local teachers and leaders of local religious organisations as well as representatives
      of the Church of England to decide what students in their area should study
      between ages 4-14 (whilst they could advise up to 18 in my experience they instead
      advocate taking an approved exam course at this stage). SACREs can include Humanist
      representatives and many (all?) SACREs recommend teaching about atheism and
      reasons for non-belief as well as taking a critical approach to religion as
      the students mature. Since under this government many schools have become academies
      and are therefore freed from their LA they are freed of following SACRE guidance,
      but they would have to justify major changes to the syllabus. Faith schools
      are free to only teach about their religion.</p>

      <p>Government guidance says the purpose of RE is ''spiritual, moral, social
      and cultural development''  ''personal development and well-being'' and ''community
      cohesion'' - no small task!</p>

      <p><br />The Problems RE Faces</p>

      <p>- In (non-faith) schools it is often the lowest priority. Primary school
      teaching is often poor, with the teachers reluctant to tackle a subject they
      feel they know little about and that has the potential to offend. In Secondary
      schools it is often given to non-specialist teachers. PSHE and Citizenship are
      shoe-horned into it, and GCSE courses are expected to be delivered in half the
      time given to other subjects.</p>

      <p>- There is no academic subject called RE. An Ofsted report last year said
      RE was confused about what it was trying to achieve. The curriculum is decided
      by, and the subject is taught by, a mixture of theists, atheists, theologians,
      priests, philosophers and sociologists. If we could decide what the subject
      is we could decide how to teach and assess it (or even if it can/should be assessed).</p>

      <p>- There is little public understanding of the need for the subject. Public
      perception is often that it has not moved on from the days of RS/RI. There are
      particularly low results for the white working classes - the group least likely
      to be religiously affiliated.</p>

      <p>- Education Secretaries do little to help the image of modern RE by sending
      editions of the KJV to every school (Gove) or by being a vocally conservative
      Christian (Morgan).</p>

      <p>- The leeway given to faith schools (including redacting exam papers) undermines
      the work done in other schools.</p>

      <p>I am out of words to mention more issues, let alone attempt solutions. I
      hope this was informative and feel free to e-mail if you''d like to talk about
      any of it further.</p>

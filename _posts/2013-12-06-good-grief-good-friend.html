      <p>Despite the fact that 100% of people die, our culture ignores death or grief.
      When my father died suddenly at 59, I had no fucking clue how to be in this
      new world *without* him and *with* grief. At first there were lots of people,
      cards, flowers. Then everyone went back to their lives&#8230; and utter loneliness
      set in. I felt deserted, but now I understand that I wasn&#8217;t the only one
      who didn&#8217;t know what to do.</p>

      <p>So here&#8217;s some &#8220;What to Do&#8217;s&#8221; post-funeral to about
      a year later, the darkest time, next you find your friend in grief:</p>

      <p>----- Listen -----<br />You can&#8217;t fill my void with words. Don&#8217;t
      tell me he&#8217;s in a better place, god has a plan, or any other clich&#233;
      that sounds appropriate but really minimalizes my current, very real experience.
      He died. And no, this is not like the time your great-aunt died when you were
      three. Even the true stuff like &#8216;time heals&#8217; doesn&#8217;t feel
      good to hear yet. You can simply say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to say&#8221;
      and just be there. We can sit in silence. Or I probably have lots to say as
      I work through this: all kinds of sad, weird, dark, crazy, angry, contradictory,
      random stuff. Just be there, listen to me.</p>

      <p>----- Reach out -----<br />Don&#8217;t wait for me to reach out to you. Call
      me, when I&#8217;m lying in the depths of devastation and meaninglessness, it&#8217;s
      easier to answer the phone than to find one, figure out who to dial, actually
      do it, and hope they will answer. Randomly stop by, and bring a funny movie
      (and food!). Be prepared to walk away without hurt feelings if I just want to
      be alone (leave the food). Likely I&#8217;ll need the company and the relief.
      Just the fact you checked in on me makes me a tiny bit less alone.</p>

      <p>But you have to reach out a lot, and let me say no. Don&#8217;t expect me
      to be ready to share my pain with you when you&#8217;re ready to be available
      to me. I might finally be feeling good for a few precious moments, don&#8217;t
      force me into a conversation about &#8220;how I&#8217;m doing with all &#8216;that&#8217;&#8221;
      just because you have an extra ten today and want to feel like a good friend.</p>

      <p>----- Give -----<br />Do the little things for me. I need practical help.
      Whether I am accepting it or not, my life goes on and I need to eat, fulfill
      some responsibilities, and take care of myself. The grocery store is unbelievably
      overwhelming. Why are there seven different kinds of EVERYTHING and which to
      choose? I can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s meaningless. Everything is meaningless. Why
      eat? Deliver me lunches, go grocery shopping for me, come fix me dinner, help
      me clean my space, take me on walks. I won&#8217;t think ask you for these things,
      but I need them.</p>

      <p>--------------------<br />It takes time. There&#8217;s no correct process
      or timescale. For me, years have passed and I&#8217;m happy and joyful again.
      I&#8217;m forever grateful to the few really good friends who didn&#8217;t disappear
      once the funeral ended. For the rest of my life I&#8217;ll miss my dad; what
      I like best now is reminiscing with family and old friends about him. The stories
      help him not feel so permanently far away. But he is, he died, and there&#8217;s
      no use ignoring death or minimalizing grief. Talk about it, be there, listen,
      reach out, give - don&#8217;t disappear. Love.</p>

<p>I want to write about the funniest conversation I have participated in to date.</p>
<p>My sister entertains when she doesn&#8217;t even mean to. With aspergers syndrome, she is always literal, serious, and takes things exactly as you say them. My sarcastic family doesn&#8217;t make life easy for her and yes, I might get a little carried away from time to time, but she has no idea how her unintentional humor lights up our lives.</p>
<p>She had just gotten back from her favorite yearly activity &#8211; StarFest, where self-proclaimed dorks and geeks gather in a convention style hotel while wearing their favorite fantasy-inspired costume and participate in well, I went once for moral support and I couldn&#8217;t really tell you. I&#8217;ll relive that if I get this Listserve opportunity again.</p>
<p>She was pooped. And cranky. Her whole life she has worn exhaustion on her sleeve like a sweater and her bitchiness was apparent right off the bat that afternoon. (Disclaimer &#8211; Mitch, name changed, is her now fianc&#233;)</p>
<p>Mom &#8211; &#8220;Honey did you not get a lot of sleep last night?&#8221;<br />Sister &#8211; (loud sigh) &#8220;PSH uh, NO&#8221;<br />Mom &#8211; &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry why is that?&#8221;<br />Sister &#8211; &#8220;WELL&#8230; the guy lying next to Mitch was snoring SO LOUD we couldn&#8217;t sleep&#8221;<br />Me &#8211; &#8220;Um, there was a guy next to Mitch?&#8221;<br />Sister &#8211; &#8220;Yeah. And I elbowed Mitch and was like MITCH. GET HIM TO SHUT UP&#8221;<br />Me &#8211; &#8220;So, it&#8217;s you, Mitch and this guy?&#8221;<br />Sister &#8211; &#8220;Yeah. So Mitch grabs his light saber and starts to poke him, and FINALLY he shut up but it took awhile so I&#8217;m really tired&#8221;<br />Me &#8211; straight face - &#8220;What exactly do you mean by &#8216;light saber&#8217;&#8221;<br />Sister &#8211; annoyed - &#8220;You have to know what a light saber is&#8230;&#8221;<br />Mom &#8211; stopping the train wreck -  &#8220;MINDY. Enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a rocking chair a few feet away, my dad&#8217;s shoulders are shrugging with laughter while he listens in. The next few minutes involved tales of infuriating Star Trek assholes and uninvited furries; long lines for autographs and admissions of needing to &#8220;clean the con-funk&#8221; off. (Con-funk is the result of several days of not showering while in close quarters with other costume loving individuals &#8211; if you didn&#8217;t know that already) What can I say &#8211; it was just hilarious. So many conversations I have had with my sister in my life have gone that way.</p>
<p>The color she brings with her weirdness is fantastic. I wish all of you at some point have an individual in your lives that brings &#8220;different&#8221; into your reality, whatever side of the spectrum you are on. I am very lucky to have it- and I&#8217;m fairly confident my sister thinks I am ridiculous. Sometimes I think that to her, I am the &#8220;different&#8221;!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and go Broncos.</p>

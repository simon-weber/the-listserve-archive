      <p>My sister entertains when she doesn&#8217;t even mean to. With aspergers

      them. My sarcastic family doesn&#8217;t make life easy for her and yes, I might
      get a little carried away from time to time, but she has no idea how her unintentional

      <p>Mom &#8211; &#8220;Honey did you not get a lot of sleep last night?&#8221;<br

      &#8220;Um, there was a guy next to Mitch?&#8221;<br />Sister &#8211; &#8220;Yeah.
      And I elbowed Mitch and was like MITCH. GET HIM TO SHUT UP&#8221;<br />Me &#8211;
      &#8220;So, it&#8217;s you, Mitch and this guy?&#8221;<br />Sister &#8211; &#8220;Yeah.
      So Mitch grabs his light saber and starts to poke him, and FINALLY he shut up
      but it took awhile so I&#8217;m really tired&#8221;<br />Me &#8211; straight

    the author</p>

    <p>I. Librarians<br />As far as I know, I am the second librarian-type person
    in Champaign, Illinois (the other was Nanette D., a librarian at the Champaign
    Public Library) to win the Listserve lottery. My friend who turned me on to the
    Listserve, Ellen K., is also a librarian-type person who has won the Listserve
    lottery, but she is no longer in Champaign.</p>

    <p>I have worked in libraries, have a master''s degree in library &amp; information
    science, and am currently/desperately trying to finish my PhD in that field. I
    like to think of myself as a rogue librarian - I seek out or tend to attract confused-looking
    people on the street, in grocery stores, and, of course, the library stacks. And
    I love to help because that is what I see as the essential function of a librarian:
    helping people find what they need.</p>

    <p>II. JFK, Bill Hicks, and history<br />November 22, 2013 is the fiftieth anniversary
    of the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, 35th President of the United
    States. In the US and A this is a Very Big Deal. When I think of the JFK assassination,
    my first association is with the American comedian Bill Hicks (1961-1994), who

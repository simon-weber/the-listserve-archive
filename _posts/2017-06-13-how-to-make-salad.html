      I''m interested in all types of food. But salad is food in its finest, purest,
      and freshest form. Salad is endless combinations of edible sunlight. It is kinder,
      gentler food for human bodies and the planet. Salad is beautiful. It''s food

      <p>Last fall I embarked on a creative endeavor to share my love of salad with

      <p>Why should you make salad? Don''t make salad because you''re striving for

<p>Hello everyone,<br />It's an honor to be writing to all of you. I can't believe I've been picked so early on!<br />I've been trying to figure out what to write about, and believe me&#8230; it's tough. Don't worry, I'll be brief.</p>
<p>I have something I'd like you to do.</p>
<p>Think about a project you've been wanting to finish &#8212; perhaps something important, or perhaps something small. And ask yourself&#8230; why haven't you done it yet?</p>
<p>Today, I want you to put aside whatever's standing in your way. Finish that project. Even if it's not perfect, there's always time to fix things later.</p>
<p>The biggest barrier to success is often fear of failure. But that's okay&#8230; it's better to try often and fail, than to wait for perfection which will never come.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

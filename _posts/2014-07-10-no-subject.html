      \ when the World Cup is happening in my country, Brazil.\r\nIt\u2019s been an\
      \ amazing event, not only because of the great games but especially because\
      \ of the feeling. Everybody is happy, the 200 million Brazilians and the thousands\
      \ and thousands tourists that came from everywhere in the planet.\r\nOur visitors\
      \ are in love with Brazil. A French journalist wrote that he was shocked for\
      \ visiting a place where everybody is kind and nice. An American journalist\
      \ wrote that the feeling of this World Cup should be bottled and exported to\
      \ Russia and Qatar, hosts of the next ones in 2018 and 2022.\r\nEverybody says\
      \ this is the best World Cup ever, all games are a fantastic party that goes\
      \ on to the streets of the 12 cities that hosted games. I wanted it would happen\
      \ again here next year, some say all of them should be here.\r\nBrazilians always\
      \ suffered from an inferiority complex. We used to think that our nation was\
      \ not good enough for first world visitors: our tarmac with some pot holes,\
      \ our chaotic traffic in the big cities, high prices, slums in some places.\
      \ But now we find out that tourists don\u2019t want the same things they have\
      \ at home.\r\nThey want new experiences, and Brazil can offer a lot of that.\
      \ Our culture is very rich, our nature is fantastic \u2013 from the beaches\
      \ to the Amazon -, our people are multiracial and always ready to help a tourist.\r\
      \nWe have problems, of course, but working hard to solve them. In the last 10\
      \ years 37 million people left a situation of poverty and entered the middle\
      \ class. No other nation achieved that so fast, and it\u2019s a real revolution.\r\
      \nAfter the wonderful World Cup we can say, with no inferiority complex: come\
      \ visit Brazil, you will love it. You can plan right now coming for the Olymnpic\
      \ Games in Rio de Janeiro, 2016.\r\nWant a taste of Brazil? I will give you\
      \ a recipe of caipirinha, our national drink that was approved by 10 out of\
      \ 10 tourists that came for the World Cup. This is a simple one (there are other\
      \ recipes, more sophisticated), but it works well:\r\nSqueeze a lime in a medium\
      \ glass. Add 2 teaspoons of sugar and 80 cc of cacha\xE7a (a Brazilian sugar\
      \ cane distilled). Stir it well, add lots of ice, stir again and enjoy. You\
      \ can use more sugar, more cacha\xE7a, it\u2019s up to you.\r\nDon\u2019t have\
      \ cacha\xE7a? No problem. Use rum, and call it a caipir\xEDssima. Or use vodka,\
      \ and call it a caipiroska. You will love it anyway.\r\nSorry about my lousy\
      \ English, but if I used Portuguese nobody would understand me.\r\nWanna reply,\
      \ wanna know more about Brazil? Feel free to write me to this e mail: luizafonsofranz@gmail.com.\r\
      \nEnjoy your life.\r\n\r\n\r\nLuiz Afonso Franz\r\nluizafonsofranz@gmail.com\r\

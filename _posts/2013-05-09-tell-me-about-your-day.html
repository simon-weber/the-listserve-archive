      \n\r\nI want you to call me at this number: +1 (971) 200-5065\r\n\r\nI want\
      \ you to tell me all about your day. What did you see on your way to the train?\
      \ Who did you talk to? What was scary? What was fun? What made it special? What\
      \ made it bleak? Who pissed you off at work? What kind of smoothie did you choose?\
      \ What did the asshole ahead of you at Starbucks order? How beautiful did she\
      \ look in that sweater? Think of this as a time to reflect on the things that\
      \ are happening both around, and inside of you - your own, free, thirty-second\
      \ therapy session.  You can rant, rave, bitch, moan, whistle, sing, cry, whatever.\
      \ It's about you. Hopefully through your reflection, and my exposure to your\
      \ stories, you and I can both become a little more enlightened about this whole\
      \ \"life\" thing.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of continuity, it would be really great\
      \ if everyone started their message with the words \"Hi Tim.\" I'm hoping to\
      \ use these recordings for a project in the future. I'll tell you more about\
      \ it the next time I win the Listserve. Right now, I just need your help by\
      \ calling in, and telling me about your day. You can be anonymous, or you can\
      \ leave your name and where you're calling from. It's all up to you.\r\n\r\n\
      This project was inspired, in part, by the work that Olga Nunes did through\
      \ the Listserve. Thanks for the inspiration, Olga!\r\n\r\nThanks also to Alon\
      \ who introduced me to the Listserve. I hope you get a kick out of seeing your\
      \ name here, and I look forward to hearing about your day. Though we have been\
      \ separated by the distance of many years, I will always consider you one of\
      \ my truest friends. Duffy wolf for life, bro.\r\n\r\nIf you want to know more\
      \ about me, what happens with this project, or just feel like grabbing a beer,\
      \ reach out. In the meantime, just know that I love you, and thank you for sharing\
      \ your day with me.\r\n\r\n\r\nTim Kretchmer\r\nPortland, OR, USA\r\ntimlistserve@gmail.com\r\

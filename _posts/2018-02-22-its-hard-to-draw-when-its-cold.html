      <p>My name is Paulina and I live in a crappy and cold city of Warsaw, Poland.
      I''m a 25 year old graphic designer and animator and I''m one of the creators
      of a very cool family "theatre-like" TV series. I work for a public institution
      - a national TV station, and let me tell you - it has been a bumpy ride.  I
      never really planned what I would write in case I won. So I will share some
      of my hopes and dreams for the future:</p>

      <p>- Finally getting my master''s degree finished (so overdue) <br />- Getting
      all the episodes of the series done (kind of stressful)<br />- Travelling the
      world and scuba diving (a great passion of mine)<br />- Getting a new job<br
      />- Moving somewhere warm<br />- Being happy</p>

      <p>I am at a crossroads right now. I''m finishing the last few episodes of the
      series and I would like to find something new and challenging to get into.</p>

      <p>I always want to meet new people - for opportunities or just to chat. I would
      love to hear how you''re doing today.</p>

      <p>Write me if you want to learn more about my job and series. Write if you

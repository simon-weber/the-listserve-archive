<p>Hi, people of the world,</p>
<p>Like most of you, I guess, I've been reading stories since I was a<br />child, and I stlil do. I also write stories. True stories: I'm a<br />journalist.</p>
<p>One of my obsession and great wonder, especially when there is so much<br />to read/watch/etc., is: What makes us read a story till the end?</p>
<p>I would love to hear your thoughts on this. You can<br />&#8226;&#8226; send me a link toward stories you loved (text, film, multimedia, whatever),<br />&#8226;&#8226; share your thoughts on this topic,<br />&#8226;&#8226; do both.<br />+ You can share your craziest thoughts on new ways of telling stories,<br />ways that you'd love to experience, but haven't so far.</p>
<p>I'm excited to read what you have to say!</p>

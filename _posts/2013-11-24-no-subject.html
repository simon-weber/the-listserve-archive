    body: "I have always had fear in life and I could never figure out why. Maybe\
      \ its a personality issue. I have always admired fearless people who take the\
      \ risk and bet everything on what they believe. There were times that I just\
      \ wanted to have the guts to quit and follow my heart, but my Capricorn Moon\
      \ never let me. My decision making process is more rational than emotional and\
      \ that's something I need to learn how to balance.\r\n\r\nI have always loved\
      \ art. Art is my passion, is my home, is where I go to when I am down or up.\
      \ Art never let me fall. I have released a book; produced one Theatre play USA\
      \ and another in Brazil; I have had three painting exhibitions; I wrote a bossa\
      \ nova song; I had an Art Channel at Youtube called Arte por Ai and a blog called\
      \ The Art Reference (I know - I dont have focus!). But all of those projects\
      \ were done in my spare time, as a second option, as a hobby. I actually work\
      \ as contract auditor for an oil and gas company. I know, right? Crazy me.\r\
      \n\r\nHowever this year gave me a tremendous crisis. As for the Chinese characters,\
      \ the word crisis means danger and opportunity. I began the year with a broken\
      \ heart and destroyed dreams which were followed by family issues and now I\
      \ am about to get fired. I have found myself in the last months duelling with\
      \ those issues. But I have then made a promise to myself that whenever I find\
      \ myself in a difficult moment in my life I would never NEVER make a down turn\
      \ to a negative habbit like drugs, alcohol, smoke or depression. But I would\
      \ turn to good things...even if I were at extreme... So I found my lovely shrink,\
      \ meditation, yoga, sport and art again. \r\n\r\nThis is stupid, but I also\
      \ adopted the Jim Carrey's \"Yes Man\" movie concept for a month. In the movie,\
      \ Jim says yes to every single invitation made to him and this ends up opening\
      \ him to a new world. I did that for a month and I did amazing things and met\
      \ amazing people. Stand up paddle; crazy trails; karaoke (believe me, I sing\
      \ really bad); travels; cooking; political protests; slack line; organise a\
      \ live music picnic;  \r\n \r\nAnd now I find myself in this moment: THE moment.\
      \ F**k!\r\nIts just like that expression \"the train never passes twice\". If\
      \ I dont catch it now the chance is gone. I am happy and also shitting my pants.\
      \ \r\n\r\nI just needed to believe everything will be ok! And yesterday I was\
      \ alone at the metro and, out of the blue, an old sir came to me and said: \"\
      I've got to tell you something. I am sorry to disturb. Listen to others but\
      \ also tell your truth. Release that energy inside you. Ok?\" To which I answered:\
      \ \"Yes\" and he vanished.  I only needed someone to say it will be ok and that\
      \ I am not alone!\r\n\r\nI can say that I will tr... that I will make it happen\
      \ no matter what!\r\nThats a promise to me and a promise to you all, my Listserve\
      \ friends!\r\n\r\nSo, feel free to follow my career and cheer, because I ought\
      \ to find the necessary courage to make it rock!\r\n\r\nCheers from Brazil.\r\
      \nHave an amazing end of the year and may 2014 come with an exciting World Cup\
      \ in Brazil! \r\n\r\n\r\nMarcela Lanna\r\nRio de Janeiro, Brazil\r\nFacebook\

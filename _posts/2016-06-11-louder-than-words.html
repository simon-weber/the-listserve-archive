      <p>&#8220;Sure dad.&#8221;</p>

      <p>During his last remaining months alive, my father had developed an affinity
      for some odd combinations of food.</p>

      <p>Most of his meals were now being taken in bed and he was looking frail but
      not hopeless. Since he was diagnosed with the cancer a year or so prior, he
      had maintained that the Lord would heal him.</p>

      <p>***</p>

      <p>My father was a very honorable man. Classy is the word that comes to mind.
      He drove bus for half of my growing up years, and I knew he had to deal with
      a lot of difficult people. Yet he never really complained. This was typical
      of his generation.</p>

      <p>Some of my favorite memories of him included playing golf together, throwing
      the baseball around and seeing him wake up early to read his devotions before
      heading off to work.</p>

      <p>Sometimes I think God is most pleased with the folks who humbly make their
      way in the world with an unworldly peace in their heart trusting He&#8217;s
      going to take care of them. This was my father.</p>

      <p>***</p>

      <p>My mother, older brother and his wife were his constant companions while
      I drove back and forth from college when I could &#8211; mostly on weekends.
      We would talk, read scripture together and sometimes, sing.</p>

      <p>Almost 20 years ago, on the morning of April 5th, he told my mom that Jesus
      was going to take him home that day.</p>

      <p>And, around 7 in the evening, my dad&#8217;s cancer was healed.</p>

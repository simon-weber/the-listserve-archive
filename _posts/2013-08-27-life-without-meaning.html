    <p>When I was younger I had aspirations to do two things: to become a biologist
    and to write music.  Those pursuits were intended to give a backbone to my life.  To
    expand the boundaries of human knowledge and to create a permanent record of my
    thoughts passed down through the ages.</p>

    <p>As I got older those things became less satisfying.  The realities of life
    as a biologist turned me off from pursuing it as a career.  As for music, the
    idea that it is in any way permanent began to feel absurd.  Technology and ephemeral
    taste and the vast expanse of existing music will certainly obliterate anything
    I create over a couple hundred years. A thousand and I''m definitely toast.</p>

    <p>Without those guiding principles in my life though, I''m not sure how to feel
    about my time on earth. I''ve found a profession I can sustain, but the world
    is not enriched by my output.  I wouldn''t even know what kind of work would enrich
    the world. Life has simply come to feel curiously meaningless.  Not in a depressing
    way, I just feel now that I''m an observer.  I feel like I''m just smelling the
    flowers, diverting myself before I go off to die.</p>

    <p>It''s not a terrible outlook, in fact I consider myself very lucky in my circumstances
    on earth, but it''s not exactly pleasant either.  I''m curios if you''ve encountered
    this feeling -- I''d love to know how you''ve dealt with it, particularly if you
    are older.  I''m afraid to say I think this outlook is at least partly shaded
    by age, by having found the limits of your own ability.</p>

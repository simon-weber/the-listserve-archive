<p>I'm looking for responses here; advice from you. I'm 30 years old and much of the sense of purpose in my life has drifted away.</p>
<p>When I was younger I had aspirations to do two things: to become a biologist and to write music.  Those pursuits were intended to give a backbone to my life.  To expand the boundaries of human knowledge and to create a permanent record of my thoughts passed down through the ages.</p>
<p>As I got older those things became less satisfying.  The realities of life as a biologist turned me off from pursuing it as a career.  As for music, the idea that it is in any way permanent began to feel absurd.  Technology and ephemeral taste and the vast expanse of existing music will certainly obliterate anything I create over a couple hundred years. A thousand and I'm definitely toast.</p>
<p>Without those guiding principles in my life though, I'm not sure how to feel about my time on earth. I've found a profession I can sustain, but the world is not enriched by my output.  I wouldn't even know what kind of work would enrich the world. Life has simply come to feel curiously meaningless.  Not in a depressing way, I just feel now that I'm an observer.  I feel like I'm just smelling the flowers, diverting myself before I go off to die.</p>
<p>It's not a terrible outlook, in fact I consider myself very lucky in my circumstances on earth, but it's not exactly pleasant either.  I'm curios if you've encountered this feeling -- I'd love to know how you've dealt with it, particularly if you are older.  I'm afraid to say I think this outlook is at least partly shaded by age, by having found the limits of your own ability.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing from you,</p>

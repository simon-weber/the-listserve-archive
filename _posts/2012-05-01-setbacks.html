<p>In 2006, I worked as a business journalist and did fun things like flying around the world to interview executives and reporting about what really rich people do with their money.  I had a 9-to-5 job and an awesome salary. Three years later, the financial crisis hit and I, along with thousands of other people, was out of a job.  So, for the first few days of my unemployment, I did what any other right-minded woman would do: I went to all of the sample sales that were happening during the daytime in New York and bought a lot of shoes. Eventually, my dwindling bank account forced me to open up my laptop and scour the Internet for jobs.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no activity more disheartening than searching for jobs. Except watching an episode of &#8220;The Real Housewives of Atlanta&#8221; while you&#8217;re out of a job, which I did, and it sucked. I applied for 23 jobs, and after each rejection, I spiraled down a path of self-doubt, uncertainty and depression.  I had no direction in life. I felt like I was underwater, and I didn&#8217;t know which way was up.</p>
<p>In my misery, I started to try new things. I learned how to cook.  I took up tango dancing.  I read Harry Potter in Spanish.  I bought a harmonica so I could sing away my blues.</p>
<p>I dared to try all of these things that I never had the courage to do before. But my biggest dare by far was to abandon the job search and apply to art school, to a program called ITP. Never in a million years did I think I would apply to art school.  But the next two years were the most fun, the most challenging and the most rewarding times of my life.  I learned how to program phone apps, make robots, create art and do things that I never thought I was capable of doing.</p>
<p>When I lost my job, I was poor, eating cliff bars for meals and collecting free samples of eye cream from Sephora. Today, I am still poor, eating cliff bars for meals and collecting free samples of eye cream from Sephora.  What&#8217;s different, however, is my preconceived notion of my career path and who I am.  Hitting rock bottom was the catalyst for me to reinvent myself and try things I never thought I could do.  Like, I used to want to be a journalist.  Now, I want to be a NBA basketball player. ;p</p>
<p>So, we will all undoubtedly hit many setbacks in our life. But embrace them because it&#8217;s a good kick-in-the-pants to try something new. Your &#8220;failures&#8221; could turn out to be the best experiences of your life.</p>

    body: "My name is Adam. I am 28 years old and I was born in Maryland, USA. I studied\
      \ Criminal Justice at Penn State University and graduated in 2008. Then I spent\
      \ my early 20's living abroad in Spain, China, Argentina, and Brazil. Three\
      \ years ago I settled in San Francisco, California and became an English teacher.\r\
      \n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would liken my (or, the ubiquitous) first year teaching experience\
      \ to learning how to swim by method of being chucked mercilessly into a frigid,\
      \ choppy, bottomless ocean. And as you drift away, excited to learn or just\
      \ terrified, you\u2019re not sure which, you barely hear the last words of encouragement\
      \ you\u2019re going to hear in what will feel like eternities: \"Swimming's\
      \ easy! You'll figure it out eventually! Careful not to drown first! And watch\
      \ out for the Sharks!\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe students call me Mr. Hurwitz\
      \ and I hear my name ALL day \u2013 both a point of pride and an enormous burden.\r\
      \n\r\n\r\n\r\nI teach 6th grade English at a large public middle school in Oakland,\
      \ California. Monday through Friday from 8am to 3pm, I'm in a classroom with\
      \ 32 11 and 12 year olds. Right now we're reading The Giver by Lois Lowry and\
      \ we are loving it. We read a couple chapters together, then we discuss, or\
      \ we write, or both. Rinse and repeat. For the complete recipe, add:\r\n\r\n\
      \r\n\r\n-Google Chromebooks and nifty educational websites (Schoology, Flocabulary,\
      \ Quizlet, NoRedInk, TypingClub)\r\n\r\n-stickers, stamps, and letter grades\r\
      \n\r\n-handwriting practice (seriously, every now and then, they LOVE it)\r\n\
      \r\n-music (we bump Spotify in class whenever possible)\r\n\r\n-physical movement\
      \ (A LOT)\r\n\r\n-SSR (Sustained Silent Reading, 27 minutes every day after\
      \ lunch)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand of course...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-laughs, smiles, tears,\
      \ bandaids, ungodly amounts of kleenex and hand sanitizer, pencil shavings and\
      \ eraser crumbs, and forgotten sweatshirts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo me, the best part\
      \ about being a teacher is feeling needed so much...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n... By all\
      \ the students, who need knowledge and discipline and fun and praise and love\
      \ and support and empathy in order to grow into healthy, happy adults who serve\
      \ their community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n... By the single student, one in tears because\
      \ her backpack and lunch bag stolen were from her locker, or one who has trouble\
      \ making friends, or one who wants me to help her with the book she wrote, or\
      \ even one who just needs attention so bad because no one at home hugs him,\
      \ so he stomps around the classroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n... By a parent, who shows\
      \ up to my classroom on the verge of tears 45 minutes after I message her to\
      \ say that her son, who I know well, isn\u2019t focusing in class and is directing\
      \ some disrespectful language towards me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n... By my colleagues,\
      \ with whom I share the same students who excel, the same students who struggle,\
      \ the same physical space, the same lesson plans, the same passion for exhausting\
      \ and challenging and fulfilling work, the same coffee, and the same Professional\
      \ Development sessions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n... And by the Oakland community- rich\
      \ in diversity and natural beauty, but generally malnourished and segregated-\
      \ which needs role models for its youth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a teacher, when I\
      \ feel needed, I feel honored. When I satisfy other's needs, I feel confident.\
      \ When I handle a situation with the utmost positivity and conscientiousness\
      \ and empathy, I feel proud, free even. When I fail or flounder or treat another\
      \ poorly, I feel deep remorse and embarrassment and frustration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\
      \r\nI'd really like to say thank you for reading, truly. I invite you to respond\
      \ to my words. As an introvert the most exciting part of writing my own Listserve\
      \ post is not the opportunity to say something to 24,000 people all over the\

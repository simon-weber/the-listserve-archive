    body: "My cousin got married last night. She is the first among my generation\
      \ to get married, so this is the first time in over a decade that this branch\
      \ of the family has been all in one place. Right now many of the people I care\
      \ most about are recovering in the next room. The ceremony was beautiful, the\
      \ food was wonderful, and a 10PM noise ordinance means we will talk forever\
      \ about the cops shuting down the DJ at the reception.\r\n\r\nSo here is my\
      \ advice:\r\n\r\nLove your family. You don't always have to like them, but love\
      \ them when you can.\r\n\r\nDon't stress the small stuff - it isn't a real party\
      \ till the cops show up. (Or someone stomps off in a huff.)\r\n\r\nTravel -\
      \ many of the guests (myself included) traveled 12+ hours to this party and\
      \ not one person regrets a moment of it.\r\n\r\nLive in the moment - Grandma\
      \ can\u2019t remember anything that happened 5 seconds ago, but she spent hours\
      \ last night in her chair at the party watching everything. She had no idea\
      \ what was happening or who was getting married but she was thrilled to be at\
      \ the party.\r\n\r\nThat said, I hope you all have a chance to be as happy as\
      \ I am right now. I have my family around me, beautiful vistas of the mountains\
      \ of Tuscon outside the windows, and nothing to do but bask in the post-wedding\
      \ serenity until my 7AM flight tomorrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nBecki\t\r\nintrepidcat@gmail.com\t\
      \r\nWashington DC\r\n\r\n"

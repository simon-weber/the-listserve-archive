      <p> in case you like non-fiction books, you should consider reading the following
      : <br />"And the band played on" - from Randy Shilts : great piece of journalism
      about the aids epidemics in the 80s, how they tracked the virus, how they struggled

      <p>Part II : What I want from you as a captive audience</p>

      <p>I''ve been studying a dual degree in law and economics in Paris, decided
      to chose law over economics. I naturally went to business law, as most dual
      degree students do (banking &amp; finance). Usually, people quit because of
      the heavy workload / repetitiveness of the job. I was actually ok with both,
      had issues finding a meaning though - I have a potential job offer waiting for
      that I pass the bar exam, and am considering whether I should go for it.</p>

      <p>I''m planning to move to Human Rights / Criminal law. However, I have many
      stereotypes about people working in this area (I''m afraid they''d sometimes
      be more into ideology than actually fighting for their clients) - though I hope
      I''m wrong. Anyone in the listserve did this move (business law --&gt; human
      rights law) before ? Or just work in human rights / criminal law ? If yes, please
      feel free to reach out and prove me wrong on my stereotypes.</p>

      <p>I''d also love to work abroad as a lawyer. Options are limited as I''ve only
      studied French law. I''ve thought of international criminal litigation (ICC
      proceedings for instance), but I''m not even sure there''s more than pro bono
      in this field. Anyone is making a living out of this or knows someone who is

    body: "Hello, strangers!\r\n\r\nMy name is Yasmim and I\u2019m passionate about\
      \ traveling. I'm 21 years old and I am proud to say that I already visited 11\
      \ countries. My last trip was in august/2013, when I traveled across Europe\
      \ all by myself. My next stop will be: California and Vegas! yay!\r\n\r\nOne\
      \ of the most important things that travelling has taught me is: there are much\
      \ more good people than bad people in the world. My experience as a lonely traveler\
      \ shown me that there are much more people willing to help a stranger than you\
      \ could imagine. Strangers in train stations helped me to carry my luggages;\
      \ strangers gave me all kind of information that I needed and made my traveling\
      \ a lot more easier; among several others things. Those strangers helped me\
      \ without asking for anything in return (except for some beggars in Rome, but\
      \ that's another story).\r\n\r\nIn 2012 I was in Lousiana on a job exchange\
      \ program (I worked in a Wendy's but that's also another story, haha). My friends\
      \ and I were dying to go to New Orleans to see the Mardi Gras parade (and, of\
      \ course, the party). However, we didn't have a car and couldn't rent one because\
      \ of our age... So we decided to ask for a ride on the road. Ok, I know that\
      \ was a little bit risky (maybe a lot). Anyway, a stranger took us safely to\
      \ New Orleans and gave us a lot of city tips.\r\n\r\nAll of my traveling experiences\
      \ were positives and I do not believe that was a question of luck. Of course,\
      \ THERE ARE bad people in the world, so you must be careful! But, sometimes,\
      \ just trust. Like in that Coca-cola advertising: there are reasons to believe!\
      \ The world still is an horrible place but I guarantee you that\u2019s not as\
      \ evil as the media show us. Sometimes I have the feeling that we live in a\
      \ permanent paranoia about safety! Of course we must have some precautions,\
      \ but we can't stop living because of fear.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, that\u2019s my advice\
      \ for you, strangers: put some faith in humanity and don't be afraid of trusting\
      \ :)\r\n\r\n\r\np.s.: do you live in California/Vegas and have any travel tips?\
      \ Please, email me!\r\np.s. 2: do you live anywhere in the world and have any\
      \ travel tips? Please, email me!\r\np.s. 3: not exactly related, but If you\

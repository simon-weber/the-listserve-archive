      <p>For the past year, I have been seeking something that would make me happy.
      Little did I know, there was something, someone, that had been there all along.
      Someone I had been overlooking. Whether related to a relationship or a career,
      I have been chasing this &#8220;ideal&#8221; that society built for me, a socially
      constructed ideal, if you will. While I was chasing this ideal, I denied who
      I was and my passions along with it, but then, in a class with Dr. Cynthia McClintock,
      I found her.</p>

      <p>I wanted to take both the LSAT and the GMAT because I thought that law school
      and business school would direct me toward a stable, socially acceptable career.<br
      />She is passionate about Latin America and China, and wants nothing more than
      to work to strengthen the China-Latin America relationship. Her love for Latin
      America and her roots in China perfectly meshed together.<br />I chased after
      jobs with consulting firms thinking that I would be happy with a ridiculously
      high salary and crazy hours. I thought I wanted to work for marketing companies
      and join their creative teams to make the best ads.<br />She knew that to chase
      after opportunities working to ameliorate the relations between the two parties
      would make her happy, really, really, happy. For her, this passion has been
      there all along and it made absolute sense. In this class, she found a place
      where external factors and society could not direct her path. She looked within
      herself, to find what was already there, what has always been there.</p>

      <p>Three weeks ago, I took off my blinders. I looked outside the overwhelming
      socially constructed ideals I had used to shape my ambitions and interpret my
      passions.<br />Three weeks ago, I met someone who could make me happy.</p>

      <p>Just in time for graduation, I realized that someone is me. I have decided

      <p>So if you hear of any Latin America-China opportunities, I would appreciate
      it if you could pass it along. I will be looking for openings in Washington,
      D.C. but also in Latin America and China starting this July.</p>

      "food for thought" to everyone of you.</p>

      <p>1) Developing skills and competence that suit your character, and utilizing
      them is a crucial life task. Don''t do something you need to do - become really

      <p>2) "Someone who walks slow, still goes faster than somebody standing still".
      Actually starting something, even if it''s slow, is better than not starting
      it at all. Also, progress requires goals, and growth - otherwise you might stop
      walking.</p>

      <p>3) Infinity isn''t just "large" - it''s not a static entity, like a huge
      number. It''s just used to describe the lack of any boundaries. Also see "Infinite
      monkey theorem", Graham''s number.</p>

      <p>4) Causality chain: Everything that happens is a result of a long chain of
      other events. If one event in this chain would''ve been different, the whole
      outcome might have been completely different as well. Every fraction of a second
      counts. Think about a specific occurence, and track back all the little things
      that lead to it. You can go backwards in chain links forever, and if a coincidence
      didn''t happen at the correct second, everything could''ve been different. It
      might sound a bit extreme, but after all it seems that our entire existence
      is based on a huge chain of accurate events. See also: Chaos theory, butterfly
      effect, determinism.</p>

      <p>5) In regards to 4), coincidence really is amazing and one of the most powerful
      things. Some might believe in destiny or fate, but after all, the universe is
      a complex and dynamic system, where everything affects each other. Try out as

      to "experience coincidence", so many options might come towards you.</p>

      <p>6)  In the end, only memories stay, and you''re only experiencing the presence.
      So the underlying reasoning behind all our actions might be experiencing as

      <p>7) The reason we procrastinate is because we value the presence much more
      than the uncertain future. Enjoyment (=reward) right now &gt; possible benefits
      in the future.</p>

      <p>8) "A man convinced against his will, is of the same opinion still". If you

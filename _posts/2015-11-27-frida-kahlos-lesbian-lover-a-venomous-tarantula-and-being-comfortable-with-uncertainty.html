      \ singer who lived to age 93. She passed away in 2012 after a life lived to\
      \ all extremes and in defiance of decades of alcoholism. Chavela's voice is\
      \ sandpaper, cigar smoke, spilled tequila, hard kisses, resistance and longing.\
      \ I first heard her voice in college, where my queer Latin@ self was experimenting\

      \ Elizabeth Taylor, Ava Gardner, and, most famously, Frida Kahlo. Two weeks\
      \ ago, perusing Google Images, I found a sepia photo of them embracing and laughing\

      \ those inimitable eyebrows. My heart leaped to see this moment of joy in the\
      \ lives of two young lovers who, history has shown, experienced sorrow and heartbreak\

      \ drank herself to oblivion, and eventually bottomed-out from an internationally-lauded\
      \ singing career, and because of all this, she is my MUSE. I'm a DJ, singer\
      \ and electronic music producer (Soundcloud: MAMBISA) who loves throbbing basslines,\
      \ layering folk songs with kicks and snares, staying up til sunrise drinking\
      \ tequila, and pouring out my heart to friends and strangers. There aren't many\
      \ well-known female DJ/producers, but my friends and I show our anger about\

      \ Chavela has shown me I can be both masculine and feminine, queer and seemingly\

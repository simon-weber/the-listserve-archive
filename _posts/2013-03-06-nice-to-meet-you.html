<p>Hello there, I hope you are having a great day! I'm not great on the whole "inspirational messages" thing, so here's just some stuff about me:</p>
<p>I get to live in New Zealand with my beautiful wife and 4 (soon to be 5!) children.</p>
<p>Biking to and from my office in town is one of the best parts of the day.</p>
<p>Playing board games is one of my favourite past times. They are mentally stimulating, socially engaging, and enjoyable! Check out boardgamegeek for some recommendations.</p>
<p>I am one of eleven people across the globe who work at a web development company called Lincoln Loop. It is run transparently - we all have access to all the financials and we set our own pay rates. And it's fun!</p>
<p>We actually used Google wave, so following its demise we made a communications platform of our own. It helps me feel connected to what's going on at work even though it's happening continents away. Search for "ginger hq" to check it out.</p>
<p>My favourite quote is "No matter where a tree falls, it lies where it fell".</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, random stranger! I'd love to discuss anything or hear about you too - send me a message.</p>

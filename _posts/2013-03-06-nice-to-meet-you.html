      \nI get to live in New Zealand with my beautiful wife and 4 (soon to be 5!)\
      \ children.\r\n\r\nBiking to and from my office in town is one of the best parts\
      \ of the day.\r\n\r\nPlaying board games is one of my favourite past times.\
      \ They are mentally stimulating, socially engaging, and enjoyable! Check out\
      \ boardgamegeek for some recommendations.\r\n\r\nI am one of eleven people across\
      \ the globe who work at a web development company called Lincoln Loop. It is\
      \ run transparently - we all have access to all the financials and we set our\
      \ own pay rates. And it's fun!\r\n\r\nWe actually used Google wave, so following\
      \ its demise we made a communications platform of our own. It helps me feel\
      \ connected to what's going on at work even though it's happening continents\
      \ away. Search for \"ginger hq\" to check it out.\r\n\r\nMy favourite quote\

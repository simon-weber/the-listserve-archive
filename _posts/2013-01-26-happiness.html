    body: "A bit rushed but, hello world!!\r\n\r\n\r\n Life is a funny little thing.\
      \ \r\n\r\nYou try your hardest for something, but don't get it. You can get\
      \ angry, cry, be frustrated and it will never happen. You don't expect it, and\
      \ it shows up on your doorstep. The thing you never sought to pursue is all\
      \ yours. \r\n\r\nIt could be as simple as a smile from a stranger. As rough\
      \ as an argument. A struggle in your journey. The memories of the past.\r\n\r\
      \nLife brings people together.\r\n\r\nIn the most strangest of ways. One day\
      \ they are there, and the next day they are gone. And then they come back again,\
      \ in a new light, and better than ever. It could be the start of something,\
      \ or the realisation that there is something better.\r\n\r\nLife is about the\
      \ moments.\r\n\r\nThe smiles, the laughs. The moments of butterflies and the\
      \ moments of deep despair. It is about the roller-coaster we experience as we\
      \ lean in for our first kiss, the pit in our stomach as we walk away. The way\
      \ they feel when we run into their arms, when we see our children, when we are\
      \ travelling across the world landscape.\r\n\r\nLife is simple.\r\n\r\nStanding\
      \ in the rain. Smelling in the freshly cut lawn. Hearing the waves as they softly\
      \ lap the shore. Feeling the heat from their hand.\r\n\r\nLife is happiness.\r\
      \n\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nAnd to you,\r\n\r\nI really enjoy\
      \ spending time with you, even if we're just going to be sitting around and\
      \ talking about nothing. There are a million things I love about you, like your\
      \ nose or the way you smile, the way you look me in the eye, too. And I just\
      \ get the greatest feeling when I make you laugh. I feel as if my company makes\
      \ you happy, and that's what I wish for you; for you to be happy. And when I\
      \ see you laugh at my clumsy ways, it just makes me want to spend the rest of\
      \ my life with you so I can see a smile on your face.      -- from Tumblr\r\n\
      \r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\n\"To love at all is to be vulnerable.\
      \ Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want\
      \ to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an\
      \ animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxiries; avoid all\
      \ entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness.\
      \ But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will\
      \ not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To\
      \ love is to be vulnerable.\"      -- CS Lewis, The Four Loves\r\n\r\n-----------------------------\r\
      \n\r\n\"We often take for granted the very things that most deserve our gratitude.\"\

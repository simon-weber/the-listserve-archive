<p class="meta">June 21 2013</p>

<p>Try to imagine a life without timekeeping.</p>
<p>You probably can't. You know the month, the year, the day of the week. There is a clock on your wall or the dashboard of your car. You have a schedule, a calendar, a time for dinner or a movie. Yet all around you, timekeeping is ignored. Birds are not late. A dog does not check its watch. Deer do not fret over passing birthdays.</p>
<p>Man alone measures time. Man alone chimes the hour. And, because of this, man alone suffers the paralysing fear that no other creatures endures. A fear of time running out.  </p>

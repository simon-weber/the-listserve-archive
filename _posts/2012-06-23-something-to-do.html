<p>Hello Listserve!</p>
<p>I'm writing this from my hotel room in Auckland, New Zealand. First trip out of Australia and I'm loving it! </p>
<p>Last night we dropped in to The Shakespeare for a quick beer on the walk home.  Wow, What a pub! They brew their own beer in behind the bar. If you're in the area I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>Brewing beer is a very rewarding hobby which I recommend every beer lover try at least once. I don't mean those tins of extract you get from the supermarket, brew it from grain! The experience really helped me enjoy some of the excellent craft beers available to us now. </p>
<p>I tried the 'brew in a bag' method in a large pot on my stove. It only brewed about 24 bottles but they were mine! I had a great time adding the ingredients and seeing how it changed the flavours before and after it was bottled. </p>
<p>The first pour and taste was so rewarding, I had no idea if I had done it right or wrong or what to expect. To have this beer that I crafted myself from raw ingredients was the best thing ever. </p>
<p>Go on, give it a crack. It'll only cost you about $50 to get set up and a day of your time. </p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Oh, and Sarah, I love you with all my heart :)</p>

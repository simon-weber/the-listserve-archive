    body: "My husband and I have been together for 12 years, we met in college, dated\r\
      \nfor 6 years and got married 6 years ago. I often forget just how much\r\n\
      we've been through during that time (good and bad): the ups and downs of\r\n\
      college, family deaths, graduation, grad school, first jobs, not knowing\r\n\
      how we'll pay the bills, buying a first home, and\u0160babies (!). And even\r\
      \nwhen I sit here and write this, I know there are countless things I'm\r\n\
      forgetting.\r\n\r\nHe's my person (anyone watch Grey's Anatamoy?). I can always\
      \ count on him.\r\nHe knows me best. Basically, he's my rock.\r\n\r\nBut, at\
      \ the end of the day I love him the most because he makes me laugh.\r\nNot just\
      \ giggle or chuckle. I'm talking the deepest, most uncontrollable,\r\neye watering\
      \ belly laugh that you can possibly imagine. There's nothing\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\
      \nSo, my message is this: If you're with someone and you're not having fun\r\
      \nin your relationship, it's not worth it. Your \"person\" should be able to\r\
      \nbring out the best in you and be able to make you laugh uncontrollably\r\n\
      (and you the same to them). It's pretty simple really.\r\n\r\nAlso, listen to\
      \ your kids (or just kids in general). I mean reeeeally\r\nlisten. My 2 year\
      \ old points out the most obvious things that I take for\r\ngranted everyday.\
      \ She's helped me see (and hear) the world around me in a\r\ncompletely fresh\
      \ light. Try it, you'll be amazed.\r\n\r\nLike my advice? Don't like it? Either\

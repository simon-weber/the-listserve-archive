<p>I once rode a Greyhound bus from Kansas to Iowa in a raving snow storm. Semis were flipped in the ditches; visibility was less than a few feet. But our driver must&#8217;ve been on something that made all this crazy feel like paradise, because he didn&#8217;t waver. I thought I was going to die that night.</p>
<p>I sat next to a bearded Canadian, maybe 30 years my senior. An out of work electrical engineer, &#8220;just passing through.&#8221; We exchanged few words most of the way, passing the first six hours in near silence, white-knuckling the arm rests. But at some point, maybe we&#8217;d both realized that our fate was out of our hands, so why not lighten up, get to know our neighbor? We started up a conversation. I eventually asked him if he had ever seen anything he couldn&#8217;t explain.</p>
<p>Just like that, the question slipped out. It&#8217;s so personal, I thought, so eerie, and yet he didn&#8217;t miss a beat. He told me a story I repeat to this day, 15 years later, like I am right here. He told me that he was camping in Arizona, and as dusk approached, he realized he needed to hurry to find a spot to pitch his tent. He walked into the desert from the road, about a quarter mile, and turned a corner. There, he told me this so matter of factly that I have no doubt he saw this, was a deer, sitting upright, on a rock, legs crossed like a perfect gentleman. I immediately thought of the Gary Larson cartoon where cows are standing on two legs chatting, and a lookout cow shouts out that a car is coming and everyone resume their positions. The Canadian electrical engineer offered nothing more, and little surprise, really. To this day, I ask this question of people from time to time, and I&#8217;d love to hear your story.</p>
<p>Please reply with an answer to the question: Have you ever seen anything you couldn&#8217;t explain. If I get enough answers, I&#8217;m going to build a website as a sort of repository of your stories.</p>

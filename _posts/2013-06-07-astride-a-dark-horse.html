    body: "My name is Ryan. I'm 30 years old and I live on a houseboat on the canals\
      \ of London, England.\r\n\r\nMy boat's name is the Dark Horse.  I have owned\
      \ it for 5 months. I am told that the constant fear of sinking eventually goes\
      \ away.\r\n\r\nThe boat was built in 1974. It is 50ft long and 10ft wide, with\
      \ every square foot replete in only the finest in late 70's wood-panelling.\
      \ Its heart is a marinised BMC engine - the same kind that used to be found\
      \ in black London taxis - and, like most of those who partied hard through the\
      \ 70's, it has a tendency to occasionally forget who it is and what it's doing,\
      \ and to suddenly and violently require a bit of a lie-down. This usually involves\
      \ loud noises and, occasionally, smoke.\r\n(When I purchased the boat from an\
      \ elderly widower, she gave me a 'Good Luck' card instead of a 'Thank You' card.\
      \ In retrospect this should have been something of a clue.)\r\n\r\nAs I have\
      \ no permanent mooring (due, for the most part, to the scarcity of new mooring\
      \ spots in London), my boat operates under what's called a 'continuous cruising\
      \ license.' Besides being the basis for some truly terrible pickup lines, this\
      \ entails being legally obligated to move the boat to a new neighbourhood every\
      \ two weeks.\xB9  This has proven to be my favourite part of the boating life\
      \ thus far.  Waking up to the sound of joggers along the towpath at Victoria\
      \ Park is very different to waking up to the gentle splash of a rower on the\
      \ River Lea or to the distant sound of a genuine Camden punk being heartily\
      \ sick. The experience has broadened my appreciation of London and its environs.\r\
      \n\r\nBut the boat life isn't all glamorous 70's decor, punk vomit, and hastily\
      \ purchased Hallmark cards.  There are also downsides.\r\nBesides the aforementioned\
      \ threat of sinking and the obvious, constant danger of scurvy, the waterways\
      \ of England are also infested with swans.  While in the past the Queen (the\
      \ only person legally allowed to kill swans in the United Kingdom\xB2) has done\
      \ a fine job of culling back the white-winged menace, her age and subsequent\
      \ wavering aim has meant she's far less capable of wielding the royal machete\
      \ than once she was. As a result, the swans, emboldened, have taken to hanging\
      \ around in groups, smoking cigarettes, and making lewd comments at passing\
      \ womenfolk.  We boaters have thus far managed to endure this outrage through\
      \ sheer willpower, numerous cups of tea, and the sound knowledge that should\
      \ ever Prince Harry take the throne, he's likely to bring the full force of\
      \ the British army against these beautiful, feathered abominations.\r\n\r\n\
      That day is to be found in the distant future, though, if at all, and so until\

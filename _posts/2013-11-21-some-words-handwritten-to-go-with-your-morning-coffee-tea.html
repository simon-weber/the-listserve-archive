    <p>===<br />noon, saturday, spring 2013: just watched ''a place at the table''
    with my class.</p>

    <p>we got to talk to barbie, one of the film&#8217;s subjects after the movie,
    and she made me realize: hunger, homelessness, desperation, need- these are all
    subjective. she''s right, each time we mention poverty we think of emaciated children
    curled up under the relentless african sun, haunting eyes against dark skin, a
    mother&#8217;s fingers fitting perfectly into the contours of her son&#8217;s
    ribs. but hunger is real and hunger is also here, right here, in rundown towns
    of the midwest and in food insecure belts without delivery of fresh fruit or vegetables.
    imagine living in a town where the only fruit available is a bunch of bananas
    on a grimy store countertop. one bunch for a whole town. imagine never knowing
    the taste of an apple.</p>

    <p>and yet here, in new york: we strut out of whole foods glowing with pride.
    we carry brown paper bags full of organic berries, cage-free eggs, unsweetened

    thinking, we are better than chef boyardee&#8217;s, better than special k, jell-o,

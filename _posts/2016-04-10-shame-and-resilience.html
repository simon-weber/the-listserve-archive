    body: "Spirituality, Psychosis, Travel, Trauma, BDSM (all mixed up)\r\n\r\nGreetings,\r\
      \n\r\nSince I\u2019m me, I want to talk about me.\r\n\r\nThere is a lot to say.\
      \ Sorry if I\u2019m not very articulate. I'm writing this last minute due to\
      \ my procrastination and a funeral yesterday.\r\n\r\nI recently turned 24, I\
      \ always like to explore. At 21, I quit my corporate job and dropped out of\
      \ college to travel the world. I managed to travel the states.\r\n\r\nI prepared\
      \ for a year and saved my money. In November 2013 I began my travels; I took\
      \ trains from the east coast to the west coast. With some money, a big backpack,\
      \ some clothes, some camping gear I headed out to nowhere. Met some nice people\
      \ and made lifelong friends. I stayed at some hostels. Worked on some farms.\
      \ Bought a camper van that lasted a little while. Did some camping and some\
      \ hiking. Got stranded on highway 1 (a whole story in itself.). Met a girl on\
      \ the run (a whole story in itself.) Picked up some hitchhikers (stories in\
      \ itself.). Did some hitchhiking. Learned a lot. Travelling alone for months\
      \ at a time was the best thing Iv'e ever done.\r\n\r\nI was on a journey to\
      \ give up giving up attachment\u2026.\r\n\r\nI learned a few things like \u201C\
      Always ask a blind man what he sees\u201D\r\n\r\nor \u201CChop the Buddha\u2019\
      s head off\u201D\r\n\r\nand \u201CSometimes when there is a sudden void, the\
      \ void rushes to be filled\".....\r\n\r\nIt was an objection to my projection,\
      \ seeking attention. \u201CWhere the attention goes energy flows.\u201D What\
      \ kind of attention did I seek? What kind of attention would I attract?\r\n\r\
      \nI grew up in a super insular suppressed religious community and I needed to\
      \ go explore myself.\r\n\r\nBack then I would say I was going to travel because\
      \ I needed to spend time alone. I ended up meeting hundreds of people. Mostly\
      \ wonderful people.\r\n\r\nOnly one psychopath. (Term used loosely) He traumatized\
      \ me. But he gave me a lot of insight into myself. He particularly gave me insight\
      \ into my biological mother (who I hadn't seen in many years). Who I subsequently\
      \ called.\r\n\r\nAfter getting away from this guy. I found myself doing yoga\
      \ for the first time in my life. I had been 'into' meditation for about two\
      \ years at the time.\r\nI met a fellow named Bill who did yoga with me. Outside\
      \ in sun.\r\n\r\nThen some strange things started coming together.\r\n\r\nAfter\
      \ years of my shoulders being by my ears my back started straightening out.\
      \ A strange tingling feeling ran up and down my spine. My body went from hot\
      \ to cold. I would lapse easily into a trance.\r\nI started going back to my\
      \ childhood. Things I have repressed.\r\n\r\nI sent home my 'spiritual books'\
      \ Ram Dass - Be Here Now and Alan Watts - The Way of Zen. There great. But I\
      \ had to face this on my own.\r\n\r\nI realized what I called: Trauma. It was\
      \ fucking staring me in the face a whole time.\r\n\r\nI cried and laughed. I\
      \ realized I had massive trauma from my childhood that I had been running from.\
      \ And I started realizing how it affected me. The way I interacted with people.\
      \ The type of people my energy attracted.\r\n\r\nA major point is: it wasn't\
      \ my fault. Stockholm syndrome comes to mind. Its survival. I never knew better.\
      \ A defense/ coping mechanism.\r\n\r\nTrauma attracts trauma. Trauma passes\
      \ trauma. Does trauma fix trauma?\r\n\r\nI also realized my suppression and\
      \ repression. Particularly sexually - which I will talk about.\r\n\r\nI'll say\
      \ my mother was quite abusive.\r\nI called my mother.\r\nI was up for days straight\
      \ without sleeping.\r\nManaged to lose all my belongings.\r\nGet arrested and\

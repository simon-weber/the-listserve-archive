      \ my favourite quotes at the moment. Hopefully they will make you feel better\
      \ like how they have done for me all these while. :) \r\n\r\n\"If you have good\
      \ thoughts, they will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always\
      \ look lovely.\"\r\n\r\nAs I grow older and enter the workforce, it seems like\
      \ people around me are just getting so mean and would anything just to achieve\
      \ what they want. But yes, staying positive and being kind even to those who\
      \ hurt us will make us all look lovely.\r\n\r\n\"Eventually all pieces fall\
      \ into place. Until then, laugh at the confusion, live for the moment, and know\
      \ that everything happens for a reason.\"\r\n\r\nGrowing up can be confusing\
      \ and depressing at times. I am currently at this stage of my life where I feel\
      \ so lost about my future, especially after facing so many obstacles within\
      \ half a year into my first proper job. So yup, I'm gonna try to gain as much\
      \ experience as I can instead of crying over spilled milk all the time.\r\n\r\
      \nI believe that some of you out there also have quotes that resonate with you,\
      \ or quotes that you live by. For example, my gluttony boyfriend always says\
      \ \"Leave no fries behind\" and he really meant it every time he said it.\r\n\
      \r\nWhat are yours? Feel free to share with me! Thank you for reading and be\
      \ happy everyday! :)\r\n\r\n\r\nLiwee\r\nbirdsandflora@gmail.com\r\nSingapore\r\

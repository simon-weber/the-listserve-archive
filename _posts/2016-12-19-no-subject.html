    body: "I thought the pawn shop empty but there she was, leaning over the glass\
      \ display next to me and staring deeply at the pieces for sale within. She was\
      \ beautiful in a retro-fringed jacket and faded jeans kind of way.\r\n\r\n\"\
      Ever wonder what they'd say if they could talk?\"\r\n\r\nI had not, and said\
      \ so but she'd moved on to look at dangling necklaces on a pewter tree. \"Everything\
      \ has a story to tell. Take this locket for example. Perhaps a young unwed mother\
      \ carried it next to her bosom with her newborn's photo inside, but debtors\
      \ care little for nostalgia.\"\r\n\r\nI gently opened the locket and showed\
      \ her the interior. \"Nice story, but it's empty.\"\r\n\r\nThe shop owner waved\
      \ to me from behind the counter and said, \"Your engagement ring is legit, so\
      \ how much you want for it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I paid quite a lot and it was only worn\
      \ once, so make me an offer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can go four hundred cash, six if you\
      \ want store credit. I've got some other nice jewelry...\"\r\n\r\nI shook my\
      \ head. \"Let the new chump buy her jewelry. Why don't I keep looking while\
      \ you help the young lady.\"\r\n\r\nThe owner glanced around the tiny shop.\
      \ \"Who are you talking about?\"\r\n\r\nThe mysterious woman had been looking\
      \ at a box of LPs by a sparsely filled coat rack, but she was gone. \r\n\r\n\
      \"Nevermind.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll write this up while you think about my offer.\"\
      \ He vanished behind a beaded curtain and left me alone with my thoughts.\r\n\
      \r\n\"The thing about stories is when one ends, another begins.\"\r\n\r\nI pivoted\
      \ and there she stood, like she'd never left.\r\n\r\n\"And how does this little\
      \ story end?\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled and said, \"Depends on you, of course.\" She\
      \ moved closer, hesitating mere inches away before sliding around and stopping\
      \ in front of a locked display. \"Pick one that interests you and I'll tell\
      \ you its story.\"\r\n\r\nI joined her at the case to inspect the items. Gold\
      \ coins sandwiched between plexiglass, an authentic china tea set, and a host\
      \ of other unremarkable items - at least to my untrained eye. I settled on a\
      \ slender pen and pencil set of polished rosewood nestled in an ebony box.\r\
      \n\r\n\"What about that writing set?\"\r\n\r\nHer lips curled slightly. \"Perceptive.\
      \ Those were a gift to a handsome fraud from a childhood sweetheart blinded\
      \ by love. The only time they left the box was on the couple's wedding night\
      \ when she learned of his infidelity and used the pen to tearfully write a final\
      \ note before ending her life.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet she regretted that decision.\"\
      \r\n\r\n\"Indeed. Second chances are rare, so when they appear...\"\r\n\r\n\"\
      Grab them before they're gone.\" As if on cue, I heard the beads rustle and\
      \ turned to the owner. \"Isn't that right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are you talking to?\"\
      \r\n\r\nI turned and she had disappeared. Again.\r\n\r\nHe held up a slip. \"\
      Shall I make it out for cash or store credit?\"\r\n\r\nLike the woman had said,\
      \ everything has a story to tell and my pitiful tale would soon reside in a\
      \ pawn shop display case along with other abandoned treasures.\r\nSome stories\
      \ deserve a better ending, I thought.\r\n. . . \r\nLeaving the shop, I felt\
      \ the ebony box shift in my pocket and a cool wind caressed my cheek.\r\n\r\n\
      \"I'd given up hope,\" I heard her say.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" I said without\
      \ turning my head. \"I never got your name.\"\r\n\r\nFaint laughter tickled\
      \ my ear as I felt a ghostly arm slip into mine and sensed a new story was just\
      \ beginning.\r\n\r\nCarl Rauscher\r\nGaithersburg, MD\r\n\r\n\r\n"

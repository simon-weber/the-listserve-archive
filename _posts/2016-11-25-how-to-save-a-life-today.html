      \ called Effective Altruism has been studying exactly how to do the most good\

      \ save a life (follow GiveWell.org for amazing charity research). We also need\
      \ to stand against hatred and change the systems that perpetuate poverty and\
      \ conflict \u2013 but we can take a tremendous first step by eliminating the\

      \ day after day.\r\n\r\nImagine if, one day, you walked by a burning building\

      \ maybe the best day of your life.\r\n\r\nYou don\u2019t need to walk by a burning\

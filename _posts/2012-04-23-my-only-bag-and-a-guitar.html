    body: 'When I turned twenty I had reached a point where my earthly possessions
      could be summarized as the clothes I was wearing, an old bag containing some
      more clothes, a few science-fiction books, and my guitar. No money, no place
      to live, just a bunch of friends who helped me out of the streets and put me
      back on my feet.


      Ending up in such a pit you first feel anger, then sorrow, then you make fun
      of it because that is the only way to make it bearable, and then you can go
      forward. It took me three more years to be able to shop for food without having
      to count change in my pockets.


      Twenty years later I gave the books away but I still keep the old bag as a memory
      and my guitar is now standing in the living-room where I occasionally use it
      to sing for my kids.


      Life has been a tough ride so far, but at least I know how to live without being
      bothered by simple objects. I know the only things you can count on are:

      - What is inside you: your skills, your knowledge

      - Good friends, and other people you love


      Be generous and help somebody today get out of poverty. We all deserve a future.

      <p>These are some things I''ve learned which guide the way I think, and which
      I value most. I hope they are the most valuable things I can offer to you. Of
      course, they come entirely from others, who I''ve paraphrased or quoted below.
      (I''ll reference at the bottom.)</p>

      <p>There is more advice and knowledge than I can ever consume. Most of it is
      probably good and useful to some extent. Hence, choice and prioritization are
      even more important.</p>

      <p>The way something is presented is often more important than its content.
      The most important part of the way something is presented is how long it takes
      someone to consume it.</p>

      <p>Time is the most important thing I have: "it has been said that time is money.
      That proverb understates the case. Time is a great deal more than money. If
      you have time you can obtain money--usually. But though you have the wealth
      of a cloak-room attendant at the Carlton Hotel, you cannot buy yourself a minute
      more time than I have, or the cat by the fire has" (Bennett).</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ll spend maybe a third of my life sleeping. Traditionally, another
      third working, but: "there&#8217;s a common misconception that work is necessary.
      You will meet people working at miserable jobs. They tell you they are ''making
      a living''. No, they&#8217;re not. They&#8217;re dying, frittering away their
      fast-extinguishing lives doing things which are, at best, meaningless and, at
      worst, harmful. People will tell you that work ennobles you, that work lends
      you a certain dignity. Work makes you free. The slogan &#8220;Arbeit macht frei&#8221;

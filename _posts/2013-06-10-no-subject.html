<p>I am not brave but even after writing this the world will have changed, you and I included. Breath and thoughts, come and go and leave us different, full or missing.</p>
<p>One of the most common things people say about me is that I&#8217;m quiet. I hear it time &amp; time again from those I just met &amp; even from those who&#8217;ve known me for some time. Despite this, 2 years ago &amp; in need of a job I started working at the zoo as a tour guide/bus driver, after a rough estimate I&#8217;ve calculated that I have given a tour to about 30,000 people. Yet those people and most of the people in my life won&#8217;t know as much about me than those of you that read this will at the end of this email.</p>
<p>I am not brave but I seem to be surrounded by people that are, if for no other reason than they have no choice.</p>
<p>My mom&#8217;s boyfriend was diagnosed with M.S. 7-8 years ago when he was in his 30&#8216;s. News of which I learned while I was living in Colorado. Now that I have been back home for a couple of years I see the effects that this disease has had on him and also on my mom. I continue to try to walk around in a world where this doesn&#8217;t or won&#8217;t eventually effect me. Impermeable to the changes this disease will continue to reap on my family, only to wake up one day wondering how I washed up on shore with everyone else.</p>
<p>My cousin, the closest thing to a sister I have and who I have been very close with for most of my life until recently, tried to kill herself. My aunt came to me crying. My cousin has had a rough roll. Kicked out of her house while still in her teens for &#8220;coming out&#8221;, about 10 years ago. Since that time she has moved in &amp; out of her parents home, while they all learn to live with circumstance neither of them are willing to compromise, my cousin&#8217;s side understandably. She hasn&#8217;t talked to me for almost a year, though I have tried to reach out to her. I don&#8217;t know how to reach her now without scaring her away. I can only think that the catalyst of this deep sadness comes from not being fully accepted by her family. I am not brave. She has been. I have known that I like woman for about as long as she, yet you know what people know about me? That I am quiet. She&#8217;s come out to the people that matter while I hide behind uncertainty. The best I can do is tell you all that I am a woman who likes other women. One day people are just going to have to deal with it, including myself.</p>
<p>I am not brave but still I change with you, breathing as you are and things as you do, but not as  you do. Even now I hide behind my computer, hide behind a white blank page that I fill with black letters, words, and sentences that run on too long with incomplete &amp; unstable thoughts, shades of gray riddled within the meanings. The gaps in between the letters could fit a multitude of universes where inconsistency &amp; indecision and themselves live. These universes that I drift in and out of from day to day. I&#8217;ll hide behind your courage, using your circumstances as a crutch to stay un-brave.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not usually this somber but thank you for letting me vent.</p>

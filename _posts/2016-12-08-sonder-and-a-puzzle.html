      \ of their presentation - no personal details - and thus were chosen based on\
      \ the topic's merit and not the selectors' bias. More tech conferences and companies\
      \ should actively counteract bias in this way. My favorite talk was \"\"Coding\

      \ We've known each other since October 21, 2004, started dating on March 8,\
      \ 2005, and eloped in a park at 11:00 on December 13, 2014. For our one-year\
      \ wedding anniversary I convinced a bunch of family, friends and coworkers to\
      \ chip in and buy her a marker (or several) to complete her Copic Sketch marker\
      \ collection. Everyone got to pick which colors they wanted to give, I grouped\
      \ and labelled markers by giver, and then wrapped them all together in a big\
      \ box. Since then, Cat has created lots of amazing art with her markers, including\
      \ a set of Garbage Pail Kids artist sketch cards for Topps. You can find her\

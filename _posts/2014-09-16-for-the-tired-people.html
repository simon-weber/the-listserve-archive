      <p>So, I''m a brand-new 7th grade English teacher. I work in a school where
      something like 80% of the kids live below the poverty line. Many of them have
      families who are barely making it. Many of them wear the same clothes to school
      multiple days in a row. For many of them, school lunch is the only meal they
      will eat that day. Many of their parents struggle with drugs, alcoholism, or
      are incarcerated. And here I am, some 25-year-old white girl who saw Freedom
      Writers and wanted to make a difference. Want to know a secret? Some days, I
      feel like I have absolutely no idea what I''m doing. Yes, I do know some of
      what they''re going through, I guess - I grew up in a similar situation, at
      least financially. My single mom worked three jobs while going back to school,
      raising me, and supporting my great-grandma who has Alzheimer''s, but then she
      got cancer and we were on assistance for a while during my childhood. I had
      a grandmother who robbed my mom blind in the middle of all of this to pay off
      gambling debts. I''ve never met my dad and that''s admittedly always left a

      but every situation is different. I have no idea what it feels like, for instance,

      <p>On storytelling, climate change, and playfully exploring our futures.</p>

      <p>&#8212;</p>

      <p>There&#8217;s a glitch in the software system in the near future &#8211;
      what sort? How should I know, it&#8217;s in the future. The important part is
      that this glitch sends voicemails back to our time.</p>

      <p>And what do we hear? We hear voices from the cloud of many possible futures.
      We are eavesdropping on the many parallel paths our world could take. We get
      to listen to the messages that people leave for each other &#8211; by turns
      banal, mysterious, tender, and terrifying.</p>

      <p>&#8212;&#8212; Ready for a CHALLENGE? &#8212;&#8212;</p>

      <p>Take a moment to think about what one of those voicemails might sound like.</p>

      <p>PEOPLE: Who is calling? Who are they playing phone tag with? What&#8217;s
      their relationship?</p>

      <p>THE AUTHENTIC FUTURE: What clues you in that this is taking place in the
      future? What&#8217;s different?</p>

      <p>So why did I ask you to do that? Well, I think fiction can be a powerful
      tool to think about the future. Great technologists can tell us that when we
      network computers together it&#8217;ll be a powerful tool &#8211; but it takes
      writers of fiction like William Gibson and Neal Stephenson to help us imagine
      what that might mean on a personal level. Biologists can tell us that we can
      handcraft genetic code &#8211; but it takes an author like Margaret Atwood to
      help us envision what it could be like to live in that future.</p>

      <p>This makes fiction an ideal place to explore an issue like climate change.
      We hear all sorts of predictions about what climate change will mean in twenty,
      fourty, sixty years from now &#8211; they represent the cloud of possible futures.
      Most of those take a 10,000 mile, global perspective. Hearing those figures,
      it&#8217;s tough for me to take it in &#8211; to really understand what they
      could mean to me, or to my friends, or children.</p>

      <p>Let&#8217;s try something. Take a moment to revisit your voicemail. Has the
      climate changed in this future? How has your caller adapted? How does this show
      up in the voicemail?</p>

      <p>&#8212;&#8212; Ready to be BRAVE? &#8212;&#8212;</p>

      <p>Take the voicemail that you&#8217;ve come up with and call the FutureCoast

      <p>Hi, my name is Eriko, I''m a 20-year-old IT student here in the Philippines.
      I''ve been watching anime ever since I was a kid and up to now I''m still doing
      it. I''m thankful to the internet because it gave me free access to new anime
      episodes straight from Japan. It''s pretty awesome to still continue a hobby
      that I have from when I was a little lamb. I started watching anime over the
      internet back when I was in middle school, it''s probably over 6 years ago.
      I pity myself back then because I always thought that I have no talent. In our
      family of 5, I have two older brothers, both of them can draw anime very well,
      same goes with my pops. Me, on the other hand, can''t even draw a proper stick
      man. This self-pity continued up until high school.</p>

      <p>High school came and I got myself into a forum about a particular game. The
      forum closed along with the game, but us users of the forum still want to continue
      our conversations. We decided to make a website that we can use. Ever heard
      of Ning? It''s a website where you can create your own social network. At ning
      you can customize your website''s CSS. That''s not just for the administrator,

      <p>Fast forward to the present day. I mentioned that I like reading other people''s
      articles, right? I mentioned all my three hobby at the start of this e-mail.
      I''ve combined all those three hobbies that I have on the internet and the result
      is "Kuru Anime." It''s a website about Anime where users can post blog, drawings,

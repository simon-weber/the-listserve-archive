      \ in my life until recently. The only thing I won was a discarded medal from\
      \ my school sports day that no one wanted and my friend thought it would be\
      \ cool to take it. I still have it until now :) .\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I am from Mauritius,\
      \ a tiny island (48km by 60km) in the middle of the indian ocean. My dad ended\
      \ up here when there was war in China and my grandparents got onto a boat and\
      \ hoped that they would reach a better land and they did.\r\n\r\nMauritius is\
      \ where I was born and after spending 12 years in London, I decided to go back\
      \ home. I earn one fifth of what I used to earn back in London and I don't regret\
      \ it at all because Mauritius is a lovely place to live where you have African\
      \ descendants, Muslims, Indians, white and chinese all living together without\
      \ killing each other off.\r\n\r\nThis is also why I thought that I should give\
      \ the chance for someone else who doesn't have the same luck as I do to pass\
      \ a quick message about what is happening in her own country which is Ukraine.\
      \ I believe that everyone should have the chance to live in peace and not fear.\
      \ \r\n\r\n\"Hi, my name is Nastasia,\r\n\r\nUsually I have a normal job working\
      \ in an advertising agency. But times are not normal.\r\n\r\nYesterday more\
      \ than 70 of my fellow people were shot and killed by the government in Ukraine.\
      \ \r\n\r\nShot in the head, shot in the stomach. Blood coloring the cobble stones\
      \ red at Kyiv's main square, Maidan, where me and my friends have walked, ate\
      \ ice-cream and danced at festivals over the years.\r\n\r\nThe government claims\
      \ that these people were terrorists, yet I know what system they were fighting\
      \ against. A corrupt, brutal and criminal bunch of thugs making the lives of\
      \ ordinary citizens unbearable. \r\n\r\nLet me give you some background information\
      \ if you have the time:\r\n\r\nIn case you don't know what's happening in Ukraine,\
      \ google \"what is happening in Ukraine slideshare\" - there's a link on presentation\
      \ with a summary, last updated 16th Feb. It tells the story about a 3-month-long\
      \ protest in the center of the country's capital against the criminal president's\
      \ dictatorship, robbery and total legal vacuum nationwide, all for the sake\
      \ of president Yanukovich's \"family\" wellbeing (is it normal in your country\
      \ for a president to have a golden toilet bowl? no, seriously, there are photo\
      \ proofs). \r\n\r\nThis protest was peaceful, but turned violent in November,\
      \ after riot police shed blood the first time - against the few students who\
      \ stayed at Maidan at night, singing songs and guarding the tents of protestants\
      \ on the capital's main square.\r\n\r\nSince 16th February (that presentation's\
      \ last update) we had lots of stuff going on. Government's snipers on roofs\
      \ of hotels in the center shooting unarmed peaceful protestants, more than 50\
      \ people dead, many of them with gunshots - in the head, heart and stomach (obviously\
      \ bullets aimed to kill, not to stop). The official version is that this was\
      \ an antiterrorist operation (in a country that never had a terrorist attack?),\
      \ that the protestants are fascists, nationalist radicals who want to overthrow\
      \ the legal government. The information war got to an absurd scale. They say,\
      \ people are drugged and brainwashed. They say, they are financed by Europe\
      \ and US. Road police stops cars who try to bring food, medicines and supplies\
      \ for the protesters.\r\n\r\nYesterday by accident I wrote a Facebook post that\
      \ suddenly got widely shared. Shortly, I joked that if someone doesn't know\
      \ how to help people at Maidan, I can help with advice. Now, just 2 days later,\
      \ afetr I got hundreds of messages \"how can I help?\", I manage a 1000 people\
      \ group on Facebook, coordinating transport, purchase and delivery ofmedical\
      \ supplies, generators for the field hospitals, etc. People send money without\
      \ asking who I am or demanding reports on how money were spent. And there are\
      \ loads of coorinating centers like that. This blind trust and wonderful self-organization\
      \ make me proud of being a Ukrainian, though I have no Ukrainian blood in my\
      \ veins (me parents are Russian and Armenian). \r\n\r\nAccording to the official\
      \ government's version, though, is that I am a Ukrainian nationalist helping\
      \ fascists.\r\n\r\nDear world. Please, find and share the news from my country.\
      \ Help spread the word. Contact your local mass media to cover what's going\

<p>What if I told you that there's something called "selfless selfishness"? (Try saying that three times really fast!) Throughout my college career, I always looked out for the best in others. I helped wherever I could, whether it was buying them lunch or going out of my way for a charity they were involved in. I never expected anything in return no matter what I did, and I thought there was nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>A friend approached me one day and bluntly said, "You're being selfish."</p>
<p>Confused, I asked, "How could helping others out be selfish?"</p>
<p>"Tell me Dat, How does it feel when you help others out?"</p>
<p>I reluctantly replied, "Very good..."</p>
<p>"Then why not give others the chance to get the same feeling?"</p>
<p>Her words put things into perspective; I needed to let others have the opportunity to feel the same great feelings I felt when helping others. Giving and receiving is like breathing. Lungs function properly when air is inhaled (receiving) and exhaled (giving), and a successful person understands the proper balance of "breathing."</p>
<p>Today, I still continue to help others out. But I am aware of giving others the opportunity to contribute. I do this through a company that does motivational speaking, leadership development, and team building for individuals who are searching for success in their career and/or lives. I would love to stay in touch and offer my support and experiences. Follow me on Facebook/Twitter/Website by searching for Nolalight.</p>

      \ So, instead of just driving by, I stopped. Instead of just looking from my\
      \ car, I got out.\r\n\r\nA woman comes out of her house across the street, yelling\

      \ a pillowcase full of laundry.\r\n\r\nI ask her if the man who lives at the\
      \ house is still around. \u201CBob?\u201D she asks. Having not heard another\
      \ person say his name aside from immediate family for thirty years, this familiarity\
      \ makes me pause. \u201CYes.\u201D I respond, trying not to look like someone\
      \ out to do harm. \u201CHe was my stepfather but I haven\u2019t seen him for\
      \ many years.\u201D\r\n\r\nOf course, I don't mention that the last time I saw\

      \ the front door of another neighbor. Tiny dogs bark and are yelled at to be\

      \ she knows Bob and is desperately trying to put together him\u2014old, hardened,\
      \ mentally ill man that he probably is now\u2014with this woman before her.\r\
      \n\r\nShe tells me where to find him. He lives in a hotel now, the house having\
      \ been condemned on account of black mold. I don\u2019t pause. I drive to the\
      \ hotel. I sit outside and look at sad, cheap hotel and think again about how\
      \ much my friends would disapprove. I give my phone number in a note to the\

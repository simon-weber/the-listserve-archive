    body: "Cast:\r\nTIM, the Manager\r\nDENNIS, the Worker\r\nDANIEL, the Unrepentant\
      \ Sycophant\r\n\r\nTIM:                            Dennis, what's the status\
      \ on this job?  It's been in the queue for months.\r\n\r\nDENNIS:          \
      \          Yes it has, Tim.  It's a lower priority.\r\n\r\nTIM:            \
      \                Well, why is it not done?  How long could it possibly take\
      \ you to do this?\r\n\r\nDENNIS:                    Like I started to say, the\
      \ jobs I have been able to complete are all greater priorities.  Are you taking\
      \ them into consideration when you ask?\r\n\r\nTIM:                        \
      \    None of that matters here.  I'm only asking about this job.\r\n\r\nDENNIS:\
      \                    All right then.  It's not done, Tim, because we don't have\
      \ nearly enough staff to keep up with all the work coming in.  You know this.\r\
      \n\r\nTIM:                            Well, this is all Corporate will give\
      \ us.  We have this many manhours to work with.\r\n\r\nDENNIS:             \
      \       Then obviously it's not all going to be tended.  Some things will have\
      \ to go neglected.  The low-priority job before us, for examp\u2014\r\n\r\n\
      TIM:                            Unacceptable.  How do we support our customers\
      \ with the resources we have?\r\n\r\nDENNIS:                    Tim, it's a\
      \ simple matter of arithmetic.  We have this much work coming in.  Each job\
      \ at a bare minimum takes x amount of time.  You might as well ask how to make\
      \ two plus two equal five.\r\n\r\nTIM:                            Well, our\
      \ management dictates it, so how do we go about making two plus two equal five?\r\
      \n\r\nDENNIS:                    <rubs temples>\r\n\r\nTIM:                \
      \            You know, all I'm asking for is a little cooperation.  You talk\
      \ about promotion during your yearly review, I need a little cooperation from\
      \ you.\r\n\r\nDENNIS [patiently]:  Okay Tim.  I am trying to explain the facts\
      \ to you as they are.\r\n\r\nTIM:                            You're a Negative\
      \ Nancy.  Try to think positive.\r\n\r\nDENNIS:                    Doesn't matter\
      \ how you think about it, Tim.  Two plus two will only ever equal four.  Acknowledging\
      \ that reality shouldn't make me a pessimist.\r\n\r\nTIM:                  \
      \          [calls out] Daniel, could you come in here?\r\n\r\nDANIEL:      \
      \              Sure, boss!  What can I do ya for, amigo?  Heh heh heh.\r\n\r\
      \nTIM:                            We're talking about our workload.  How long\
      \ would it take you to complete this job?\r\n\r\nDENNIS:                   \
      \ Tim, as I've said before, we have to priorit\u2014\r\n\r\nDANIEL:        \
      \            This job?  This would take me three seconds.\r\n\r\nTIM:      \
      \                      Dennis here hasn't done the job yet and he's had months!\r\
      \n\r\nDANIEL:                    Heh heh heh.\r\n\r\nDENNIS:               \
      \     Listen!  First of all\u2014\r\n\r\nTIM:                            Daniel,\
      \ I bet you could you make two plus two equal five.\r\n\r\nDANIEL:         \
      \           Well let me think.  What if we stretched the twos?  Wouldn't that\
      \ help?\r\n\r\nTIM:                            See?  Now THAT's the kind of\
      \ innovation we need around here!  We could stretch the numbers!  That would\
      \ almost give us five.\r\n\r\nDENNIS:                    Hey retards!  Forty\
      \ hours still equals forty hours!  The only way to believe otherwise is to willfully\
      \ deny reality.\r\n\r\nTIM:                            I choose to reject your\
      \ negativity.  I like the things I'm hearing from Daniel much more.  Daniel,\
      \ you're hereby promoted above Dennis.\r\n\r\nDENNIS:                    If\
      \ you want to behave responsibly, Tim, you will tell Corporate the truth.  If\
      \ they want five out of us, they'll have to give us more than two plus two.\r\
      \n\r\nTIM:                            Actually they want a hundred.  We really\
      \ have to make two plus two equal one hundred.\r\n\r\nDENNIS:              \
      \      Even one as deluded as you can see that is impossible.\r\n\r\nTIM:  \
      \                          Nope!  How do we make two plus two equal a hundred?\
      \  Daniel?\r\n\r\nDANIEL:                    I think what Dennis is trying to\
      \ say is he thinks it\u2019s impossible.  But what if we morphed the twos into\
      \ sevens?  Won't that get us almost to a hundred?\r\n\r\nTIM:              \
      \              YES!   Daniel you are promoted again!\r\n\r\nDENNIS:        \
      \            I can't participate in this lunacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nFin\r\n\r\nDennis\r\

<p>1. This is my oldest sister&#8217;s favorite joke. Elena, you wonderfully silly adult-person, this is for you:</p>
<p>&#8220;A man is driving his car down a long gravel road. Suddenly, a wide-eyed hare jumps out from behind a bush and our driver is unable to stop before flattening the poor little guy. Distressed, the man begins to cry. A car pulls up behind him and a beautiful woman steps out, pulls a spray can form her purse without a word and sprays the hare from head to toe.The man watches in awe as the hare jumps to it&#8217;s feet, hops a short distance from the car and turns back to wave goodbye. It continues hopping, stopping, turning and waving until it disappears into the distance. The man asks, &#8220;What on Earth did you spray him with?&#8221; and the blonde, reading from the can&#8217;s label replies, &#8220;Salon Hair Spray; brings life back to dead hairs. Adds bounce and permanent wave instantly!&#8221;</p>
<p>2. Talking point: Despite being a lazy, barely-semi-bilingual Canadian who sometimes even struggles with her native English, I think the whole idea of language is pretty neat. I am particularly interested by the way that different languages have words and concepts that we just can&#8217;t quite capture in our English lexicon. For instance, in French &#8220;Tu me manques&#8221; translates loosely to &#8220;I miss you&#8221; but more literally to &#8220;You are missing to me&#8221;. To me that gives the impression that the people you love, whom you miss, are essential components of who you are or who you have become. Sweet, no? All in all I&#8217;m truly lucky to feel that way about my goofy friends and my big, hilarious family.</p>
<p>That being said, here&#8217;s my question for you lovely, diverse worldwide Listservers. You know that feeling when you&#8217;re about to finish a particular thought and suddenly someone else, a friend or a stranger, finishes your sentence better than you possibly could have? It&#8217;s sort of a neat and momentary connection with another human being. Do you have a word for that in your language?</p>
<p>3. Hi guys! Isn&#8217;t this neat. I hope you all are having a nice day. Maybe the sun is shining where you are, or your sandwich is particularly tasty. All I know is, your hair looks great the way you did it today. On this end, I&#8217;m a 21-year-old student living and playing in beautiful Vancouver, BC.<br />Likes; peanut butter and jam pancakes, Calvin and Hobbes comic books, big happy dogs, travels, all of the outdoors everywhere, this band called The National, strangers who smile at you.<br />Dislikes; the sound of other people chewing. Honestly that might be it.</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder where grown-ups are supposed to make other grown-up friends. At the bar? On the street? I&#8217;m not entirely sure. It sure seemed easier when all our moms just organized the playdates for us. Well, I&#8217;d sure love to hear from whoever of you has a moment to write back. I&#8217;ve always wanted a pen pal, and from what I&#8217;ve read you all seem terribly interesting.</p>
<p><br />Cheers.</p>

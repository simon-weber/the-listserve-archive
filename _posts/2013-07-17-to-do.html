<p>I do love a list. My current strategy is to use monthly, weekly and daily lists. These are divided into sections and follow an ever-evolving layout. For example, &#8216;People to Call&#8217; was recently promoted up the page due to lack of progress in this area. A good list must keep you on your toes; get too comfortable with the format and you&#8217;ll start neglecting areas,  assuming their contents. After a leisurely peruse over the &#8216;Tech to Do&#8217; section (this covers digital/online/phone-related tasks) I want to reach the bottom and then... Wham! Ah yes, we&#8217;re out of bin bags.</p>
<p>Lists have to be handwritten. When I think of something to add, I make a note on my phone but will write it down at the first opportunity. Otherwise, how will I cross it off? The Backspace key cannot compete with the cathartic effect of a purposeful, conclusive pen movement. But a paper list can easily be lost and the thought of trying to remember as much as possible, knowing things will be forgotten (something important?) is just horrific. So I take photos of my lists as way of digital backup and peace of mind.</p>
<p>My dad has always been a list-man too. Once, during a busy Sunday afternoon of him getting-things-done, my auntie turned up unannounced. Dad was briefly flustered until he&#8217;d popped over to his notepad and written something down. My auntie Hillary, having spotted this, went to have a look and was aghast to discover her brother had just given her a fifteen-minute time slot alongside the words, &#8220;Chat to Hil&#8221;.</p>
<p>Does this list-writing result in me getting more things done? No. But at least I can be sure of what I haven&#8217;t.</p>
<p>&#8220;Write Listserve email&#8221;, about to be crossed off.</p>

      \ the case today.\r\n\r\nCar: It\u2019s quite awesome to have a car, to be able\
      \ to go where you want and when you want. The problem is that most of the time\
      \ you\u2019re just using the car as a temporary cure to your own laziness, going\
      \ to the store or to work or somewhere else. Most people live where there\u2019\
      s adequate public transportation. This is an inexcusable burden on the local\
      \ environment. If I need a car for something specific, I can borrow or rent\
      \ one. My bike is also an excellent way of transportation, with the added value\

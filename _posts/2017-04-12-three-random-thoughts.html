      <p>This week I went to an author''s reading by Jennifer Finney Boylan. We sat
      in the pews in the church at Bryn Mawr listening while she read three stories
      from her writing. Somehow, even though it wasn''t religious, it seemed fitting
      for her to read to us from the pulpit. Maybe any words that are true, sincere,
      and personal belong there.</p>

      <p>There''s a man who sometimes wanders the streets in my neighborhood, shouting
      "Blat! Blat! Blat!" and pointing dramatically at the horizon. Most people pointedly
      ignore him, some people seem uncomfortable, and I''ve even heard a few people
      angrily yell back at him. I don''t know whether I''m more curious about the
      feeling he''s expressing or by the feelings everyone else are trying not to.</p>

      <p>I think stories about the particular are at least as important to us as theories
      of everything. The world might be a huge, connected whole, but I can only ever
      start to grasp it through specific things. Share your stories with others, especially
      the small ones.</p>

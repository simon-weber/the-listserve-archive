  body: "hi everyone\r\n\r\ni'm a huge fan of the band Fugazi. in April 2002 they\
    \ played two nights at my school. i had the privilege of editing the video footage\
    \ from the first show this past spring, 10 years to the month. you can find it\
    \ if you search \"Fugazi Live Massachusetts College of Art 2002\". i'm working\
    \ on editing the second night (4/20/02), but i'm missing about 30 minutes of footage.\
    \ were you there videotaping? do you know someone who might have footage? i would\
    \ love to get in touch with anyone who might have video of that night so the documentation\
    \ can be complete. thanks for any leads.\r\n\r\none more thing. my partner and\
    \ i moved from boston > nyc > sf > luray, virginia, a rural town about 90 minutes\
    \ from washington, dc. if you ever have the chance to move to a rural area, i\
    \ highly recommend it. i love spending time in urban areas, but we've been able\
    \ to afford a house with a few acres here, something that was impossible in the\
    \ city. i drive down the road to our post office, which is the size of a garden\
    \ shed, and look out at huge fields with cows, old farmhouses and 360 degrees\
    \ of mountains. strangers driving in the opposite direction wave when your cars\
    \ pass. it's lovely, but we need more young people. lots of rural areas have fast\
    \ internet, good coffee, lots of land, affordable houses.\r\n\r\nthanks for listening.\
    \ hope to hear from you.\r\n\r\n\r\nRyanne Hodson\t\r\nryanne.hodson@gmail.com\t\

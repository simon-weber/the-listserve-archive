<p>Last year I watched a TED talk about lollipops (go ahead and watch it) and the impact you can have one someone&#8217;s life without even knowing it. I&#8217;ve found that a lot of people, myself included, are pretty terrible at expressing gratitude, at letting people know how important they are or how they have helped you to grow. Maybe it&#8217;s because we don&#8217;t realize the effect they&#8217;ve had until long after the interaction.</p>
<p>As a part of my job, I organize a staff training program including a safety and security training. Among engaging powerpoints, indoor drills, and one pretty memorable outdoor activity, we also make sure that every person has had the hands on experience of using a fire extinguisher* - the idea is that you have to actually do something to feel comfortable doing it. I feel the same way about expressing gratitude, praise, feedback and more. You have to get in the practice of doing it &#8211; and the more you do &#8211; the more natural it is.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll it started &#8211; &#8220;Thank you&#8221;</p>
<p>To the family I was born to and have found over the years for inspiring me to do better, to learn more, to take risks, to trust, to explore.</p>
<p>To the friends I have lost touch with &#8211; there is a certain comfort in knowing that you pop in and out of my memories, that one day we&#8217;ll reconnect and it will be like no time has passed at all &#8230; or a great deal of time and still we&#8217;ll reminisce with joy.</p>
<p>To the friends I have lost for helping me to see how I&#8217;ve grown, where I&#8217;ve come from, teaching me to prioritize and make hard choices.</p>
<p>To my supervisors in work over the years for giving me so many opportunities to get better, experience different styles, learn, and develop over time. For trusting me.</p>
<p>To my mentors, assigned, found, stumbled upon (and those of you who just don&#8217;t know how much I look up to you) for taking the time to invest in me and my success &#8211; for learning from me and giving to me, for challenging and pushing, and helping me to fly.</p>
<p>To the people I&#8217;ve worked with in so many different jobs for collaboration, inspiration, funny videos, teaching your skills and making work seem like fun.</p>
<p>And to the people who have worked for me for helping me to grow, offering your knowledge and perspective, and understanding that we are all working with the best intentions.</p>
<p>This is vague &#8211; I know. I&#8217;ll try to be better at acknowledging these realizations as they occur. I only encourage you to do the same. Thank someone, tell them how they influenced you, how they changed you.</p>
<p>There were other things I imagined I would want to email to all of you about... they included:</p>
<p>The Little Prince (please read it... again)</p>
<p>Sarah Kay (amazing spoken word)</p>
<p>Travel (do it...it's good for the soul)</p>
<p>Cooking or recipes or something (but there's pinterest, right?)</p>
<p>Social Media, Networking, and Connections (It's a little overwhelming really)</p>
<p>Summer Camp (what an incredible experience for kids to learn how to be kids&#8230; good, independent, kind, adventurous, filled with wonder kids)</p>

<p>* Oh, and really&#8230; if you haven&#8217;t ever used a fire extinguisher &#8211; try it in an empty parking lot once before you need to in a real emergency.</p>

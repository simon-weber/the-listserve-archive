    body: "I live in a world of go. Go forth, go on, go in, go for it. It\u2019s this\
      \ constant go that gives me speed and strength. It\u2019s also this go that\
      \ gives me impatience, and a desperate need to discover the world at a rapid\
      \ pace. At 31, I\u2019m still learning, breaking, bending, growing and sharpening.\
      \ But here are the greatest lessons I have learned along the way.\r\n\r\n1.\
      \ Attack every day with vengeance - a vengeance to inspire, both others and\
      \ yourself, and a vengeance to do better than your best. To some, this vengeance\
      \ can seem harsh, and well, it is. And if it seems all too serious, that\u2019\
      s because it is. The energy I put out into the world, the heart I put into my\
      \ work, the lengths I take to inspire and learn from others, is no laughing\
      \ matter, because I have made a choice for every moment to matter.\r\n\r\n2.\
      \ Passion is one of the most powerful tools we have - because taking risks requires\
      \ heart, and it\u2019s with this heart that I have fought to achieve my goals,\
      \ and conquer them with fury. Whether it\u2019s hiking in Nepal or building\
      \ a kickass team, I bring a lot of energy and passion to my life and work. By\
      \ being inspired, you will inspire others.\r\n\r\n3. Not all connections are\
      \ created equal - in life, there are residents, and visitors. All those that\
      \ come into my world serve a purpose. I cherish them for who they are, the gifts\
      \ they bring and the lessons they leave me with. I\u2019ve learned not only\
      \ to say goodbye, but that how I say goodbye is in my power. Be thankful for\
      \ those who are simply passing through. It will provide you with peace.\r\n\r\
      \n4. Turn poison into medicine - the greatest challenges offer the greatest\
      \ gifts. It\u2019s only through the toughest of moments that we learn and truly\
      \ expand. Dark days are inevitable, but how you respond to them is a choice.\
      \ Approach each experience as a chance to challenge your beliefs and strengthen\
      \ your values and courage. In such strength, you will realize that you are unstoppable.\r\
      \n\r\n5. Life is nonlinear - there is no such thing as work-life balance. I\
      \ believe in building a life you love, inclusive of family, friends, work and\
      \ travel. Live life fluidly, and allow all of your passions to coexist.\r\n\r\
      \n6. Build a bird\u2019s eye view - in time, I\u2019ve developed a quiet confidence\
      \ and calm in both my own acceptance and ownerships of self. I\u2019ve grown\
      \ to be more mindful about who I am and what I do. Every day, I lean into my\
      \ strengths, and proactively work on areas for growth. There\u2019s a lot of\
      \ power that comes from knowing who you are and being able to see yourself from\
      \ 30,000 feet without judgment.\r\n\r\n7. Be fearless, and take risks - going\
      \ after what you want is an art form, and being fearless is a gift \u2014 both\
      \ are attainable and accessible if you allow it. It\u2019s about standing your\
      \ ground, and fighting for what you believe to be true; only questioning yourself\
      \ in hopes to learn and come back with a better game plan; only wondering if\
      \ you can handle it, in order to handle it better. These are the pillars that\
      \ I build my life on. The ones that push me in the direction of discovery: ready,\
      \ set and fearless.\r\n\r\n\u201CAnd, when you want something, all the universe\

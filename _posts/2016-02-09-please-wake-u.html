    body: "A little girl falls in Central Park; she doesn\u2019t move or get up. She\
      \ doesn\u2019t even make a sound. Her mother and father are down on their knees,\
      \ trying to rouse her. Her chest rises and falls with breath, but her eyes aren\u2019\
      t opening. The parents exchange frantic looks. The passers-by don\u2019t notice\
      \ at first.\r\nThat\u2019s when a bird hits the snowbank next to me with a thud.\r\
      \nI look back up to see the father\u2019s shoulders go limp as he lets out a\
      \ yawn. He blinks repeatedly, trying to keep his eyes open, but weariness wins\
      \ out. He slumps to his side, eyes closed. The mother looks around, crying for\
      \ help. Some bystanders start to look her way just in time to see her slump\
      \ to the snowy earth as well.\r\nMore people drop. Some panic, but those are\
      \ the next to go. I stay calm because I need to be. Whatever is going on, I\
      \ must stay on my feet long enough to find my husband, Edgar, and daughter,\
      \ Michelle.\r\nWe planned to meet at the big fountain by all the paddleboats.\
      \ It\u2019s a 10 minute walk, but if I run, I can get there in 5.\r\nI take\
      \ a path into the woods. I\u2019m most of the way through when I see a figure\
      \ in a black longcoat. Their back is to me.\r\n\u201CYeah,\u201D the figure\
      \ says in a woman\u2019s voice. \u201CEveryone\u2019s dropping. We apparently\
      \ got one immune in the area. I\u2019ll deal with them.\u201D\r\nIs she talking\
      \ about me? I have to get past her somehow. The Fountain is just beyond.\r\n\
      I look to my left. Sparse trees. Little refuge. To my right, the woods slope\
      \ downward into a clearing right by the Fountain. I can get by her unseen if\
      \ I move fast enough. As the woman starts to turn around, I vault to the right,\
      \ tucking and rolling down the hillside.\r\nAt the bottom, I jump to my feet\
      \ and make a beeline for the Fountain. Bodies are everywhere. But I see one\
      \ figure still standing. Michelle. Laying next to her is the dozing body of\

      \ she cries.\r\n\u201CI\u2019m so glad I found you, babe,\u201D I say, clutching\
      \ her tight.\r\nThat\u2019s when I yawn.\r\n-One- immune. Oh god.\r\nI give\
      \ her a sad look. My eyelids grow heavy. It\u2019s all she needs to see.\r\n\
      \u201CI\u2019m so sorry,\u201D I say. My cheeks are wet. \u201CI failed you.\u201D\
      \r\n\u201CMom, you\u2019ve never failed me.\u201D She\u2019s crying too. \u201C\
      I just wish I didn\u2019t have to be alone.\u201D\r\nI hug her close one last\
      \ time. \u201CBabe, you\u2019re never alone.,\u201D Another yawn. Need to hurry.\
      \ \u201CI need you to be strong. Some bad people are looking for you. You ha-\u201D\

      \ wouldn\u2019t let me chew. I\u2019d wake up in the middle of the night and\
      \ need to take a handful of tylenol and antacids just to get back to sleep for\
      \ an hour. I had to map out where every bathroom in the world was and prayed\
      \ they were clean. All of this, out of the blue.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m lucky. I\u2019\
      ve been able to beat the disease back into remission, but it has given me this\
      \ sense that I\u2019m always on borrowed time until it comes back. The little\
      \ bastard is always in the back of my head. A very personal reminder of my own\
      \ mortality and what is really important.\r\n\r\nSometimes a high quality of\
      \ life (whatever that means to you) is more significant than making a splash.\
      \ I have no interest in disrupting the world at 41. Unlike twenty years ago,\
      \ I don\u2019t have anything important to say or write. No grand ideas. I\u2019\
      ve discovered what\u2019s important: time with my son, a small collection of\
      \ lifelong friends I can count on one hand, a beautiful and loving wife that\
      \ I count among those friends, health insurance, a good book, a good meal, seeing\
      \ new places. I\u2019ve discovered yoga and think, despite my best efforts,\
      \ it\u2019s changing my life and who I am for the better.\r\n\r\nTake from that\
      \ what you will\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\nSome recommendations:\r\nBooks\r\nStretch -\

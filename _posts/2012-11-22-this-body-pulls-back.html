    body: "This body of mine pulls back, the body that towers six feet, sees from\
      \ a higher vantage point, with enormous arms to reach that which others cannot,\
      \ arms to connect me to the iron that I love so much. Long, strong legs with\
      \ thighs that rub, but if they were smaller legs I would not pull the weight,\
      \ weight that slowly climbs until it reaches these gorgeously large and strong\
      \ thighs, held by the arms that I use to hug and shove. And my stomach, and\
      \ sides, and back- all of these things, the perfect size, holding those arms\
      \ and legs together, connecting and shoring up, big because they have to be\
      \ bulwarks against the iron that threatens to pull me down. \r\n\r\nTwenty nine\
      \ years of hating this body and believing all of the liars that kept telling\
      \ me to reject my body, wanting to pull me down just like the iron tries to\
      \ pull me down. But now this big, tall, strong body of mine says no, and PULLS\
      \ BACK. This body doesn't leave weight on the floor. This body doesn't shy away\
      \ from building more muscle, packing it on like slabs of beef, engorging my\
      \ limbs till they burst through shirts, split seams in dresses, make the earth\
      \ tremble when I walk. I build muscle to pull back; bigger every day, until\
      \ one day I will pull the whole world.\r\n\r\n\r\nDawn\r\nF/29/Weightlifter\r\

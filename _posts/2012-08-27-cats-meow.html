<p>Here is a small fact:</p>
<p>You are going to die.</p>
<p>-The Book Thief, Markus Zusak</p>
<p><br />Sorry if that abrupt introduction startled you; I had to get your attention somehow, you know. One day I woke up and discovered the inevitability of certain death, and that frightened me to no end. I began to feel like my time was running out. I felt helpless. But then I realized that worrying over this wouldn't change anything, and I decided to enjoy my life, however short, instead.</p>
<p>Many people get caught up in the hustle and bustle of working for a far away future and forget to be happy.</p>
<p>So take a step back.</p>
<p>Set aside that paperwork and drive to a nearby park.</p>
<p>Meditate.</p>
<p>Write.</p>
<p>Learn how to salsa.</p>
<p>Go on a scavenger hunt for groovy socks.</p>
<p>Adopt a cat&#8230; or three.</p>
<p>Try to devote a mere 24 hours of your life to you and your happiness, cause let&#8217;s face it;</p>
<p>Someday we&#8217;re all going to fade into oblivion.</p>
<p>Every last memory of us will be erased from reality.</p>
<p>So stop worrying over the petty grudges and problems of today and start being happy instead. :)</p>

      <p>Sorry for this disruption in regularly scheduled Listserving, but we need
      your help.</p>

      <p>Every Listserve winner receives a message telling them they''ve won. It outlines
      the guidelines and some tips to writing a good email. But we wrote that email
      before we even had 100 people on the list &#8212; and we want to mix things
      up. So it''s time to re-write it.</p>

      <p>This is where you come in.</p>

      <p>Go to j.mp/listservetips and give us a suggestion you want us to pass along
      to future winners. We''ll rotate in your tips in various winner emails.</p>

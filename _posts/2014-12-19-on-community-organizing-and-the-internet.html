      \ It was the first time digital technology played a major role in a campaign\
      \ and they knew it was the future of politics.\r\n\r\nThey also knew there was\
      \ a long road ahead. They founded a scrappy organization, the New Organizing\
      \ Institute, to define, train and recruit new organizers who could continue\

      \ to spread the word.\r\n\r\nThis weekend in Washington, DC that conference\
      \ is happening again. It\u2019s grown from a gathering that filled a couple\

      \ together more than a thousand progressive organizers from across the US and\
      \ the world.\r\n\r\nBut it\u2019s more than the size of the event that has changed.\r\
      \n\r\nI\u2019ve worked in this space all that time. When I began, just after\
      \ the 2004 elections, it was in its infancy. Few people understood what we did\
      \ or why we did it. Most people thought if you worked on the Internet team you\
      \ would fix their computer. We regularly heard people say they \u201Cdidn\u2019\
      t do the Internet.\u201D\r\n\r\nYet, we knew what it would be. We knew the power\
      \ of the Internet had the ability to influence every single aspect of the campaigns\
      \ we worked on. We know it was a tool for change. A way to bring people together.\
      \ To find common ground. To build power. To make the world a better place.\r\
      \n\r\nWe also knew we couldn\u2019t do it alone. We needed allies. We needed\
      \ more of us. We needed the powers-that-be who controlled the budgets and everything\
      \ else to give a damn and pay attention.\r\n\r\nRootscamp was where we came\
      \ to figure out how to make that happen.\r\n\r\nYesterday I walked the halls\
      \ of the Rootscamp2014 that buzzed with energy. There were happy reunions. The\
      \ opportunity to run into a colleague you worked alongside years back and hadn\u2019\
      t seen lately. Hugs from friends whose lives had taken them away from DC. But\
      \ most striking was I saw more faces I didn\u2019t recognize than those that\
      \ I did. I was struck by how far we\u2019d come. How the community we had hoped\
      \ to create had become a reality. How that collective work had blossomed into\
      \ a community that was beautifully diverse and inclusive.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s given\
      \ careers to people who had passion and purpose. It\u2019s been a launching\
      \ pad for companies, nonprofits and campaigns and individuals that work to elect\
      \ our representatives from school board to president, stop climate change, end\
      \ gun violence, increase women\u2019s equality, give a voice to the voiceless,\
      \ and much more. It\u2019s where we want to solve big problems and answer hard\
      \ questions. It\u2019s a place where we know we are more powerful when we do\
      \ that together.\r\n\r\nOf course, we still have work to do. We continue to\
      \ strive for more. But we have a place where that happens \u2013 a community\
      \ where we learn from each other and challenge ourselves to be and do better.\r\
      \n\r\nIf you\u2019ve ever wondered about doing this type of work. if you\u2019\
      ve wanted a way in, I encourage you to google the New Organizing Institute.\
      \ You could be walking the halls next year alongside us, full of energy and\
      \ empowered to create change. That would be a beautiful thing.\r\n\r\nI\u2019\

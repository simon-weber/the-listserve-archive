    \ activity I\u2019m doing is meaningful to me and why. I\u2019ve spent so much\
    \ time in my life on passive activities with no value to me. Watching reruns of\
    \ the Fresh Prince, reading Buzzfeed lists of the 17 Kittens Most Likely to Run\

    \ Water is probably more important.\r\n\r\nOkay. Sorry, but while we\u2019re on\
    \ the subject of water, I\u2019m going to make a recommendation and say I\u2019\
    m pretty sure everybody on this list would enjoy reading David Foster Wallace\u2019\
    s \u201CThis is Water.\u201D It\u2019s really quick and breezy and you can find\
    \ it free online.\r\n\r\nDid you read \u201CThis is Water\u201D? Okay, good. It\u2019\
    s pretty synonymous with my own thoughts on the importance of being conscious\
    \ of the little decisions we all make in life. Which brings me back to my main\
    \ point. While I don\u2019t think I have enough skills or direction to quit my\
    \ aforementioned office job quite yet, I try to spend my free time in ways that\
    \ matter to me. Mostly I play music, record music, read, and write longwinded\
    \ ListServe emails.\r\n\r\nUsing the internet as my guide I\u2019ve gotten alright\
    \ at recording music\u2014I\u2019ve got Pro Tools and all the usual-suspect cheap\
    \ mics\u2014SM57s, MXL 990s\u2014but I\u2019d love to learn in a more formalized\
    \ manner. It seems like kind of a crass request to tack on here, but do you guys\
    \ know anybody who works in a recording studio in Chicago? I was once an intern\
    \ for a well-known TV show so I am an expert at running errands, doing chores,\
    \ and providing unpaid labor in a professional setting.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I\

      \ Thankful for their love, warmth and patience. Thankful for all the people\
      \ who work to make my life enjoyable, in whatever capacity. Thankful that some\
      \ people really do want to make the world a better place.\r\n\r\nFor you reading\
      \ this, it\u2019ll be a few days post-thanksgiving, and you may be in a part\
      \ of the world that has no such tradition. Actually I am a Brit, currently enjoying\
      \ North Carolinian hospitality (and BBQ). Hopefully you can use as a sign to\
      \ give a quiet thank you to anyone in your life you think deserves it.\r\n\r\
      \nThanks to the people at The Listserve for this awesome opportunity. Thanks\
      \ to Mark Frauenfelder at BoingBoing for introducing me to it. Being chosen\
      \ today bolsters my irrational belief in fate. In my head, I know it was random\
      \ that I got selected on Thanksgiving, but in my heart I just can\u2019t quite\
      \ believe that. It seems too lucky. Kismet.\r\n\r\nAudentes Fortuna iuvat. Hopefully\
      \ she\u2019ll favour me. Hopefully she favours all that try. I am about to try\
      \ and embark on a writing career. Will I succeed? Who knows. But I am thankful\
      \ people will love me whether I succeed or not and even if I fail, at least\
      \ I\u2019ll know I gave it a shot. Wish me luck.\r\n\r\nHe who dares, Rodney,\

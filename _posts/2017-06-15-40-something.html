      \ that mismatch doesn\u2019t strengthen my ties with the school. I stopped making\

      \ until all my student loans were paid off. I just made my last payment in February\
      \ . And, where\u2019s that extra money going? Not to the school, sadly. I\u2019\
      m investing in yoga and spinning instead.\r\n\r\nReunions are like going to\

      \ we actually care and lots of harmless conversations. Sometimes there are promises\
      \ of seeing each other again. But we all go our separate ways and forget. I\
      \ tend to think that if there\u2019s anyone I would\u2019ve cared to stay in\
      \ touch with, I already do. I sound like the least friendly person but I just\
      \ enjoy more intimate smaller circles of friends. Networking and parties are\
      \ not really my thing. (I\u2019m going to laugh at all this when I probably\

      \ a little break from the career trajectory I was on. I had the option to work\
      \ part time from home and be home for the kids. Being a mom is the hardest and\
      \ yet the most rewarding job. Their smiles, hugs, conversations, achievements\
      \ fill my heart.  I dream and think about how I want to be in leadership roles\
      \ again at work.  Work in an organization (right now, my work is freelancing\
      \ so it gets a bit lonesome) sounds thrilling! The reason is working with your\
      \ own children can be maddening! Right now, I\u2019m dealing with kids who won\u2019\
      t respond to anything I say. I know work has its issues too but it sure feels\
      \ like I\u2019d have more control than I have with my own children. (Thing about\
      \ freelancing though I don\u2019t miss the adult drama at work! How much time\
      \ gets wasted on misjudged feelings, misunderstandings, unmet expectations,\
      \ and more!)\r\n\r\nWhat I want most of all in the mom gig is to have raised\
      \ happy, confident, independent-thinking children. It would be my greatest accomplishment\
      \ and my only wish to have healthy relationships with my children.  Curious\
      \ to hear from parents and children on what they appreciated most or would never\

      \ and such. My kids are in Kinder and preschool \u2013 I\u2019m out of the crazy\
      \ baby years and loving this mode before attitudes and opinions and rolling\

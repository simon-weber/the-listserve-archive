<p>I wrote this years ago, on my way to boot camp. If you enjoy, feel free to respond. 600 words is hard.</p>
<p><br />I look behind me and there is light. It shines with a great brightness.  I look ahead of me and see: Nothing.  I see darkness and despair, the unknown.  How silly I must look to anyone watching, up here standing between my past and my future.  The bright security of my past illuminates me from behind, making me visible to all I am yet to see.<br />I turn and face the brightness.  How easy it would be to walk back there and stay where I am.  I look over my shoulder and shiver.  Surely the darkened path is steep, uneven and cluttered with debris that will make me fall.  I should just go back down the path I know.  I know it is level and clear.<br />I start down the lighted trail, going back to smiling faces.  First the faces of those I know, faces of love.  The trail is steady and clear.  My past quietly whispers that I should return to the new path.<br />Then I understand.  These are the people I would have, could have, should have met, had I risked the dark, the unknown.  Yet still I walk forward, further on the lighted path. The people of my past and missed future look on with concern, but still they let me continue on.<br />Suddenly, I stumble.  What did I trip over?  There was nothing in the trail last time I was here.  I look, and see that I tripped over my desire to change; it lies here broken and defeated.  I have killed it. But WAIT, it still moves.  I have a chance to revive it.<br />I know what I must do.  I must take it back the other way, into the unknown. I look to the darkness, back the other way. I can&#8217;t go there. I continue in the light.<br />In front of me there is a wall, it wasn&#8217;t there before.  I look at the wall, and recognize it immediately.  It is a wall of my disappointment.  Disappointment in myself.  I can go around it, but eventually it will appear again.<br />I look back again, at the future I turned away from.  It seems a little brighter, grey now, not black, with light in the distance.  That light; hope, lets me know that the end of the path will bright.<br />I walk toward the grey, and pick up my desire for change.  I look back on my familiar path.  Sure, it was a nice path, but I am done with it now.  Clearly I cannot go back that way.  I must continue on.<br />So here I am.  At the edge again, with the light at my back and the unknown trail ahead.  In my hands is the desire to change. I hesitate.. Is this my last chance to turn back?  No, but I am going to keep going on the unfamiliar path.  How can I turn back and kill a part of me?<br />I take that first step forward, and the path ahead seems to lighten, just a bit.  I tell myself not to look back, and take another step. The light brightens more.<br />My desire for change has been revived, and become a part of me.  I know what is behind me, but ahead of me lay new challenges and excitement.  I will go forward, knowing that I am not leaving my old path.<br />So to my old path, goodbye for now.  To my new path: Ready or not Here I Come!</p>

    body: "On a late summer day in 2009, I reported for my first shift as a hotline\
      \ counselor at a tenants' rights organization in Chicago.  I had volunteered\
      \ to answer calls from tenants who were uncertain about their rights, many of\
      \ whom were on the brink of losing their homes.\r\n\r\nMy first caller was a\
      \ single mother of two who lived paycheck to paycheck and had been living in\
      \ conditions most of us couldn't imagine.  Her bathroom ceiling was leaking\
      \ and covered with mold, until one day it started to fall down.  A chunk of\
      \ plaster narrowly missed her two-year-old daughter in the bathtub.  She called\
      \ her landlord, who did nothing.  Then, her power went out.  The landlord hadn't\
      \ paid the electric bill, and he ignored her calls.  To get her lights back\
      \ on, the tenant joined together with her neighbors to pay the massive past-due\
      \ electric bill, and deducted the cost from her rent.\r\n\r\nIt was then that\
      \ the landlord acted.  Not to make repairs, but to promptly bring the tenant\
      \ to \"\"eviction court\"\" for the rent she withheld.  Suddenly, this tenant,\
      \ who had already endured so much, was at risk of losing everything:  the roof\
      \ over her head; the only home she could afford.  The landlord, meanwhile, faced\
      \ virtually no punishment for abandoning his tenants.  At the center of this\
      \ tenant's crisis is the fact that she would likely have to go to court without\
      \ the help of a lawyer.  Studies have shown that roughly 98% of landlords have\
      \ lawyers in housing court, while in many cities, fewer than 5% of tenants have\
      \ counsel, making it nearly impossible to assert their rights.\r\n\r\nTo this\
      \ day, I don't know if the tenant got a lawyer, whether she won her eviction\
      \ case, or whether her landlord ever fixed the gaping hole in her ceiling. \
      \ I know so little about her, yet she impacted my life in such powerful ways.\
      \  Her story motivated me to keep volunteering on the hotline, and inspired\
      \ me to become a tenants' rights lawyer so that people like her have a fighting\
      \ chance against abusive landlords.\r\n\r\nToday, I'm a lawyer at a nonprofit\
      \ in Brooklyn, representing tenants against landlords who are harassing them,\
      \ discriminating against them, and refusing to make repairs.  The balance of\
      \ power between tenants and landlords is as infuriating as ever, and sometimes\
      \ I'm left feeling hopeless.  A tenant who misses just one rent payment can\
      \ be at the brink of losing her home in less than a month.  But when a landlord\
      \ breaks his end of the bargain, it often takes years for tenants to get justice---if\
      \ they ever do.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, I'm on the upside of another great\
      \ imbalance.  When I'm talking to a tenant living in unlivable conditions, I\
      \ think of my own cozy apartment and sing Brett Dennen lyrics in my head:  \"\
      \"In a world of suffering, why should I be so blessed?\"\"  There is no answer\

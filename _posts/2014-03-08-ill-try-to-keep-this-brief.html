    body: "Hey everyone! I was shocked when I got the \"you won\" email. With over\
      \ 25,000 of us, I never really thought I'd be chosen.\r\n\r\nSome things I think\
      \ everyone should know/do in life:\r\n\r\n1) Do theater!\r\nI can't stress this\
      \ enough. I started doing musical theater late (in my early 20s), and it also\
      \ happened to be one of the worst times in my life. I had just lost a younger\
      \ brother during my first show. I got into theater because of my love of music\
      \ and singing. I wasn't a very confident person during those years, but my voice\
      \ teacher insisted I audition for a show. So I did, and was cast in \"West Side\
      \ Story\" and it literally changed my life. I became more confident in myself,\
      \ I got out of my depression, and I met some of the most amazing people i'd\
      \ ever meet. I met most of my lifelong friends in theater. There was something\
      \ uplifting about being around so many people that have the same love and passion\
      \ for the arts as I did. Theater was my therapy. I performed for almost 10 years\
      \ in the San Francisco bay area and fit in a show whenever I can (I am now a\
      \ self employed stay at home dad, so making it to rehearsals is tough these\
      \ days. Haha).\r\n\r\n\r\n3) Suicide sucks\r\nThis one is going to get a bit\
      \ personal. I survived suicide twice. Now, you're probably thinking I was the\
      \ one that attempted suicide... You're wrong though. My father committed suicide\
      \ when I was a baby, and my step father committed suicide when I was 14. Being\
      \ someone that had to pick up the pieces emotionally was devastating. I spent\
      \ most of my childhood trying to keep myself and my family intact. Because of\
      \ their selfish choice, I lost out on my childhood and my teen years. I'm not\
      \ going to go too into detail though, it's pretty personal. I just want all\
      \ of you that have been through the same thing to know, that you are not alone.\
      \ I am in my mid 30s and still trying to recover from the losses I've had in\
      \ my life. You can never recover 100% when someone you love takes their own\
      \ life.\r\n\r\n4) Star Trek is not for nerds/geeks\r\nStar trek was/is one of\
      \ the most well written shows ever created. It transcends generations. It is\
      \ so forward thinking and amazing everyone should watch it. From the technology,\
      \ the thought of a moneyless way of living, and the integration of all species,\
      \ it was/is way ahead of its time. Gene Roddenberry created an amazing world\
      \ within Star Trek, and I for one am thrilled that they re imagined it! The\
      \ new films are a great mix of action and star trek lore. My favorite series\
      \ is TNG and I hope they someday re imagine it as well\r\n\r\nLastly, I want\
      \ to thank my old Apple co-worker Tim Kretchmer for turning me on to \"The Serve\"\
      . I have really enjoyed reading everyone else\u2019s messages. I hope some of\
      \ you can take something positive away from my message.\r\n\r\nIf any of you\
      \ are in the San Francisco bay area, look me up. I do photography, video, digital\
      \ audio, event DJing, graphic design, and build custom \"Hackintosh\" computers\
      \ (now that I no longer work for Apple). I love making new contacts and meeting\
      \ new people. Feel free to drop me a line anytime. My website is the same as\

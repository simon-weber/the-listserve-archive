    body: "I gradually ramped up over the course of about 3 hours with 30mg MXE sublingual,\

      \ 40mg MXE sublingual. Up until about 20 minutes after the final dose, I had\
      \ been sitting up with dim lights on reading a short story collection (Jeff\
      \ VanderMeer - who, by the way, produces some truly surreal fiction that can\
      \ be incredible to experience with disassociatives).Something struck me as funny\
      \ and I put the book away. I started to think about the \"cosmic joke,\" which\
      \ in my understanding is that we are each a living paradox, unable to comprehend\
      \ the meaning of existence but capable of recognizing that fact. I then perceived\
      \ a playful invisible presence in the room that seemed to be joyfully tickling\
      \ my sense of irony and humor and pleasantly surprised that I was aware of it.\
      \ I started to laugh and felt comforted and at peace.\r\n\r\nAt that point I\
      \ turned off the lights, lay down, and put in my ear buds with Yo La Tengo's\
      \ instrumental album \"Sounds of the Sounds of Science.\" This synergized nicely\
      \ and lulled me into a trance. I was starting to truly \"hole\" for the first\
      \ time, feeling like I was sinking into a deep pit and no longer present in\
      \ the here-and-now. Serious time dilation set in. At this point a grating track\
      \ came on and I emerged long enough to switch to Mitski's \"Bury Me At Makeout\
      \ Creek.\" I started to experience massive waves of magnified emotional content\
      \ from each lyric, phasing in and out between self-awareness and just *being*\
      \ the music itself. The track \"I Don't Smoke\" came on, and when the following\
      \ lyrics played:\r\n\r\n\"If you need to be mean be mean to me / I can take\
      \ it and put it inside of me / if your hands need to break more than trinkets\
      \ in your room / you can lean on my arm as you break my heart\"\r\n\r\n... I\
      \ knew it was a/the deity speaking directly to me, offering to accept, validate,\
      \ and transform every ounce of sorrow I have ever experienced. I turned off\
      \ the music and was quiet for a little while, then I felt an incredibly massive\
      \ wave of gratitude, acceptance, and worship. I am naturally skeptical and have\
      \ been agnostic as long as I've been able to reason about it. It was like I\
      \ suddenly became religious, like I experienced the exact inverse of my normal\
      \ state - I knew and was embraced by a very specific embodiment of THE deity.\
      \ I started sobbing and thanking god for revealing itself to me, for choosing\
      \ to grant me a moment of relief from the uncertainty of seeking truth in this\
      \ life.\r\n\r\nI slowly re-connected with the present and time began to pass\
      \ at a normal pace.\r\n\r\nAt the peak of this experience, I understood it to\

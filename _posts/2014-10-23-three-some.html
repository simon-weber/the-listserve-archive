      <p>It&#8217;s a true story. Maybe. But more importantly, I hope it grabbed your
      attention or made you laugh. This timeless joke reminds me of an old school
      Mark Twain quote:</p>

      <p>&#8220;Life is short, break the rules, forgive quickly, kiss slowly, love
      truly, laugh uncontrollably, and never regret anything that made you smile.&#8221;</p>

      <p>I think there&#8217;s more to the quote, but you get the gist of it. Life
      is too short. If you can&#8217;t find something to laugh about every day, try
      harder. It&#8217;s out there. Don''t take things so seriously. There''s more
      to life than work. Find a healthy balance, and spend more time with your friends
      and family, and laugh with them. Uncontrollably. That''s what ultimately matters
      in the long haul.</p>

      <p>Shoot me an email back describing something that makes you laugh everyday
      and how you find a healthy work/life balance. Mine is slipping and could use
      some fresh new perspective and ideas. Or just say hello and where you''re from.
      Would love to hear from you.</p>

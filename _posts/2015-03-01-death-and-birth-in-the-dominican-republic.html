    body: "About four years ago, I sat in a hospital in the Dominican Republic while\
      \ a serene nun quietly delivered the news that my friend\u2019s only son had\
      \ died. For the last three weeks his parents, residents of a slum over an hour\
      \ away, had sat vigil at the hospital. That is to say, his mother didn\u2019\
      t leave her boy\u2019s side, while his father slept on a bench outside at night\
      \ \u2013 only one person was permitted in the hospital room at a time. Their\
      \ son had leukemia - a form of it that comes with a good prognosis here in the\
      \ United States. But without access to proper care or lifesaving bone marrow\
      \ transplants, my friend\u2019s son was swallowed up by the gap that persists\
      \ between rich and poor. I watched as the doctors hurriedly explained that their\
      \ son had died from caca en el sangre (\u201Cpoop in his blood\u201D).  The\
      \ nuns sent them away with a small, ceramic angel to take his place.\r\n\r\n\
      \r\n\r\nI spent the next few weeks in a haze of self-indulgent bitterness; homesick\
      \ and self-loathing and fed-up with the state of the world. I didn\u2019t believe\
      \ in angels, let alone ceramic ones. What else was there to do but sulk?\r\n\
      \r\n\r\n\r\nBut as I stewed, my friends began to make the end of their son\u2019\
      s story the beginning of a new one. They volunteered to become Community Health\
      \ Workers with the organization that had attempted to treat their son. They\
      \ studied how to take blood pressure and read A1C levels. They spent Saturdays\
      \ taking neighbors to doctors\u2019 appointments on their motorcycle, foregoing\
      \ the chance to make some much-needed cash on charging for trips. They spent\
      \ hours sorting medications for field clinics and began leading community health\
      \ groups. They did it all between crying jags and long silent spells. They did\
      \ it in spite of a grief I cannot even fathom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn two weeks,\
      \ my friends are expecting the completely unexpected \u2013 the birth of a baby\
      \ boy whom I\u2019ll be lucky enough to call my godson. They are overjoyed and\
      \ so am I. I don\u2019t know what will happen in my godson\u2019s story or how\
      \ long it will last. But I write this in hopes of one day sharing with him how\
      \ his story began; with two parents who quietly and unassumingly possess the\
      \ strength to overcome their own struggles to do good in this world. And with\
      \ a godmother who is so incredibly grateful to have learned from them. And with\
      \ all of us ready to welcome him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a world that so often fails\
      \ the individuals who are brought into it, I want him to know that he is loved,\
      \ that he is important, and that no matter what, he has someone rooting for\
      \ him. And when he struggles, I want him to know that like his parents, he can\
      \ be so much stronger, smarter, kinder, and more courageous than he ever imagined.\r\
      \n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease consider checking out Health Horizons International in\
      \ the Dominican Republic (hhidr dot org).  My friend now works for them full-time\
      \ and continues to do an amazing job of helping the organization grow. Your\
      \ support can help make the community that my godson will grow up in a safer,\

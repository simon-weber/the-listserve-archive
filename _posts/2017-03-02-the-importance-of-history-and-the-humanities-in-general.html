      \ you to support historians and public history especially. Advocate for a more\

      \ a completely different field and encourage your friends to do the same. Engage\

      \ for their time and hard work. Think about your own field of study historically\u2014\
      when did it evolve and why? Pick up non-fiction history books, especially if\
      \ you have an interest in historical fiction (in books or on TV and film). Get\
      \ the real story, not just the entertaining bits. Submit yourself to an oral\
      \ history, either locally or through organizations like Storycorps, which seek\
      \ to tell the stories of average Americans in the course of their lives. If\
      \ you have children in public school (or even in private school), get involved\
      \ not only in their STEM education (important in our modern technologically\
      \ based world), but find out what they are learning in their history and English\
      \ classes. Demand greater diversity in those courses and help them supplement\
      \ when all they seem to be getting is a parade of dead, white men (though they\
      \ shouldn't be excluded, either). Write your own history, too, and those of\
      \ your family and community. Become an amateur historian and work with professional\
      \ historians to do what you can to preserve the past and give your community,\

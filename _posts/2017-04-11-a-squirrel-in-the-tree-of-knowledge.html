    body: '<p>Dear fellow Listservian,</p>

      <p>My name is Sylvia and I''m a philosopher of science.</p>

      <p>One of my favourite quotes about science comes from Albert Einstein: &#8220;[A]ll
      our science, measured against reality, is primitive and childlike &#8211; and
      yet it is the most precious thing we have.&#8221;</p>

      <p>When I try to communicate what science is, I like to use the following metaphor.</p>

      <p>Science is like a living tree. In the trunk we find theories that have survived
      all previous seasons and each pruning: they have been corroborated by lots of
      evidence and independent tests; they receive a probability extremely close to
      100%. The branches are younger, less well confirmed, but highly probable still.
      The twigs are relatively young and many of them will have to be pruned during
      the following seasons: they will be falsified by further evidence, or simply
      rendered much less probable than a competing branch. Most twigs will never turn
      into the wood that textbooks are made of. But it''s impossible to predict which
      are the ones that will make it: we can only observe how the tree develops and
      prune redundancies when time comes. The multitudes of individual articles that
      appear, day in day out, form the leaves: all of them will fall off, fertilizing
      the soil and feeding the roots of the tree of science. Though short-lived and
      less probable than other structures, they are vital to provide energy for the
      rest of the tree.<br />The tree flourishes best when other organisms live among
      its roots: curiosity and a thirst for cures and practical solutions. But most
      of all, the tree needs water: money for science comes from the environment.
      There are many external influences on the tree. Society is like the weather:
      when it''s sunny with soft rains of Spring, the tree will prosper, but when
      it becomes stormy, entire branches may break off and when there is no rain,
      the tree withers.<br />Never mistake the rustling of the leaves for science:
      it''s ephemeral. Nor mistake the trunk for science: without roots and leaves,

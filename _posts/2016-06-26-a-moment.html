      \ that seemed to open just beyond them. I recognized on her face the sense of\
      \ awe and appreciation that had struck me in my gut the second I walked into\
      \ the space, and with this oddly joyful weight in my stomach, I walked up to\
      \ her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I asked if I could take her picture, and with\
      \ a muted smile, she agreed. I framed the shot on the screen of my iPhone took\
      \ the picture. She told me she had been standing in the same spot for 3 hours\
      \ in awe, and I couldn't help but smile and laugh. I laughed because that was\
      \ the same response I was having to the pure and intentional design that surrounded\
      \ us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   We wandered the space for an hour, talking about\

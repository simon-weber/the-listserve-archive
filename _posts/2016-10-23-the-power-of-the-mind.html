      \ Barnes who, like me, had moved to the East Coast. I thought the next time\
      \ I was in Washington DC I would get in touch, as I had not spoken to her since\
      \ graduation.\r\n\r\nA few months later I found myself in DC and it was a glorious\
      \ day so I decided to walk back to my hotel from my appointment.  I was in Georgetown\
      \ and suddenly remembered that this was where Dee Dee lived, but had not remembered\
      \ to take her information with me and had no way of contacting her.  I remembered\
      \ that I read somewhere that we only use 10% of our brain\u2019s power, so as\
      \ it was a day that anything seemed possible, I decided to test that theory\
      \ and conjure up the unused 90% to see if I could somehow make a connection\
      \ with my old friend.    As I wandered through the streets of Georgetown, I\
      \ concentrated on Dee Dee and pictured her coming out of one of the beautiful\
      \ brownstone buildings as I was passing.  I would say something clever like\
      \ \u201CHi Dee Dee, I was just thinking about you\u201D.  As an alternative,\
      \ in case I was walking on the wrong block, I pictured her driving by and getting\
      \ out of her car to mail a letter.  I thought about her all the way back to\
      \ my hotel.  And at this point, you are probably wondering if she miraculously\
      \ appeared.  Alas, no.  An experiment that did not really work, but it was a\
      \ great walk anyway.\r\n\r\nThe next day, I found myself back at my desk in\
      \ New York. My phone rang and I answered it.  \u201C Hi Maureen, this is Dee\
      \ Dee Barnes\u201D.  My jaw dropped.  To say that I was flabbergasted is an\
      \ understatement.  She was in New York City and wondered if we might have lunch.\
      \  I cancelled other plans and couldn\u2019t wait to tell her my story. Before\
      \ I could get to it, she said she also got the book from the reunion and as\
      \ she comes to New York often made a note to take my information.  As she was\
      \ packing for her trip yesterday, suddenly a vision of me appeared in her head\
      \ and she dropped what she was doing to get my number.  It was the same time\
      \ that I was walking back to the hotel and using all of my brainpower on this\
      \ connection.\r\n\r\nThe other odd thing was that she got directly through to\
      \ me even though I had changed jobs a month before, so the number she initially\
      \ called was not where I worked anymore.  Someone who knew me answered that\
      \ phone and gave her my new number.  Also, my secretary usually answered my\
      \ calls, but she was up getting coffee, so the call came directly to me.  There\
      \ was no doubt that we were meant to talk that day.\r\n\r\nThe experience both\
      \ delighted and frightened me and I realize we all have amazing powers if we\

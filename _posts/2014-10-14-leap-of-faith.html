      \  I wanted a challenge, and I needed a change.  I needed to prove to myself\

      \ and learning.  That\u2019s my challenge to you.  If you\u2019re in your comfort\
      \ zone, living in a bubble, get out of it.  Whether you sell everything you\
      \ own and travel the world, or just move to another city, get out there and\

      \  I wasn\u2019t okay with reaching my glass ceiling at the age of 30.  So,\
      \ I quit.  I packed up everything I own, moving it all into a storage facility\

      \ you ever do.  Each day, week, month, and year, I will get better.\r\n\r\n\
      To be completely open and honest with you, I was terrified to do this.  A little\
      \ over a year ago, I lost my mom after she fought a courageous battle with cancer.\
      \  Just four months after her diagnosis, I lost my best friend.  I didn\u2019\

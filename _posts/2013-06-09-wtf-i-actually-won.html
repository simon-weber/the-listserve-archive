      \ day of the race is definitely no joke. I run a few times a week and never\
      \ feel the high that I felt after crossing the starting line. After about 3\
      \ miles into it I started to realize how amazing this whole thing was. With\
      \ the thousands of people running this and the hundreds cheering along the sidelines\
      \ the entire 13 miles it hit me that this wasn't just something to say I've\
      \ done. If you know me you know this isn't an exaggeration but this definitely\
      \ gave me major goosebumps. Running isn't for everyone but even if you decide\
      \ to walk the whole way I recommend participating in one of these in your lifetime.\
      \ They have them all over the world now and it\u2019s definitely an amazing\
      \ feeling to be part of something like this.\r\n\r\nBecause of the lack of having\
      \ something else inspirational, thought evoking, or just plain interesting to\
      \ share with you guys I figure I would give you a list of the little things\

      \ can add them to their list of little things J\r\n\r\n-         Las Vegas \u2013\
      \ because it\u2019s the adult Disneyworld\r\n\r\n-          Naps \u2013 that\
      \ moment after you wake up from a really really good one\r\n\r\n-          Laughing\
      \ until it hurts or you pee your pants \u2013 pretty sure everyone has this\

      t do it, do it\r\n\r\n-          Sneezing \u2013 never stop someone from sneezing;\
      \ it\u2019s a fact that it\u2019s a 1/8th of an orgasm\r\n\r\n-          Seeing\
      \ a really good movie \u2013 it can make you laugh, cry, or just think about\
      \ life\u2026 either way you can\u2019t deny it\u2019s a good feeling\r\n\r\n\
      -          A good cry \u2013 even though at the time it\u2019s usually because\

      1. Call your parents once a week and tell them you love them. If not your folks,\
      \ call someone you love. Never underestimate the power of your voice expressing\
      \ affection upon someone.\r\n\r\n2. Live below your means and work to save at\
      \ least 20% of your salary. Set up automatic withdrawals to a separate account.\
      \ Maximize your retirement contributions. It is never to late to start saving\
      \ and yes, every penny does count.\r\n\r\n3. Little habits make all the difference\
      \ in life: Stretch & Touch your toes in the shower every day. Brush your teeth.\
      \ Put your fork down between bites.\r\n\r\n4. Do something nice for someone\
      \ once a day. The cumulative effect of random acts of kindness are worth striving\
      \ towards.\r\n\r\n5. Eat less meat, processed foods, and exercise more. Little\
      \ changes will always add up.\r\n\r\n6. Read more - just not on electronic devices.\
      \ There\u2019s beauty in focusing some time to shutting off all distractions\
      \ and reading a book.\r\n\r\n7. Music - Make more music, or listen to more Classical,\
      \ Jazz, and ambient music. All great genres to help meditate.\r\n\r\n8. Never\
      \ stop learning: Learn something new every day. Read something different, draw\
      \ something, cook something new.\r\n\r\n9. Be Optimistic. Before you say or\
      \ do something, think. Take your time, choose your words carefully, and always\
      \ be optimistic. This time will never come again, make it count.\r\n\r\n10.\
      \ Save a life - adopt a pet. You may find that your pet may be the one saving\
      \ your life.\r\n\r\nHope some of these ideals resonate with you all.\r\n\r\n\

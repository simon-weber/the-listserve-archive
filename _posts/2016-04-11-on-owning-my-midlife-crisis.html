    body: "I have been a bit chubby most of my life. As a young adult I wasn't too\

      In 2008, at the age of 32, I became a father. It is a clich\xE9 I know, but\

      \ people in my life I loved above everything else in the world. But ultimately\
      \ I was still at the center of my own life. And once I became a father, that\
      \ little guy became the center of my life. I was bumped to a supporting role,\
      \ and his future became more important than mine.\r\n\r\nThen in 2012, my father\
      \ died. The cause was health related, although it was not something directly\
      \ applicable to me. It still got me thinking about my own mortality. I had not\

      \ I had felt the weight weighing me down for years already. My last physical\
      \ showed some troubling liver values related to obesity. I was eating antacid\
      \ for heartburn. Tying my shoes was a strain, drying my feet after a shower\
      \ even more so. And playing with my kid was exhausting.\r\n\r\nI started worrying\
      \ about my own health, and decided I had to do something. So when January 2013\
      \ came around I started a gym membership. Small sessions of treadmill jogging\
      \ and machine exercises two times a week.\r\n\r\nDuring the next 18 months I\
      \ went from no dietary changes (exercise alone did nothing on the scale) through\
      \ keeping a food diary (choosing healthier alternatives resulted in losing 1\
      \ kilo a month) to a 1000 calorie a day deficit (losing 1 kilo a week). My wonderful\
      \ wife joined me for the last part.\r\n\r\nThe spring of 2014 a friend of mine\
      \ convinced me to sign up for a local series of outdoor running races. I never\
      \ thought I had a competitive streak, but I was hooked from the first run! That\
      \ summer I finished my first 10k at 1:07:57 and my weight leveled out around\
      \ 96 kilos (211 pounds).\r\n\r\nWhen the fall came I booked a personal trainer\
      \ to learn proper weight training. Forcing myself out the door to go to the\
      \ gym was no longer a problem. After three days without exercise, I would become\
      \ restless. The habit was built! During that winter I kept running through hail\
      \ and snow.\r\n\r\nMy next 10k run (the Midnight Sun Maraton in the city of\

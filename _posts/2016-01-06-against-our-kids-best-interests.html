      \ I\u2019ve yet to figure out is why people do NOT act in their own interest,\

      \n\r\nSo, who's in charge?\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the answer to this question,\

      \ of critical importance if we\u2019re to begin to understand what's going on\
      \ with kids today.\r\n\r\nThe answer, of course, is simple.  Despite the fact\
      \ that they think they are in charge, our children are not.  We adults are.\
      \  Even though the world will be run by those who are children today, the decisions\
      \ that are affecting them before they're old enough to assume leadership are\
      \ being made by us, grown-ups who have the power, who vote, who contribute to\
      \ the public fisc, and who make economic and political decisions that are, at\
      \ least in theory, in the best interests of our children.\r\n\r\nWhy, then,\
      \ do I see such a striking similarity between the symptoms our children are\
      \ exhibiting and the symptoms of victims of traditional torture?\r\n\r\nI first\
      \ began to notice this resemblance decades ago as I studied the effects of war\
      \ and conflict on children.  At that time, because few people in this country\
      \ noticed that our own children were in danger, it was easier to travel to the\
      \ Middle East, the Soviet Union and Northern Ireland to gather my information.\
      \  Recently, I've been stunned by how much our own children resemble those whom\
      \ I've studied overseas.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, many complex issues related\
      \ to any discussion of torture, and it is especially difficult to formulate\
      \ a perfect definition, but in my studies, several key points have stood out.\
      \  The first is in the definition used by the United Nations General Assembly\
      \ in 1984 which states that torture need not be physical, but can also be mental\
      \ maltreatment.  The second is that torture is defined not only by the acts\
      \ committed but also by the individual's response to these acts.\r\n\r\nThink\
      \ about some kids you know and ask yourself these questions about them:  Do\
      \ they have a reduced involvement with, or are they numb to, the external world?\
      \  Do they dissociate and disconnect from friends and loved ones?  Do you sense\
      \ that they experience the loss of the ability to feel close?  Are they anxious,\
      \ depressed, irritable, aggressive?  Have they regressed in behavior and school\
      \ performance?  Do they feel powerless and vulnerable?  And, most striking to\
      \ me, have they lost the ability to maintain an optimistic outlook or a \"futureview\"\
      \ of any kind?  These are symptoms of children who have been tortured and, I\
      \ am afraid, increasingly of our children, too.\r\nSo, who's in charge?\r\n\r\
      \nThe sad fact is that few Americans blame themselves for having contributed\
      \ to the social ills they bemoan.  A recent poll, for example, indicates that\
      \ only 11% of respondents say they believe that their own behavior has contributed\
      \ to the moral problems the nation faces, and 96% say that they believe they\
      \ are doing an excellent or good job teaching their children about morals and\
      \ values.  But 93% say that other parents aren't taking enough responsibility\
      \ for teaching their children moral values.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that we\
      \ remain reluctant to subject our own behavior to criticism or limitations yet\
      \ we profess to abhor the national moral vacuum that surrounds us.  But there\
      \ is no moral vacuum.  There is, however, a moral hypocrisy: the difference\
      \ between what we say and what we do.\r\n\r\n If we talk right and act wrong,\
      \ according to Marion Wright Edelman, we are contributing to the crisis our\
      \ children face.  The phrase should be \"watch my feet,\" not \"watch my lips\"\
      \ because if we are not walking our talk, we are part of the problem and not\
      \ part of the solution.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d appreciate any feedback!\r\n\r\n\r\n\

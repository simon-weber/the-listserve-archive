    body: "The morning I got the email saying I had won the listserve, I was getting\
      \ ready to go into surgery. And as I am currently writing this I'm still a little\
      \ out of sorts, so I apologize if some of this doesn't quite make sense.\r\n\
      \r\nAs to why I was getting surgery I was going in for my second corneal transplant.\
      \ I had one done a few months ago and my body decided to reject it. While there\
      \ are someways of reversing it those methods didn't work. So here I am sitting\
      \ in a hospital while my eye is tearing up like mad and can't see well out of\
      \ my other eye listening to cooking shows cause it's ten o'clock at night and\
      \ nothing is good on.\r\n\r\nI know for a large majority of the world you wake\
      \ up turn over and are able to see your clock or your phone or significant other\
      \ and don't give two thoughts about it. Those are the things I would love to\
      \ be able to do. I would love to be able to read a standard print book without\
      \ it giving me a headache. I normally give up within about twenty minutes. I\
      \ would like not be so nervous going into the DMV to get my license renewed\
      \ for fear that I would fail the vision screening. The day I moved into my dorm\
      \ I had to put in night lights in all the hallways of our apartment so I wouldn't\
      \ trip over my own two feet in the dark. My roommate a few days later while\
      \ she was a little drunk asked me if I was afraid of the dark. I would love\
      \ for my sister not be afraid of getting into a car with me. Not because I'm\
      \ technically a bad driver, `cause she worried I won't see something and we'll\
      \ end up in an accident.\r\n\r\nI'm not ashamed of having this disease. I will\
      \ easily and gladly tell people about it. But there somethings that when you\
      \ have perfect or a corrected sight are hard to explain. Some people wish for\
      \ money and better job. I wish that my vision wasn't as bad as it is. Before\
      \ the surgery, I was 20/400 uncorrected and corrected I am 20/120. Legally blind\
      \ is 20/200 corrected. I'm nearly there. I wholeheartedly believe that my vision\
      \ will get better after this. That's what I'm holding on to.\r\n\r\nSo as a\
      \ final word please get an eye exam regularly. It may seem silly if you feel\
      \ like you're seeing fine but there are many problems that a regular doctor\
      \ won't be able to see like a optometrist can. Also please become a donor. You\
      \ can't say you would accept a donation if you were sick and in the same breathe\
      \ say that you're not a donor. It doesn't work that way. If you believe that\
      \ you have health conditions that would make it so that your organs wouldn't\
      \ be viable there are many different ways for the medical and scientific community\
      \ to use them. There are also ways to make so you only donate certain parts\
      \ if that's your decision. Even if you choose not to become an organ donor,\
      \ there are many other types of donation ranging from blood to bone marrow that\
      \ could save someones life. Please do give it some deep thought.\r\n\r\nI wish\
      \ you all the best of luck.\r\n\r\nJennifer\r\njennifer.listserve@gmail.com\r\

      \ 15 February 2013, thank you. Your thoughts on BSL have kept me going through\

      a quick story about one of my experiences</p>

      <p>The Red Earth</p>

      <p>Welcome to Kinshasa!! Keep your head down, lie flat in the car and keep your
      bags beside you. That&#8217;s the first sentence said to me as I get out of
      N&#8217;djili airport at the democratic republic of Congo. As I leave the airport
      five bodyguards with guns bigger than me surround me towards my bullet proof
      car. The driver zips off as soon as my head hits the ground. On the way to the
      brewery I try to take several peaks out the window. All I can see are red flames
      dancing over burning houses and all I hear are rounds of ammunition being fired
      not unlike when the drops of the African monsoon hit the tin laden shanties.
      Kinshasa is burning. President Kabila has just been reelected and it seems that
      not many people are happy with that. While all this is happening I&#8217;ve
      got three months to try and sell beer to the very people who are trying to burn
      every moving vehicle, including mine. That shouldn&#8217;t be difficult considering
      war and beer have had an intimate relationship akin to Romeo and Juliet.</p>

      <p>As I enter the expat district, things change dramatically. Straight clean
      roads are being patrolled with armored vehicles patrolling the streets. There&#8217;s
      lighting, open shops and even many locals walking around not trying to kill
      me. &#8220;We are safe now grand chef&#8217; Ilnyas, my driver says to me. &#8220;you
      can come out now&#8221;.  I tentatively sit up straight and light up my Dunhill&#8217;s
      with my trembling hands. We reach the brewery. An opulent gate opens up to a
      vast landscape of beauty. A line of tall buildings come into my vision, followed
      quickly by rows and rows of picturesque European row houses with manicured gardens,
      a large swimming pool, basically the works. I reach my row house. I enter with
      5 bedrooms and 3 butlers all waiting to do my bidding. &#8220;My oasis in hell&#8221;
      I say to myself. Heineken definitely makes you live king-size.</p>

      <p>Over the next three months I scoured the city, flanked by my AK laden guards
      and tried to sell as much beer as I could across roads so uneven that the roads
      of Bangalore would feel like a dream. Across districts filthy with dust, dirt,

      <p>Among all the chaos the only soothing sense is the ear. Everywhere you can

      The sounds of defiance.</p>

      <p>These people have seen violence for 60 years. Since the Belgians left, many
      pillagers have come and raped this beautiful country. But the people survived.
      They rebuild and rebuild till another catastrophe washes everything away after
      which they build again.</p>

      <p>Chase<br />Sometimes, you just want something. You can''t stop before you
      actually try to obtain it, if you fail then that''s fine it didn''t work. But,
      if you don''t try, you sit and wonder what if... What if''s are the worst! If
      you ever have a decision to make, ask yourself will I look back and think what
      if... if yes, then do it! Period. It might not be something you really want
      after all, or it could be everything you could ever have dreamt of. The risk
      is worth it. </p>

      <p>Morality<br /> Do something stupid, but not wrong. There is no reason to
      make anyone ever feel lesser, to ever treat someone as if they don''t deserve
      something. Wronging someone may not haunt your conscience, but it might mess
      someone up completely. You will hurt people, you will get hurt... Just keep
      your intentions for what you were trying to do clean.  </p>

      <p>Insecurity<br />The early days of my life of bullying shelled me to never
      let my guard down, or to always act confident. It fended them off. Personally,
      I don''t believe there is much to be cocky about for me, but things you develop
      in childhood are just hard to drop. But, deep down I am just as insecure as
      everyone else. One of the biggest things I have learned, is that everyone is
      insecure about something. And, we pretty much build this life around overcoming
      these insecurities! Respect others, but also respect yourself to be flawed as
      a human.</p>

      <p>Risks <br />I live by a motto that I sometimes do not always believe in,
      but is my attitude towards life anyways: "I am the happiest person I know."
      Everything that has happened to me, made me who I am. I have regrets, big regrets.
      But, if I lived so safely that I never had to regret something... I believe
      that would have been my biggest regret ever. Risks, are never as terrible as
      you play them out in your head. Look up "catastrophizing."</p>

      <p>Parents<br />My parents are my everything. There is no greater motivation
      for me, than the two people who have sacrificed meals for me to be able to eat.
      Who have sacrificed there desires to help pay for college. Who have spoiled
      this kid, but taught him humility. Constantly, told me that life is not about

      <p>Two truths and a lie is a game I love to play with strangers. It''s a great
      icebreaker. When I play with friends, I have to get creative, as they usually
      know what actually happened and what''s a figment of my imagination. But with
      strangers, it is easy to pull from the archives.</p>

      <p>A year ago, to this day, I found myself in the company of four other strangers,
      who quickly became fast friends on our eight-day trek to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro,
      the tallest mountain in Africa. We had reconvened in the tent after hours of
      hiking thru the picturesque Tanzanian terrain. Oddly, I must have given a different
      impression to the group, as the immediate and general consensus was "No, you
      don''t have a travel blog."</p>

      <p>My adventure travel companion and best friend, Jackie, sat in the tent tight
      lipped trying her best not to reveal any clues. I clarified to the group that
      I meant to say that I killed a chicken with my bare hands and not a bear chicken
      but they were still adamant that I didn''t have a travel blog and swore they
      recognized me from the great American television show. (Unfortunately, this
      was the lie as I have yet to be on Survivor).</p>

      <p>Shortly after the trek, I returned home to my bright (and teary) eyed family
      and friends to answer numerous questions about this oh so challenging but ever
      so rewarding experience. After a few questions about the loss of oxygen (and
      my mind) with increasing altitude, summiting Kili and you know, not showering
      for eight days straight, I found myself stuck with the same question.</p>

      <p>&#8220;So, what&#8217;s next?&#8221;</p>

      <p>It&#8217;s a year later and the question still lingers, as it should. I&#8217;m
      not going to sign up to conquer the remaining seven summits. Not yet. Nor am
      I going to spend the rest of my vacation days climbing Mount Everest. Every

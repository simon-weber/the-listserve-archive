  body: "I was always the type to make excuses. I had an excuse for why I was running\
    \ late, why I didn't exercise, why I was moody, or why I was overwhelmed. \r\n\
    \r\nRecently, I decided that I would no longer make excuses for myself. I would\
    \ begin to hold myself accountable, but still honor what I was feeling. I would\
    \ exercise more, eat locally, make new friends, enjoy my job, and quit letting\
    \ external factors determine what my next excuse would be. I would now hold the\
    \ key to my destiny, as it is not predetermined by anyone besides myself. \r\n\
    \r\nSince the day I eliminated all excuses, I have finished my first triathlon\
    \ and will be doing two more this summer. I have lost 25 pounds. I have opened\
    \ myself up to new friendships. I am a better person, partner, friend, and companion\
    \ not only to others, but also to myself. And I feel great! \r\n\r\nI have learned\
    \ that you truly must love yourself first, inside and out. I have learned that\
    \ if your outside doesn't match your inside (or vice versa) you have the means\
    \ within YOU to change it. No excuse will help you get better, only time, dedication,\
    \ and willingness to CHANGE. \r\n\r\nSo, today I encourage each of you to consider\
    \ not making excuses for one day. When your mind thinks, I'm going to skip out\
    \ on ____, realize that's an excuse and do it anyway. \r\n\r\nTry it for one day,\
    \ and send me an email to let me know how it went. We are all on this life journey\
    \ together. We might as well have some fun with it.  Challenge yourself. Be bold.\
    \ Laugh often. After all, life is good :) \r\n\r\n\r\nCheers, \r\n\r\nSamantha\

    \ 99.9% of the world is good, it's the .1% that we often worry about. Make it\

      in the Peace Corps in the Dominican Republic and Panama for 2 years, 11 months
      and 23 days.</p>

      <p>1) Check your ego.<br />I can use one liter of water to take a shower, kill
      chickens, pigs and cockroaches, stay in touch with my loved ones across oceans,
      train community health promoters and work successfully in ambiguous situations.&#160;But,&#160;I
      cannot bring about world peace or cure cancer; I am no longer the doe-eyed,
      self-important, chip-on-my-shoulder liberal arts school graduate who believes
      I can change the world in three years...but collectively, we need to keep trying.</p>

      <p>2) Learn to work for people, not things.<br />Prioritize people, connections,
      relationships and friendships over&#160;things. I learned to open my heart so
      damn wide that I didn&#8217;t think anyone else could squeeze in, but community
      members kept showing up and I kept loving. The connections we make our communities
      will make us whole &#8211; jeans, watches, cars and nice cheese alone will not.
      Optimize for&#160;people&#160;and let them fill you up!</p>

      <p>3) Don&#8217;t be afraid to mess up.<br />Be willing to fail, look like an
      idiot, laugh at yourself and learn from others &#8211; if you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll
      never learn bachata, to ride a motorcycle or to develop a rural emergency medical
      system. Give in, lean in and go for it - fail hard, fail fast and keep going.</p>

      <p>4) Manage expectations.<br />I dreamt of living in a wooden shack in the
      middle of the jungle, yet I ended up living with a family of ten on the border
      of Haiti. It wasn&#8217;t what I expected, but it turned out to be better. Let&#160;nothing&#160;be
      a loss, because nothing is. Don&#8217;t waste time regretting what could or
      should have been.</p>

      <p>5) Be a good houseguest and an even better host.<br />It takes minimal effort
      to be a good houseguest and slightly more effort to be a great host - invest
      the time and energy into becoming both.&#160;As a houseguest:&#160;Disengage
      from your electronics, keep your space tidy, bring chocolate and do the&#160;damn&#160;dishes.&#160;As
      a host:&#160;Sweep your house, clean the toilet, stock up on coffee and encourage
      your guests to try the local cow foot stew.</p>

      <p>6) Find simple joys.<br />Smile when you milk your first cow for fresh milk,
      see your first live birth or teach a child to read. Appreciate phone calls with
      your mother, the laughter of a child, the deliciousness of a home cooked meal,
      the beauty in human connections and the endless sources of joy in the world.
      For these precious moments everyday, smile.</p>

      <p>7) Live on purpose.&#160;<br />Occupy this world with passion, energy, confidence
      and purpose. Never stop learning, listening, trying, doing and&#160;becoming.&#160;Your
      mind is meant to grow, your body is meant to live. Know when to take care of
      yourself: when to drink the local spiced rum (or when not to), to stay in pjs
      and binge on The Good Wife, to say yes to salsa night. Drink plenty of water,
      wear sunscreen and tend to infected bug bites. Trust that life is leading exactly
      where you are meant to go.</p>

      <p>A very special thanks to Merle and Mike who got me hooked on The Listserve;
      we have kept in touch cross-country and grown our strong and unique friendship
      through many of Listserve emails!</p>

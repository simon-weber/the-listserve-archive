      \ on \u2018Oh shit got no shoes on, we\u2019ll have to go back\u2019, that was\
      \ kind of stupid.\n\nHe did use his intelligence to get a degree in Mechanical\
      \ Engineering and teach children Kayaking and climbing, but I liked to remind\
      \ him of the stupid moments more than these.\n\nHis determination and complete\
      \ love of life led him in so many directions, being a DJ, learning to fly a\
      \ plane, and all the while he wanted to better himself. He came back from India\

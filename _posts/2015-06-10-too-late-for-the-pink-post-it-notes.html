      <p>A Story:</p>

      <p>One night a good friend (Luke)  and I went to a field for a bonfire and stargazing.
      While there, Luke got a phone call from a friend. I took the opportunity and
      slipped away with a handful of post it notes in my pocket. See I desperately
      needed to pee. Covering my tracks I walked a huge circle away from Luke into
      the dark. Behind a hay bale I did my business. I also left a few post it notes
      behind that had helped my endeavor and got back to the fire.  After Luke got
      off the phone he left to answer nature&#8217;s call - behind the same hay bale.<br
      />    When he got back he was holding several pink post it notes in his hand.
      When I asked him why he had them he explained he&#8217;d found them and wanted
      to check them out in the light to see if they had words  on them. I could not
      stop laughing. But finally after a good 10 minutes of silent gut clutching laughter
      i told him he should really get rid of the post its. &#8220;Why?&#8221; he asked.
      &#8220;because they''re pee post its!&#8221;  and then another burst of laughter.
      Ah, I love curious people. Only curious people can get into predicaments like
      handling toilet paper post it notes.</p>

      <p>A Song<br />I really love the song: Come thou fount of every blessing.<br
      />the line &#8220;bind my wandering heart to thee&#8221; is so fitting, my heart
      wanders every which way<br />Also: Hero by Family of the Year  is one of my
      favorites these days</p>

      <p>Ephesians 2:8-9</p>

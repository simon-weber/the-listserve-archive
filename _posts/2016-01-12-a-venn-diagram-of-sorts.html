    body: '<p>Hello ! I''m excited to share with you one of my biggest passions and
      one of my biggest fears, and how they overlap-ish :</p>

      <p>A : My greatest passion is architecture. Architecture and design are everywhere.
      I''m currently getting my masters in architecture in New York City, but I originally
      studied anthropology. When I first started studying architecture, the only things
      I could talk about were buildings and their effects on behavior until a friend
      told me he didn''t care about architecture at all. Initially, I was shocked
      &#8212; everyone lives, works and interacts with architecture on a daily basis,
      how could someone not care? I then realized &#8212; not everyone will care about
      what I care about most.</p>

      <p>Studying architecture, I''ve learned that someone has designed almost everything
      around us, and that has dramatically changed the way I see the world. From the
      spoon we use for our cereal to the buildings we work in, it has all been designed.
      Paying attention to design adds levels of appreciation to the most mundane activities.
      Noticing the way light enters a space, or even the weight of different objects
      can add a level of awareness and presence to any given moment. Careful design
      isn''t just a visual aesthetic, it impacts our experience, perception, and mental
      and physical health. Increasing awareness of design can brighten our day, and
      better yet, understanding design begins to give credit and agency to designers
      themselves and their hard work.</p>

      <p>B : My greatest fear is systemic violence. I am terrified when I see the
      growing Islamophobia, racial violence, and sexism in the media and on the street
      every day. When I think about how people are cruel to one another based on prejudices
      about each other''s identities'', to be honest, I''m scared out of my mind.</p>

      <p>I, myself, know that I''m very privileged, but being a brown woman in the
      United States has made me very aware of how people with the same capabilities
      and ambition as me don''t necessarily have the same incredible opportunities
      I have. If you are lucky enough to have some form of privilege, it means a lot
      to think about those who don''t to prevent the cycles of systemic violence.
      Understanding systemic violence is difficult and complicated, especially if
      you do not feel personally affected by discrimination or prejudice.</p>

      <p>A+B : My love of architecture and my fear of systemic violence meet in the
      middle as I''m trying to find ways to design solutions that will positively
      impact individuals and communities. Design has the potential solve many of the
      world''s biggest problems in new and innovative ways, from housing shortages
      to disaster relief to clean water.</p>

      <p>I strongly believe that with privilege comes a responsibility to empathize
      with and help those who are less fortunate. The world will be a better place
      if we each make an effort to pay more attention to discrimination and to fight
      it to help those around us live equally fulfilling lives. Do something about
      it.</p>

      <p>Might as well try and see what happens, right?</p>

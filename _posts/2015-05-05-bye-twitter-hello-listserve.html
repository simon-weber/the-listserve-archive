      \ of winning the ListServe. I feel like I'm back in school writing an essay\
      \ the morning it's due.\r\n\r\nI am going to publish an audio version of this\
      \ email on my podcast - just search for \"Goodstuff Daily(ish) 85\". I'm often\
      \ interested in the voice of a person behind a story or article so if you're\
      \ like me and would prefer to listen, here's your opportunity.\r\n\r\nFor Lent\
      \ this year I gave up using my personal Twitter account. It wasn't done in some\
      \ grand, dramatic statement over the evilness of Twitter - just a desire to\
      \ see what kind of effect it was having on my day to day thoughts and ideas.\
      \ (You can hear my thoughts on this from another podcast I was on by searching\
      \ for \"Goodstuff Grown-ups 17\".) And I have to say that despite feeling like\
      \ a Twitter addict - in the best sense of the word - it wasn't as difficult\
      \ to stop using Twitter as I thought it would be. \r\n\r\nThe main benefit I\
      \ found was that I had more time to think through my opinions on events, news\
      \ and happenings in my world without having everyone's opinion thrust in my\
      \ face - albeit willingly. It seems silly, but it did give me clarity of thought.\
      \ \r\n\r\nI've since gone back on to Twitter - say hi @ichris - but with a much\
      \ smaller list that I read regularly. I still dip my toes into the main timeline\
      \ of the 500+ people I follow, but I'm ok with missing out on everything that's\
      \ happening.\r\n\r\nIn case you couldn't tell already, I love podcasts - both\
      \ listening and recording/producing them. And one podcast I do is called Show\
      \ Me Your Mic where I interview other podcasters about their podcast. Meta upon\
      \ meta. But I end each show asking them what podcasts they are enjoying currently.\
      \ And since I don't get to ever say my own, I thought I'd end by listing of\
      \ some podcasts you should check out if you're looking for something to listen\
      \ to on the drive home, while walking the dog, or just sitting on the couch:\r\
      \n\r\n- Back to Work with Merlin Mann and Dan Benjamin: the best podcast about\
      \ comics that's not about comics\r\n- 99% Invisible\r\n- Exponent - Ben and\
      \ James discuss the tech world with smarts I don't possess\r\n- Here's the Thing\
      \ with Alec Baldwin\r\n- Transmission - the internet's morning show.\r\n- The\
      \ Incomparable - particularly their episodes on Star Wars.\r\n- Build & Launch\
      \ - by a fellow Canadian dude if you enjoy entrepreneurial web biz dev discussions\r\
      \n- One for self-promotion: The podcast network I run with some friends can\
      \ be found by searching \"Goodstuff podcasts\" and hosts a variety of shows\
      \ that you may enjoy. \r\n\r\nThank you for the opportunity to talk to all 20k+\
      \ of you. I hope I got at least a 60% on this essay so I don't have to take\
      \ summer classes.\r\n\r\nHug your kids, have patience and love for your family\

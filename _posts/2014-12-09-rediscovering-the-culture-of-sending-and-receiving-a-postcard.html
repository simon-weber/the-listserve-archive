      <p>I am a 28 year-old guy from the Dominican Republic, (a nice place in the
      Caribbean) and I want to talk to you about a hobby I started last year. Have
      you ever heard about Postcrossing? When was the last time you received a postcard?  When
      was the last time you sent a postcard?</p>

      <p>Well, Postcrossing is a nice Project that allows you to &#8220;send a postcard
      and received a postcard back from a random person in the world&#8221;.  More
      than a hobby I found this project as a way to learn about other cultures; every
      postcard I received has its own story, its own mystic.</p>

      <p>How it works?</p>

      <p>The first step is to register on the Postcrossing site (You can google it:
      Postcrossing). Then you would be able to request to send a postcard. The website
      will display (and send you an email) with the address of another member and

      is on the postcard. At this point, you are eligible to receive a postcard from
      another user. You are now in line for the next person that requests to send
      a postcard. Where the postcard comes from is a surprise!</p>

      <p>You can have up to 5 postcards traveling at any single time. Every time one
      of the postcards you send is registered, you can request another address. The
      number of postcards allowed to travel at any single time goes up the more postcards
      you send!</p>

      <p>A simple request...</p>

      <p>I&#8217;d like to hear from you guys, would you mind sending me a postcard
      from where you are?</p>

      <p>Let me share a part of my life with you. Exactly two years ago I started
      my current job. At a hostel chain in the Netherlands where - after being in
      social welfare for nearly a year - I was so happy to fine a full-time position.
      Which meant I would have (more) money, and would be able to leave my parents
      place again. To which I was more or less forced due to a lack of financial means
      at age 28&#8230;after having lived by myself the previous 10 years.</p>

      <p>The last two years have passed swiftly. I have paid off all my student debts;
      poring nearly 1000 EUR in your debt the day your salary arrives feels awkward
      I can tell you that. (small note: fuck this debt-ridden consumptionism society).
      At work I have revamped almost the complete web infrastructure. Money is being
      made, and everybody is happy. But I''ll leave my job end of August. I see question
      marks on the faces of all my colleagues: why leave before reaping what you saw?
      There is crisis out there!? It is time to move on.</p>

      <p>To what, to where? I don''t know. Having arrived at age 30 I thought the
      road to take would somehow be easier, contours would be more crisp. The exact
      opposite is the case&#8230; I don''t have a clue, I''m totally fucking lost.</p>

      <p>Even with this weird opportunity to send a message to 21,422 people, I&#8217;d
      rather just send you a birthday note. So, listen up:</p>

      <p>You are f$%&amp;ing awesome.</p>

      <p>I know it&#8217;s been a pretty weird (weird = kind of crappy and also legitimately
      weird) year for you, but you&#8217;re less than a week away from a fresh start.</p>

      <p>Last year you:</p>

      <p>Took a paid sabbatical.<br />Tried stand up comedy.<br />Realized stand up
      comedy was not your jam and tried writing funny stuff instead.<br />Wrote funny
      stuff.<br />Helped a lot of vets.<br />Stopped being a vegan.<br />Became one
      of my best friends.</p>

      <p>This year you will:</p>

      <p>Realize that you are f$%&amp;ing awesome.<br />Try improv comedy.<br />Tell
      someone exactly why he or she should hire you and believe it.<br />Tell your
      dumb boss exactly what you think (at least once).<br />Teach someone else how
      to be a great friend who does things like sending text messages at 8:25 AM on
      Monday mornings that say &#8220;Here&#8217;s to a good week!&#8221; even though
      you know it won&#8217;t be.<br />Re-read Fierce Invalids and learn something
      new about Switters.</p>

      <p>I know you will.</p>

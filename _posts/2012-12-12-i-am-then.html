  body: "Where are you right now? On your couch at home? At your desk at work? Standing\
    \ in line at a coffee shop? Wherever you are, you will always be there. Wherever\
    \ you were an hour ago, that \"you\" will always be there. Every moment exists\
    \ in time. Think about it. It then follows that whatever you will be doing in\
    \ the future....is already happening. Take it however you wish (\"What about free\
    \ will?\"), but think about the novelty of it; specifically, what it means to\
    \ be \"in the past.\"\r\n\r\nYou will always be sitting at your desk. Or on your\
    \ couch. This very second -- the one right now -- now -- ......now -- of you reading\
    \ this sentence, remains. Forever. Sorry if you think it was wasted. But you (and\
    \ I) will forever be sitting in front of a computer at work  or stuck in traffic\
    \ or saying goodbye to a friend  or preparing for surgery or some kind of therapy\
    \ or going through a bad breakup or holding in a heavy, dark secret.\r\n\r\nThat\
    \ breath you just took? You'll be breathing in for all eternity, in a sense.\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n Now doesn't that make you feel sick.\r\n\r\n\r\n But you have to remember\
    \ that everything exists somewhere in time. That includes the day I made a fool\
    \ of myself in class and broke out of my shell; the best present you were ever\
    \ given as a kid; the best end-of-finals party ever thrown; the day I found out\
    \ he liked me at all; that reassuring phone call; the day she decided to spend\
    \ time with you instead of him;  all those days before taking on that secret.\r\
    \n\r\nSometimes, I have to focus on the past to remember who I am as a person.\
    \ My grandparents are all young and happy at one point or another, however short-lived\
    \ their childhoods may have been. She's gone now, but Nicole exists somewhere\
    \ in time as my first friend in high school, and will always be walking up to\
    \ me to say hello.  I am still perched on the steps of Casa Malaparte with a sketchbook.\
    \ I am literally running -- racing my friends and teachers -- through the streets\
    \ of Istanbul with the prayer calls from the mosques are echoing around me. I\
    \ am a baby playing in the creek by my aunt's house; I can barely walk on my own.\
    \ I am wading by myself halfway across the stream, searching for interesting rocks.\
    \ I am taking a series of pictures by the water and proclaiming my wedding vows\
    \ on a nearby hill (which won't happen until 2014, assuming the world won't end\
    \ on the 21st).\r\n\r\nIt's what happened before that shaped me. It's the thought\
    \ of their eternal existence that continues to have an effect on me. If I linger\
    \ on the subject too much, I begin to feel closed in and surrounded by everything\
    \ that has ever happened; all the people that used to live in this house, all\
    \ the big trees that used to be seeds; all the papers and posters on the walls\
    \ that were printed in rooms far away from me.... Yet at the same time, it's comforting\
    \ to know that I am part of the fabric of time and place; I contribute to our\
    \ entire history and future.\r\n\r\nI am always utterly aware of where and when\
    \ I am. I am now. I am then. I am, then.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if you really read all\
    \ of this (I know it's long, I'm sorry), thank you for the opportunity to email\
    \ you all. And welcome to Einstein's Theory of Relativity, if you weren't familiar\
    \ with it before. If you know more on the subject and wish to share, or if you're\
    \ an architecture nerd like me and want to talk design, feel free to respond!\r\
    \n\r\nP.S. - Just so you all know, I sent this to the Listserve people at 12:12:12\
    \ on 12/12/12. So what you're reading now is that moment - a time stamp which\
    \ won't repeat for another century. BAM. Enjoy your day!\r\n\r\n\r\nCervantes\t\

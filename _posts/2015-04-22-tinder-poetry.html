      <p>I am not a writer, a poet, or anything related by training. But I like to
      jot in the margins--create someone''s story on BART (public transit), have a
      solo-beer and draw etc. </p>

      <p>I am curious to hear what y''all think about this poem, and if you really
      want to take it to the next level, workshop it and send me edits!</p>

      <p>"I want to set you up with the girl I am tindering"</p>

      <p>I''m lost in your bloody marry tree house.<br />Rope swinging by fibers of
      your savory thoughts, <br />Splashing on the shores of your vodka soaked vitamin
      D, <br />Drying off on a beached bun, <br />Tiptoeing on the rim of your glass.</p>

      <p>Tipsy, <br />I tumble off your edge, <br />Cascading down oblique hills of
      olives.<br />I plummet through vodka paradise, <br />Straight into a pillow
      of pulp.</p>

      <p>You look down, <br />Open your mouth, <br />and without words, <br />Swallow
      me whole.</p>

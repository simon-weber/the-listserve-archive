<p>I'm going to get straight to the point. I'm 13 and I've created a petition; it's an issue I feel strongly about and my target is to reach 100 signatures. So far I have ninety nine... if I could get 1 person out of 20,000 of you to sign then it would be a success.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I can't give you a link or the HTML but if you google search "stop the return of bullfighting to TV" and click on the first link you'll have reached your destination. I created it via Avaaz community petitions but anyone can sign.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time. </p>

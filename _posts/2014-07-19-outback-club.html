    body: "Hey everyone,\r\n\r\nI am writing to you from Mundrabilla Roadhouse in\
      \ the outback of Western Australia. I\u2019m a 27 year old from Ontario,Canada\
      \ who\u2019s been living in Australia on a working holiday visa for nearly two\
      \ years now. While I have seen some incredible coastlines and met some incredible\
      \ people I have chosen to write about my current situation which is at an extremely\
      \ remote roadhouse along the Eyre highway.\r\n\r\nFor anyone that doesn\u2019\
      t know, this highway is the only route linking South Australia \_to Western\
      \ Australia. The Western Australia part of the highway is virtually treeless,\
      \ flat, saltbush covered terrain that is practically unchanging. I am 13 hours\
      \ inland from Adelaide and 16 hours inland from Perth. There are no towns out\
      \ here, only roadhouses located about 100-200 kms apart from each other. Due\
      \ to it\u2019s remoteness some parts of the highway are even used as emergency\
      \ airstrips for the Royal Flying Doctor Service.\r\n\r\nIn March, I decided\
      \ I would spend 6 months of my last visa out here. My primary reason \_to come\
      \ out \_was to cash up and set myself up for the next adventure. Out here you\u2019\
      ve got all kinds of money and no place to go. Our big nights out consist of\
      \ driving to the next roadhouse to get lattes because we only have instant coffee\
      \ or walking up the back of the property to get away from the sound of the generator\
      \ and see some kangaroos and emus. Let\u2019s be honest though, coffee isn\u2019\
      t everything, I do drink a fair bit of wine to keep things interesting.\r\n\r\
      \nSome days the silence, isolation and lack of social life really makes me wonder\
      \ whether it\u2019s \_worth doing something you hate just for money? To be fair,\
      \ I don\u2019t hate it completely. It is such a unique experience relying on\
      \ a generator for power and desalinated ground water to drink. You really do\
      \ learn to live with the bare essentials and I\u2019m happy with that aspect\
      \ of it. We look forward to our toiletry orders coming every month as if it\
      \ was some flash new toy. On the other hand I am doing simple, mindless work\
      \ that really allows too much time for thinking. Thinking of the more beautiful\
      \ aussie towns I could be in, thinking of what else I could be doing, thinking\
      \ of the places I won\u2019t get to see in Australia because I\u2019ve committed\
      \ so much time here. On a weekly basis you really go through a roller coaster\
      \ of emotions which is the part that I hate.\r\n\r\nThere are about 10 of us\
      \ out here, the family that own the business, a couple of managers, and then\
      \ us, the workers, the backpackers that the roadhouse relies on to operate the\
      \ business. Currently, there are 4 here: Helene, a lovely, young lass from France\
      \ (whom I just introduced to the Listserve) Matt, our wannabe pommy from Perth\
      \ and Bean, a pint sized art teacher from Taiwan. Without these guys I would\
      \ have fled the scene long ago. We keep each other sane, I like to think so\
      \ anyway. We all plan \_to travel after so we constantly motivate ourselves\
      \ to stick it out by chatting of the countless ways we are going to roam around\
      \ Asia spending all our hard earned cash from Mundrabilla.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes\

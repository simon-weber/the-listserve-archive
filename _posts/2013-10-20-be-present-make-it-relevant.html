      \ to read just a few more sentences of my email. \r\nI want to talk to you briefly\
      \ about two things.\r\n\r\nFirst, the Chewonki Organization. (Chewonki? What\
      \ does that even mean? Is that a word? Only one way to find out-- read on!)\r\
      \nSecond, systemic racism. Chances are, you haven't been taught about it. Not\
      \ your fault, just statistics.\r\n\r\nSo, what is Chewonki? The Chewonki organization\
      \ is based in southern coastal Maine and has numerous programs to connect people\
      \ with their place in the natural world. I attended the Chewonki Semester school,\
      \ meaning I spent 4 months of my junior year living and studying with around\
      \ 50 students and faculty in Wiscasset, ME. That semester was undoubtedly the\
      \ most influential time of my life. The close-knit community taught me so much\
      \ about my place in the world, hard work, my relationship with nature, and who\
      \ I was. Chewonki has become an integral part of my soul.\r\n\r\nStudents live\
      \ in cabins with ~7 other people and tend to their own wood stoves. They help\
      \ on the campus's farm (alongside the absolutely amazing staff). They take amazing\
      \ and rigorous classes with the best teachers I've ever had the honor of learning\
      \ from (coming from two of the most \"prestigious\" schools in the country).\
      \ They will meet the most amazing students imaginable from across the country.\
      \ They will laugh like crazy. And when it's over, they will cry. \r\n\r\nI ask\
      \ you to think about whether you know any young people who could benefit from\
      \ Chewonki. I'm not trying market them-- I honestly hope that each student can\
      \ have access to the amazing opportunity that I did. Applications to the program\
      \ are due in sophomore year. There is financial aid. If someone you think could\
      \ be interested isn't the right age-- check out their camps. A quick google\
      \ of \"Chewonki\" will take you to their site immediately. Even if you don't\
      \ know anyone, just look at the pictures :)\r\n\r\nSecond, systemic racism.\
      \ I hope that after reading the following links you gain some insight into just\
      \ how present racism is in American society today. It's less blatant than it\
      \ has been in the past, but its current form of manifestation is much more toxic\
      \ in my opinion. I believe that if you are in a privileged position, it is your\
      \ responsibility to educate yourself about the systems affecting oppressed people,\
      \ so read up on it.\r\n\r\nI know you're a lot less likely to read these because\
      \ I can't include links-- but just do it. Copy and paste the next few lines\
      \ into Google and read the articles they link to. If you really read them, they\
      \ will change your life:\r\n\r\n1. The Invisible Knapsack of White Privilege\
      \ by Peggy McIntosh-- good intro to the concept of \"privilege\" in a non-economic\
      \ way\r\n2.  28 Common Racist Attitudes and Behaviors (the URL should be from\
      \ St. Cloud state)-- this is by far my favorite resource\r\n3. The Four Is of\
      \ Oppression YouthBuild -- this will give you a good understanding of how oppression\
      \ works and why \"reverse racism\" doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you to the\
      \ too-fantastic Julia Dornbusch for showing me the list serve (she also went\

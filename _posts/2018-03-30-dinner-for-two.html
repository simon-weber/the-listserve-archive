      \ the phone said, putting on that concerned tone like he knew what I was going\

      \ my nose\u2014up in their ears, and making me whisper sweet nothings from some\
      \ other phone\u2019s ass. You\u2019re tellin me you want that life?\u201D\r\n\
      \r\n\u201CNo,\u201D I said. I did not want that. \u201CBut I\u2019m fast food.\

      <p>&#8220;She&#8217;s gourmet,&#8221; I said to the phone. &#8220;Of course
      I want to go out with her. Next to her I&#8217;m like dog food.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;So what&#8217;s the problem?&#8221; the phone asked back.</p>

      <p>&#8220;The problem? I can&#8217;t even afford to go out to a nice restaurant
      by myself, that&#8217;s the problem. How do you expect me to afford a dinner
      for two?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Oh, come on,&#8221; the phone said, putting on that concerned tone
      like he knew what I was going through. He didn&#8217;t. Phones had all the money.
      Everyone everywhere needed a phone to do everything. He couldn&#8217;t help
      but to roll in the bakers&#8212;it was how he was built. &#8220;This is a new
      day and age,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The girl will even pick up the waiter these
      days. They call it dutch ovening or something, I don&#8217;t know. The point
      is, even a cheap ass sack of fries and a greasy burger dressed up in a paper
      suit deserve to sit on a nice table with a pretty girl every once in a while.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy for you to say,&#8221; wasn&#8217;t too difficult
      for me to say. &#8220;You&#8217;re a phone.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;What?&#8221; the phone said, tone: offended. &#8220;You think my life
      is problem free? Those animals are always grabbing me, spitting on my ass, putting
      my face&#8212;that&#8217;s where my mouth is, you know, and my nose&#8212;up
      in their ears, and making me whisper sweet nothings from some other phone&#8217;s
      ass. You&#8217;re tellin me you want that life?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;No,&#8221; I said. I did not want that. &#8220;But I&#8217;m fast
      food. I&#8217;m gonna&#8212;&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;What? So you&#8217;re afraid then?&#8221; the phone cut me off. I
      wasn&#8217;t even sure I was close enough to his butt for him to hear me.</p>

      <p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not afraid,&#8221; I said anyway.</p>

      between you and your gourmet date, a sweet, beautiful violin singing in the
      background, accompanied by an a capella orchestra?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;Well, sure, who hasn&#8217;t? But I&#8217;m fast food!&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter, kid. It&#8217;s your destiny. I&#8217;ve
      made the call already. Get ready for the ride of your life.&#8221;</p>

      <p>#</p>

      <p>I won&#8217;t bore you with the details of the ride. Suffice it to say that
      it was the ride of my life. The table I ended up on deserves a little more description,
      but the phone has already gotten to that: candles, a capella orchestra, and&#8212;best
      of all&#8212;my gourmet date.</p>

      <p>Ooh, what was she, though? I couldn&#8217;t see her from that angle, with

      I&#8217;ve probably never smelled anything beyond.</p>

      <p>&#8220;Ahem.&#8221; I cleared my throat of greasy phlegm. &#8220;Hello,&#8221;
      I ventured over the candlelight.</p>

      <p>Gourmet gagged. &#8220;Ew. You have got to be kidding me.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I&#8212;excuse me.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t like the tone of her voice.</p>

      <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re fast food!&#8221; she screeched.</p>

      <p>&#8220;I&#8212;uh&#8212;&#8221; Of course. &#8220;The phone didn&#8217;t
      tell you?&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;I thought it had to be a joke. It is a joke, isn&#8217;t it? You&#8217;re
      not fast food, there&#8217;s something more under that paper veneer.&#8221;</p>

      <p>&#8220;No, I&#8212;&#8221; I complained, but a hand&#8212;ugh, the most disgusting
      thing imaginable&#8212;ripped my clothes off and lifted me naked for the entire
      world to see.</p>

      <p>Gourmet giggled now. It was so much worse than gagging. My insides turned
      pink. I gave up, gave in. There was nothing more for me. Thank the Holy Cow,

      \ and I are both in our late 30s.  More than 15 years ago, she would spend time\
      \ at my house with other friends, though I was never home during these visits.\
      \  She was a waitress at one of my favorite restaurants in Kansas City.  We\
      \ would frequent the same spots around town, yet we \u201Cmissed out\u201D on\
      \ several opportunities to meet.  We have both been married, but it took Tinder\
      \ for us to finally meet last summer.  Even though I say we \u201Cmissed out\u201D\
      , we really didn\u2019t!  We have both had amazing lives, and just weren\u2019\
      t ready for each other.  Today, we\u2019re happily engaged and in the process\
      \ of buying a new home together.  We\u2019re calling this \u201CThe 3rd Chapter\u201D\

      Other random things going through my head right now that I would like to say:\r\
      \nDon\u2019t live the same year 75 times, and call it a life.\r\nGet a passport.\

      \ most of my life, I was morbidly obese.  At my heaviest I weighed 400 pounds.\
      \  Those days are behind me.  Over the course of a year and a half beginning\

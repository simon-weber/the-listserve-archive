      <p>When I was about 3, I started learning to read and asked my older brother

      <p>02. Understanding evolution</p>

      <p>That moment when the angels sing, the world around you fades to white and
      you''re in awe of all these small miracles... it happened to me when I finally
      understood the basic process of evolution.</p>

      <p>Are you confident you can explain evolution to a 10-year-old?</p>

      <p>It''s easy, it''s just a series of happy accidents. An error in the copying

      <p>These are some random stories from someone who lives in the US but wasn&#8217;t
      born here. Another immigrant from a former communist country, with other siblings
      living all around the world. Different perspectives enabled by somewhat open

      \ a local school. I was having a horrible morning. Remember how your prepubescent\
      \ classmates treated the substitute teacher when you were a kid? Well, I was\
      \ now THAT teacher. Needless to say, I was attempting to keep the class under\
      \ control but struggling to do so. I knew that if I was to make it through the\
      \ afternoon I needed a coffee. At lunch, I drove to a plaza about 10 minutes\
      \ away and got my caffeine fix. As I approached my car, I suddenly realized\
      \ that my keys were locked inside. Ugh. As was my cell phone. Ugh again. Panicked\
      \ and desperate, I hurried into a nearby McDonald\u2019s and approached the\
      \ man at the counter (who turned out to be the manager) and asked him if he\
      \ could call me a cab. I briefly explained my situation and I could tell from\
      \ his expression that he sympathized with my desperation. I was a little beyond\
      \ stressed at this point. When you are substitute teaching, you are basically\
      \ trying to make the best impression possible on every principal and school\
      \ you go to in the hopes that they will like you and that you may be one step\
      \ closer to landing a full time gig. Not showing up after lunch or being late\
      \ would put you in their bad books. So the manager hurried to the back to call\
      \ me a cab while I paced the restaurant. The clock was ticking. I had about\
      \ 10 minutes until the bell rang. I debated running but it being winter and\
      \ likely a long and icy jog back, I wouldn\u2019t make it in time. Several minutes\
      \ later he returned only to tell me that the cab company had put him on hold\
      \ and that he had then become disconnected. He was now back on hold again. No\
      \ cab was coming yet. Crap!\r\n\r\nI must have made some sort of terrified face\
      \ because without hesitation he grabbed his coat and said \u201CI will drive\
      \ you\u201D. So without a thought I followed him. In no time I was back at the\
      \ school with only a couple of minutes to spare before the bell. I thanked this\
      \ man endlessly for his kind gesture and to which he replied, \u201Cthat\u2019\
      s what McDonald\u2019s is for\u201D. Not just the Big Mac I guess.\r\n\r\nI\
      \ think back to this day often and it makes me happy. Happy that a total stranger\
      \ would care enough to help me out of a bind. I guess we may not be able to\
      \ solve all the world\u2019s problems in a day but we do have the power to put\
      \ a smile on someone else\u2019s face and make their day just a little bit brighter.\

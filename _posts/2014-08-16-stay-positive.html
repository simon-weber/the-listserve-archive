      \nRed Beans and Rice\r\n\r\n1 pound dry kidney beans         1/2 teaspoon cayenne\

      \ rice\r\n\r\nRinse and soak beans overnight\r\n\r\nHeat oil in skillet and\
      \ cook onion, bell pepper, garlic, and celery for\r\n3 to 4 minutes until the\
      \ onions are translucent.\r\n\r\nRinse beans and place in a large pot with the\

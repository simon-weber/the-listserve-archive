<p>Hey guys!</p>
<p>Today I want to talk about a place very special to my heart: the country of Albania.</p>
<p>This is probably the point you groan with boredom; that's it? That's our email of the day? An informational on some little country?</p>
<p>As an Albanian-American who was born there and has returned several times to fall in love with the nation all over again, I am hoping I can dissuade any preconceived notions you might have. Albania is a small Eastern European country in the Balkans that is directly north of Greece. It has a long history of occupations (ex: Italy,  the Ottoman Turks, etc.) and as such has an interesting fusion of a culture that blends old and new.</p>
<p>But let's get right into the heart of this. I urge you to GO visit. Take the path less traveled, this is what you'll find:</p>
<p>-A light-hearted, generous people (the role of the guest is an *extremely* important concept in Albanian culture - you will be in good hands)<br />-Pristine beaches with clear water on the Adriatic Sea (this will vary by location, but I am strongly encouraging you to go to Vlora for gorgeous beaches)<br />-Extremely affordable shopping and hotels (..seriously.)<br />-Good, simple Mediterranean food at alarmingly low prices (good bread + our own spin on cool tzatziki yogurt sauce + fresh salads, minimum. you especially need to try roast lamb here!)<br />-A penchant for music and dance, be it folk or techno<br />-Weddings galore. It's the Albanians' favorite excuse to celebrate and would be an unforgettable experience</p>
<p>And honestly? If there's even one year I advise you to uncover this gem of a place, it's now. 2012. It's the year of the Dragon. It's Albania's 100 year anniversary of independence. Et cetera et cetera. We're living in exciting times; go now.</p>
<p>Here's to good traveling, good food, and good people. Gezuar! Cheers!</p>

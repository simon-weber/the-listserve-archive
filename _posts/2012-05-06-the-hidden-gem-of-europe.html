    <p>Today I want to talk about a place very special to my heart: the country of
    Albania.</p>

    <p>This is probably the point you groan with boredom; that''s it? That''s our
    email of the day? An informational on some little country?</p>

    <p>As an Albanian-American who was born there and has returned several times to
    fall in love with the nation all over again, I am hoping I can dissuade any preconceived
    notions you might have. Albania is a small Eastern European country in the Balkans
    that is directly north of Greece. It has a long history of occupations (ex: Italy,  the
    Ottoman Turks, etc.) and as such has an interesting fusion of a culture that blends
    old and new.</p>

    <p>But let''s get right into the heart of this. I urge you to GO visit. Take the
    path less traveled, this is what you''ll find:</p>

    <p>-A light-hearted, generous people (the role of the guest is an *extremely*
    important concept in Albanian culture - you will be in good hands)<br />-Pristine
    beaches with clear water on the Adriatic Sea (this will vary by location, but
    I am strongly encouraging you to go to Vlora for gorgeous beaches)<br />-Extremely
    affordable shopping and hotels (..seriously.)<br />-Good, simple Mediterranean
    food at alarmingly low prices (good bread + our own spin on cool tzatziki yogurt
    sauce + fresh salads, minimum. you especially need to try roast lamb here!)<br
    />-A penchant for music and dance, be it folk or techno<br />-Weddings galore.
    It''s the Albanians'' favorite excuse to celebrate and would be an unforgettable
    experience</p>

    <p>And honestly? If there''s even one year I advise you to uncover this gem of
    a place, it''s now. 2012. It''s the year of the Dragon. It''s Albania''s 100 year
    anniversary of independence. Et cetera et cetera. We''re living in exciting times;
    go now.</p>

    <p>Here''s to good traveling, good food, and good people. Gezuar! Cheers!</p>

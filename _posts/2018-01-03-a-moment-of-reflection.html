    body: "It is very easy to get stuck into a daily routine. In that way you develop\
      \ engrained habits. This might even happen without you noticing it. So, try\
      \ to take some time answering the following questions to bring a moment of reflection\
      \ into your day.\r\n\r\nDoes your current occupation help in making the world\
      \ a better place? Does it fit your ethics? Do you have a clear image of your\
      \ own ethical system in your mind?\r\n\r\nWhat is the last time you lied? About\
      \ what? Was lying justified in this situation? Do you believe lying can be justified\
      \ in some situations, or is it always wrong?\r\n\r\nDo you ever overestimate\
      \ your abilities or knowledge? Does this ever cause problems? Is there a way\
      \ you can improve this?\r\n-> Google \"Dunning-Kruger effect\" for a theory\
      \ explaining that you often overestimate your abilities\r\n\r\nWhat small or\
      \ big habits do you have which (indirectly) influence the lives of other people?\
      \ Do they have a good or a bad influence on other people and the world in general?\r\
      \n-> Also try to think of the indirect influences. For example the decision\
      \ to eat a lot of meat influences the climate. Or a more recent one, if you\
      \ buy Bitcoins you may also influence the climate because of the increasing\
      \ energy demands of mining (Google \"Bitcoin energy use\")\r\n\r\n\r\nThese\
      \ are bigger reflective questions, but you can also incorporate smaller questions\
      \ in your daily life. These small moments of reflection can be plentiful; just\
      \ before going to bed, in the shower, on the train or whenever you find the\
      \ time. Self reflection can also be done on a bigger scale. Once a year it can\
      \ be wise to take a full weekend (or even longer) to reflect on the course your\
      \ life took that year. What made you happy that year? How can you consolidate\
      \ these moments of happiness? What made you unhappy? What can you change to\
      \ prevent this in the future?\r\n-> A nice way for changing habits is to write\
      \ them down as a \"resolution of change\" and reading them (aloud) every morning.\
      \ It will take time if the habit is deeply engrained, but even then you can\
      \ change is it if you are persistent.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\
      \n\r\nThis email also comes at an interesting moment for me personally. I'm\
      \ just back from an 8 month trip around Central Asia (the clich\xE9, home for\
      \ Christmas) and now I am looking for my first job. I am looking for a small\
      \ to mid-sized company in the engineering, design or consultancy sector (preferably\
      \ a combination of both, a design/engineering consultant). If anyone reading\
      \ this is looking for an analytic and creative mind to strengthen his/her company\

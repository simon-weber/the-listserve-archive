      \ I have for him will always be there, but I wouldn't mind it if I never had\
      \ to see his face again. Everyone around me says I am dealing with it gracefully\

      \ where we try our best to wear something we've made each day for the entire\
      \ month. If you're curious as to what I've been making you can find me via ig\
      \ search. I became a seamstress because at the age of 5 I always knew I wanted\
      \ to be a designer. My parents called me stubborn but I like to think of it\
      \ as determined. Not once in the next 25 years have I changed my mind. It\u2019\
      s pretty freaking amazing to take two dimensional pieces of fabric and fit them\
      \ together like a puzzle to create wearable art. Most importantly, I became\
      \ a seamstress because I didn't want to contribute to the cycle of fast fashion\
      \ and the unfair wages and living conditions of clothing factory workers.\r\n\
      \r\nIt's May, which doesn't mean much, unless you are counting down the days\
      \ to the Movement Festival in Detroit. If you are reading this and are planning\
      \ on going, message me. I always love meeting up with like-minded people.\r\n\
      \r\nLastly, if you've made it this far... all life matters. Even the ones you\

      \ feel like every other email I've read included those... but tip your waitress/bartender\

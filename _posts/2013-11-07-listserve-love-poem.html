<p>My blog is mainly religious poetry but here is my favorite love poem that I composed:</p>
<p>THE WHITEST MAN IN THE WORLD<br />LOVE RAP SONG</p>
<p>Like Hemingway drank his scotch,<br />Like dogs who want to sniff your crotch.<br />Like a mother who loves her babies,<br />Like when the doctor told you didn&#8217;t have rabies.<br />Like I only can love you.<br />Like kids wasting the day on their Playstation Three,<br />Like when you say &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing good on TV.&#8221;<br />Like America loves its guns,<br />Like when we watch Law &amp; Order reruns.<br />Like I only can love you.</p>
<p>Like Hillary still needs her Bill,<br />Like when you cried from that waxing from Brazil.<br />Like evangelicals love Tim Tebow,<br />Like when we dreamed we&#8217;d go to the carnival in Rio.<br />Like I only can love you.<br />Like I only can love you.</p>

<p>The Canadian version of Breaking Bad is kind of lame. It ends after he gets cancer and his treatment is totally paid for by the government.</p>

      <p>THE WHITEST MAN IN THE WORLD<br />LOVE RAP SONG</p>

      <p>Like Hemingway drank his scotch,<br />Like dogs who want to sniff your crotch.<br
      />Like a mother who loves her babies,<br />Like when the doctor told you didn&#8217;t
      have rabies.<br />Like I only can love you.<br />Like kids wasting the day on
      their Playstation Three,<br />Like when you say &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing
      good on TV.&#8221;<br />Like America loves its guns,<br />Like when we watch
      Law &amp; Order reruns.<br />Like I only can love you.</p>

      <p>Like Hillary still needs her Bill,<br />Like when you cried from that waxing
      from Brazil.<br />Like evangelicals love Tim Tebow,<br />Like when we dreamed
      we&#8217;d go to the carnival in Rio.<br />Like I only can love you.<br />Like
      I only can love you.</p>

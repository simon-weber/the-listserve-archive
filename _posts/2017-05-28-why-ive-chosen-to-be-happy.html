      \ person. I have a beautiful fiancee Sara that I love very dearly, I have been\
      \ with her for 5 years. I am great friends with her brother Jeremy who is more\
      \ like a brother to me now more than anything. I have two other friends Logan\

      \ how you are going to live each day.\r\n\r\nFor me, I\u2019ve chosen to stop\
      \ being cruel, spiteful, hateful, angry, and malicious. It hasn\u2019t helped\
      \ me in the 23 years I\u2019ve been alive. I know it\u2019s easier said than\
      \ done, but I\u2019ve just become so tired of being an angry person, even though\
      \ I have every right to be! I want to be happy, I want to be happy for my Mom\
      \ who is the best Mom I could have, I want to be happy for my fiancee, I want\
      \ to be happy for my friends. I want to set an example for everyone not for\
      \ some \u201CSelf-righteous\u201D quest for satisfaction, but because I am tired\
      \ of being filled with hate. Hate will kill you.\r\n\r\nOn a happy note one\
      \ of the things I have started doing is taking up new hobbies. One of them right\

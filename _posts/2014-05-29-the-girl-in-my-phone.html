      \ two girls I\u2019m indifferent toward were the only ones to show up. I entertained\
      \ them still with curry and ice cream. We ended up at bar. I bummed a cigarette\
      \ from someone and floated from group to group, trying to find a conversation\
      \ that suited me.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been telling my therapist I\u2019m trying\
      \ to be more social, but it\u2019s hard to force it when I\u2019m not feeling\
      \ on. I rarely feel on. He thinks I\u2019m choosing to be off, but I don\u2019\
      t think he\u2019s right because he\u2019s usually not.\r\n\r\nI sat at the bar\
      \ and tried my best to pay attention to the two girls from dinner perched beside\
      \ me. They were talking shit about someone\u2019s weight and I was fading away.\
      \ I pulled out my phone and texted Julie and asked her what she was doing. I\
      \ tried to play darts with some strangers, but it just wasn\u2019t working.\r\
      \n\r\nI left early and got into my bed tired and alone\u2014too alone to fall\
      \ asleep. Julie\u2019s name beeped on my phone.\r\n\r\nI hadn\u2019t heard Julie\u2019\
      s voice in a month or so\u2014when we met for the first and only time at a poetry\
      \ reading, and went to a museum together in the morning. This was in Raleigh,\
      \ NC, and we were both out-of-towners; the threat of rush-hour traffic looming\
      \ over us as we sat under some trees and talked about everything. I didn\u2019\
      t really expect anything to come from this chance encounter (I thought of kissing\
      \ her but didn\u2019t. She told me later that this conceived action of mine\
      \ would\u2019ve been \u201Ca bit forward\u201D).\r\n\r\nShe asked me a few weeks\
      \ later what my intentions were (a move I myself considered forward), and we\
      \ settled up with each other. Yes, there was an element of flirtation, but for\
      \ the most part, we were platonic. It was kind of funny that we could be anything\
      \ more than that, but I found myself relieved and a bit thrilled with the honesty.\
      \ Honesty was new for me.\r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t notice it walking home, but Julie\
      \ had responded to my simple, \u201Cwhat\u2019s up?\u201D text with a slew of\
      \ messages and a voice memo. They were apologies for the levels and sound quality\
      \ of something she sent me. I opened the file on my phone and held the speakers\
      \ close to my ear.\r\n\r\nThere was light guitar music, but it was her voice\
      \ that stuck to me. It felt like I was taking a hot shower after getting caught\
      \ in the rain. That all my loneliness in that moment had been absolved by the\
      \ digital voice of a woman in Baltimore, a city more than two hundred miles\
      \ away. It seemed silly: just a minute or so of her singing and playing guitar\
      \ into her phone, but it wasn\u2019t just that. Julie was singing and she was\
      \ singing for me. Unbelievable.\r\n\r\nI imagined her bedroom. Playing guitar\
      \ by herself. Singing a bit. Messing up. Deciding to record it and send it to\
      \ me. What her lips and throat looked like as the words fell out. If she closed\
      \ her eyes.\r\n\r\nI told her she shouldn\u2019t have sent it to me, which was\
      \ true. I told her I couldn\u2019t listen to anything else, and that was true\
      \ too\u2014nothing was as beautiful. After these past few days, I have it nearly\
      \ memorized. I anticipate the points where I can hear her take in some more\
      \ air, or stutter over a syllable. The parts that remind me she\u2019s human.\

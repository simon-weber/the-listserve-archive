  body: "1.\r\n\r\nHe is everywhere.\r\n\r\nLurking in the woodsmoke that fills the\
    \ house in winter, there's a memory of the first time we built a fire together.\r\
    \n\r\nCleverly tucked into the taste of cinnamon and cider, there's a memory of\
    \ us walking underneath the changing leaves, steaming mugs of autumn in our hands.\r\
    \n\r\nSometimes, it's not so simple.\r\n\r\nSometimes, it's a whiff of cologne\
    \ in a crowd, and I am reminded of a shirt he used to own-- and the memory of\
    \ that shirt unlocks whole passages of time spent together I hadn't thought of\
    \ in years.  The images come flooding back; the porch we'd argue on, the bed we\
    \ slept in, the trip we planned for months and never took.\r\n\r\nYou know the\
    \ feeling: all it takes is one tiny thing, a domino, and a whole world of the\
    \ past tumbles into focus. Triggered by a smell.  A touch.  A song.\r\n\r\nMemory.\r\
    \n\r\n\r\n 2.\r\n\r\nLet's play a game.\r\n\r\nMy name is Olga Nunes. I'm a singer,\
    \ and for the past two years, I've been working on an album called LAMP.  LAMP\
    \ has a story woven around it, and I'd very much like for you to be a part of\
    \ that story.  \r\n\r\n\r\n 3.\r\n\r\nCall this number: 1.415.857.0589\r\n\r\n\
    It leads to a Google voicemail box; you can call it from anywhere.  When you call,\
    \ you will be asked a question.  Answer it.\r\n\r\n\r\n 4.\r\n\r\nI'll post those\
    \ answers to a blog just for this, and will make them part of the LAMP story.\r\
    \n\r\nFeel free to Google \"Olga Nunes LAMP\" to hear the songs, or see how this\
    \ has unfolded so far.\r\n\r\nI look forward to your call.\t\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Warmth,\
    \ \r\nOlga Nunes \r\nolga@olganunes.com \r\nSan Francisco, California\r\n\r\n\
    P.S. Just in case: if the number gives you a busy signal, try calling back. \r\

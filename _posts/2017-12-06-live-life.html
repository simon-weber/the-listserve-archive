      \ a surf competition before heading to his business meeting in La Jolla, CA.\r\
      \n\r\nTurns out that it wasn\u2019t a regular surf competition, but World Adaptive\
      \ Surfing Competition for athletes with physical challenges. My dad has always\
      \ been known to strike up a conversation with people in any situation and this\
      \ was no different. He starts telling me the story of Isamel, captain of the\
      \ Costa Rica team, who was a once a professional surfer before getting run over\
      \ by a bus. The doctors said he needed his legs amputated, but he refused. He\

      \ fear of strangers, especially from other cultures. Of course, not being a\
      \ cowboy about it is important, but with practice, trusting it\u2019s like a\
      \ muscle you flex.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these epic adventures, I\u2019m proud\
      \ to say \u201Cliving my best life\u201D and don\u2019t need to be traveling\
      \ in another country to do so. Now the challenge is to keep pushing past my\
      \ personal handicaps - work, bills, being tired and the list of excuses to LIVE\

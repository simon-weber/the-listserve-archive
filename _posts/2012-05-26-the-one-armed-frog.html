    <p>I was tree planting one year. While planting you need to move fast, the more
    trees in the ground the more money you would make. I was never all that great
    at it but I stuck with it and at the very least I kept going.</p>

    <p>One rainy day, on a hill surrounded by tree stumps and torn up branches, I
    threw my shovel into the ground to open up space in the dirt for a little tree
    but as the blade of my shovel came down a frog hopped onto the path. The shovel
    came down onto his shoulder.</p>

    <p>The frog&#8217;s arm was cut off. Not completely, though, there was a small
    flap of muscle/skin hanging on (if you&#8217;ve ever read Harry Potter, think
    of Nearly Headless Nick) and the frog was wriggling around on the ground, likely
    in a lot of pain.</p>

    <p>I was a little shocked. I stared at the frog a little while, and it never made
    a sound. I looked around, walking a few steps to see if someone was nearby. Probably
    for moral support, but I hadn&#8217;t really thought that far ahead. I didn&#8217;t
    know if I should try to kill the frog, knowing that with it&#8217;s injury it
    would be easy prey and have difficulty moving around to get it&#8217;s own food.
    I decided to go back to check on the frog.</p>

    <p>He was gone, somehow moving himself back into the brush. I still wonder if
    his arm wasn&#8217;t as bad as I thought. Either way, he''ll figure things out
    for himself.</p>

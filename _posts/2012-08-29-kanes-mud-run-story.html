<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Here is most embarrassing moment:</p>
<p>About 6 years ago, I entered a 6km run. It was over farmland, in muddy swamps, along very muddy farm tracks and crashing through bushes.</p>
<p>At the end of the race everyone was totally mud-covered.</p>
<p>I went through to the changing rooms. Now, I have never really played team sports or been to the gym much&#8230; so was not very used to, or comfortable with the communal nakedness that a changing room presents. I have always been a bit body conscious, but really I was just not used to public nakedness.</p>
<p>I manned up though and went for it. Luckily I was the only guy in the changing rooms at the time, so I had time to compose myself. I took a deep breath and stripped naked. I looked quite a sight, all covered in mud apart from where my clothes and just been.</p>
<p>I walked into the next room where the showers were.</p>
<p>Nervously&#8230;but with new found confidence.</p>
<p>I turned the corner and found all the showers were taken and&#8230;that I was the ONLY NAKED GUY IN THE ROOM!</p>
<p>Everyone else was still in their muddy shorts, cleaning them as they showered.</p>
<p>None of the showers were free and everyone felt very awkward about my naked presence.</p>
<p>All I had to protect my dignity was a bar of soap. But I had committed.</p>
<p>I stood staunch until someone finally broke ranks and left.</p>
<p>I take this opportunity to thank that stranger</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

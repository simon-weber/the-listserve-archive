      <p>I grew up on a dairy farm in Friesland, the Netherlands. Throughout our&#160;upbringing,
      my twin brother and I spent a lot of time together - building tree houses, doing

      <p>Most friendships from back home have watered down through time. I only see
      my twin brother when I go back to visit the farm, and many other friends I only
      see on special occasions. Fortunately, there is something that brings a group
      of us together every year: FarmFest.&#160;</p>

      <p>10 years ago a couple of friends and I decided to celebrate our birthdays
      together. We got some bands, lots of beers, and invited friends. Saturday July
      14th we will throw the tenth of these gatherings, which we named FarmFest. This
      festival has grown from a few dozen friends to more than 500 people, who come
      to listen to bands, bbq, drink beers, dance, and relax around bonfires. Every
      year we improve something: better audio, a larger tent, a second stage, more
      bands.</p>

      <p>Yet, the most pleasure I get from FarmFest is not the party itself, but the
      preparation. In the months and weeks before FarmFest my old friends, twin brother
      and I get together and try and figure out how to organise a festival. And let

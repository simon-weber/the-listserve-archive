    <p>Forgive the hyperbole. You see, I''ve found that people are more likely to

    Those are simply causes -- important ones, no doubt -- but in the end they''re

    <p><br />A premise: Western-style capitalistic society, as it exists in 2013,
    is directly or indirectly responsible for a significant proportion of humanity''s

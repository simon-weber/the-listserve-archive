<p>You just landed in India. You&#8217;re a bit stressed: it&#8217;s absolutely normal. But let me just tell you a simple thing, and everything will go just fine. In a matter of days, the Indian in you will be fully awakened.</p>
<p>The head tilt.</p>
<p>This is a very simple gesture: just tip your head from side to side with a small angle (around 15&#176;), repeatedly. Don&#8217;t make it start at the top of the head; your chin should be driving the movement. Limit yourself to three or four tilts, in a fluid movement. Got it? Yes, you&#8217;re doing it right.</p>
<p>You just learnt the secret to Indian communication. A stranger is talking to you in an unknown language? Just concur, using your newly learnt skill. Congratulations! You successfully communicated. Look at the visible satisfaction in your new friend&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>Huh? You still don&#8217;t understand what it means? You&#8217;re puzzled by this taxi driver&#8217;s use of the gesture when you give your destination? Was it &#8220;yes&#8221;, was it &#8220;no&#8221;?</p>
<p>No, you&#8217;re not getting it: it doesn&#8217;t have a meaning, because it IS the language. Does English have a meaning?</p>
<p>But the comparison with English stops here. The tilt head is much more powerful. What other language allows you to communicate &#8220;I reluctantly agree to the price you have given me, but be aware you get all my contempt&#8221; with such concision?</p>
<p>Warning: Excessive use of the tilt head may severely impair your communication skills back at home. Use at your own risk.</p>

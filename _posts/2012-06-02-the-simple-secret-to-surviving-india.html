    <p>The head tilt.</p>

    <p>This is a very simple gesture: just tip your head from side to side with a
    small angle (around 15&#176;), repeatedly. Don&#8217;t make it start at the top
    of the head; your chin should be driving the movement. Limit yourself to three
    or four tilts, in a fluid movement. Got it? Yes, you&#8217;re doing it right.</p>

    <p>You just learnt the secret to Indian communication. A stranger is talking to
    you in an unknown language? Just concur, using your newly learnt skill. Congratulations!
    You successfully communicated. Look at the visible satisfaction in your new friend&#8217;s
    eyes.</p>

    <p>Huh? You still don&#8217;t understand what it means? You&#8217;re puzzled by
    this taxi driver&#8217;s use of the gesture when you give your destination? Was
    it &#8220;yes&#8221;, was it &#8220;no&#8221;?</p>

    <p>No, you&#8217;re not getting it: it doesn&#8217;t have a meaning, because it
    IS the language. Does English have a meaning?</p>

    <p>But the comparison with English stops here. The tilt head is much more powerful.
    What other language allows you to communicate &#8220;I reluctantly agree to the
    price you have given me, but be aware you get all my contempt&#8221; with such
    concision?</p>

      \ pre-show buffet came with a free set of lawyers, and all phones, wallets,\
      \ etc. were locked up prior to entering the set. One contestant was almost kicked\
      \ out because he brought a book into the green room in case he got bored.\r\n\

      \ his emphasis on \"possibly\" gave me the impetus to puzzle out the right answer.\
      \ After the taping was over and I got back to my hotel, there were two phone\

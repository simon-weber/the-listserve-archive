      \ I actually won something! Feels great.\r\n\r\nSecondly; a brief introduction.\
      \ My name is Raoul, 26 y/o. Just finished doing the dishes.\r\nLiving in Holland.\
      \ Earning (some) money as a graphic designer.\r\nLike a lot of people on earth\
      \ I enjoy music, art, tasty food & beer, our sun and spending time with my friends/loved\
      \ ones.\r\n\r\nWhat I really love is combining everything together by visiting\
      \ (electronic) music festivals.\r\nNothing beats dancing in the sun together\
      \ with my friends & strangers. You should definitely visit one of the many outdoor\
      \ festivals in the Netherlands during summer, the vibe is always great. Try\
      \ visiting a small festival: better atmosphere, better music, smiles everywhere,\
      \ less commercial crap. I will name some DJ\u2019s, bands & other stuff I like\
      \ below. It\u2019s a bit of everything but worth checking out.\r\n\r\nMoving\
      \ on to probably my biggest passion, graphic design. I love making prints, shapes,\
      \ layouts, typography, drawing letters, silly characters. Although it\u2019\
      s hard for me making a living with graphic design at the moment I enjoy every\
      \ second making stuff. It\u2019s satisfying solving someone\u2019s design problem,\
      \ making information easily digestible and making people smile just by using\
      \ shapes and letters.\r\n\r\nAs a rookie designer, seeing the excellent work\
      \ of other designers is sometimes very intimidating. Still I keep on working\
      \ knowing at some point in life I will end up where I need to be. I am curious\
      \ if any of you readers are in a similar situation. Or even better, have been\
      \ there and in the end got exactly where they needed to be. Lemme know & show\
      \ your work.\r\n\r\nLike everyone else I can\u2019t help to end with some kind\
      \ of advice. All smart things have been said by other Listserve winners so I\
      \ think it\u2019s time for some dumb advice. Be weird! Do dumb shit but know\
      \ when to stop. Temporally alter your perception; can be done in numerous ways.\
      \ Put on your grandma\u2019s glasses and take a walk. Visit a rave! \u263A!\
      \ \u262E! Walk instead of taking the bus/car. Take a detour. Write down every\
      \ wacky idea you have, at night, under the shower, later it can turn out to\
      \ be a golden idea. Doing dumb things may seem dumb at first but can provide\
      \ a totally new way of looking at things. Try it sometime.\r\n\r\nPeace.\r\n\

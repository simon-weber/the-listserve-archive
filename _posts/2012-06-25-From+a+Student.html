<p>When I received the email telling me I could write a letter to 20,000 people, I smiled. The timing was hilarious.<br />The last four days have been the most amazing in my life... but that is a different story (you can ask me about it via email if you like).</p>
<p>After hours and hours of thought, this is a thank you, a thank you to all teachers who approach their jobs and roles with energy, sincerity and enthusiasm. Parents and community leaders too, but especially to those in high school education.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m one of those students... you most likely know the type.<br />The sort of student who loves to learn, but is much less thrilled with proving what I have learned.<br />You took the time, made the effort and encouraged me to persist, to be better, and even though my marks didn&#8217;t quite make it, you still taught me with the same passionate enthusiasm as always.</p>
<p>Just so you know - I&#8217;m 22 now - travelling the world, meeting new people, having exciting and challenging adventures.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m doing it with that exact same enthusiasm, sincerity and energy you used when you were teaching me some idea that flew right over my head.</p>
<p>On behalf of all students, thank you for your interest in our lives, and for sharing your passion.<br />I hope someday I can find the patience, wisdom and heart to do the same.</p>

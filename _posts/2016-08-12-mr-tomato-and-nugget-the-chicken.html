      \ of the subject line, comes from my experience working with an organization\
      \ called Amir (google Amir Project if you\u2019re interested).  My explanation\
      \ of the organization is that Amir uses informal garden education at summer\
      \ camps to teach kids about social justice.  Amir hires college students and\
      \ trains them to become Farmers at camps.  Of course, working with the organization\
      \ over two summers revealed that it was more than that.  I saw the organization\
      \ lay the groundwork to expand past summer camps, to year-round gardens.  The\
      \ work was fulfilling because I didn\u2019t just see the campers we worked with\
      \ grow and learn, but the Farmers as well.  I happened to be working at a camp\
      \ with a high tuition rate (about $5,000/month), with campers whose parents\
      \ could afford to shop at Whole Foods.  But that didn\u2019t halt their sense\
      \ of wonder when they saw a tomato plant in the garden for the first time or\
      \ picked their own chocolate mint and muddled it.\r\nDuring one of our discussions,\
      \ we used weeds as a metaphor for problems we encounter in real life, and discussed\
      \ how they could be weeded out.  This was followed by a removal of weeds from\
      \ our lettuce bed.  One of the young campers, 7 years old at the time, found\
      \ a tomato plant in the lettuce bed.  The other Farmer and I explained that\
      \ yes, that tomato plant was a weed in the lettuce bed, because we hadn\u2019\
      t planted it there on purpose.  The young camper wanted to keep it, though,\
      \ so we helped her transplant it to a wooden raised bed.  She named it Mr. Tomato.\
      \  When I came back for my second summer at camp, Mr. Tomato wasn\u2019t there,\
      \ but he had left seeds that grew into volunteers, so his family was there to\
      \ greet that camper.\r\nAnother program component was our animals.  The first\
      \ summer, we had ten chickens.  Like some of the plants, campers had not interacted\
      \ with chickens that were still clucking.  One of the older campers coined the\
      \ name Nugget for one of the hens, and made sure to walk by every day and say\
      \ \u201CHi\u201D to her.\r\nMy experience with this program was transformative.\

      \ of a connection with our food?  There will be ethical considerations, about\
      \ the use of pesticides, GMOs, or the labor that goes into food production.\
      \  But we can cut many of those out if we follow our food from seed to table.\

<p>I've been through a key moment of my life since April this year.<br />I had a strong spiritual experience that made me realize life as this huge adventure that you dont have any excuses besides enjoy it! I asked for an open heart and I received it, and now I have this mission to spread.</p>
<p>One of the tools is this new project which I'd like to introduce you:</p>
<p><br />THE MASSIVE HUMAN COLLABORATION PROJECT</p>
<p><br />MHCP develops products and content that we believe can make people's lives more joyful. We do so with an open heart, because our work is the reflection of what we are as people, our interface with the world.</p>
<p>MY CODE</p>
<p>Be incredibly fun<br />Be fair on you, so you will be fair on others<br />Strongly believe in what you are doing<br />Act by heart<br />Embrace creative freedom<br />Be fearless<br />Respect people<br />Don't put yourself below or above anything or anybody<br />Be brave, you need to stand up to a lot of people that just did not stop to think like you did<br />Be committed about doing differently<br />Think in a humanity scale<br />Be part of every minute of your life<br />Be responsible for everything single step you take</p>
<p>TAGS</p>
<p>Creativity<br />Technology<br />Art and Design<br />Education<br />Science<br />Doing GOOD<br />Building our own future</p>
<p>Drop me a line, let's connect!</p>
<p>I adore Listserve for the great people I get in touch with everyday, I've been learning a lot of good stuff with you guys.</p>
<p><br />Cheers!</p>

      <p>So, what to write?</p>

      <p>How about some honesty... something I have been keeping from myself for quite
      some time.</p>

      <p>--</p>

      <p>At the age of 24, I was handed my dream job. Barely out of college, and based

      going to be.... perfect.</p>

      <p>And so it was.</p>

      <p>But I didn''t appreciate it.</p>

      <p>I let things get in the way.</p>

      <p>I let EGO get in the way.</p>

      <p>~"Our budget has been stagnant for a decade! This is a reflection of their

      obviously hate me!"~<br />~"These alumni don''t like the Homecoming plans! They

      <p>I focused exclusively on everything that WASN''T working, and allowed myself

      <p>All the ensembles were growing!<br />MULTIPLE-times more performances than
      this school used to do!<br />NEW ensembles started!</p>

      <p>Heck, we CREATED and HOSTED one of the largest band festivals in US history!</p>

      <p>~"He doesn''t care how much work they''ve put in! He doesn''t care about

      <p>So I refused. I had the Band continue on, as rehearsed. And halftime went

    \ tend to do a great job bringing life stories of athletes from across the world\
    \ into your living rooms and getting you to not just care about how your respective\
    \ country is doing (Latvia\u2019s winning a gold medal in Men\u2019s skeleton,\
    \ you can quote me on that) but how important this chance of a lifetime is to\
    \ someone you\u2019ve never met.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been fortunate enough over the\
    \ last few years to get involved in writing about the winter sliding sports of\
    \ bobsled (or bobsleigh if you\u2019re not reading this in America), skeleton\
    \ and luge.  In that time I\u2019ve met some amazing athletes with amazing stories,\
    \ not just those who are at the Olympic level, but with so many other people working\
    \ hard to get to that level.  There are people who are working two and three jobs\
    \ just to support a dream to one day represent your country in the Olympics, and\
    \ the hard work and effort these men and women put in is definitely something\
    \ to applaud, even if they never do reach their dream.\r\n\r\nThe more you read\
    \ about people like Steven Holcomb, Elana Meyers, Noelle Pikus-Pace, John Daly\
    \ (the Olympian, not the golfer, though I guess him too), Erin Hamlin and folks\
    \ like that, you\u2019ll likely find yourself more motivated to try to accomplish\
    \ things you dream about.  Personally, learning about their selflessness, hard\
    \ work and determination led me to try to better myself.  I\u2019ve lost 55 pounds\
    \ since April, have started learning some German and have really tried to not\
    \ let \u201CI can\u2019t\u201D be something I deal with anymore.\r\n\r\nAs Sochi\
    \ 2014 comes inching closer and closer, please take the time to support your Olympians\
    \ and National Team members in various sports.  They\u2019ll appreciate it far\

    \r\nA few other things:\r\n- If you\u2019re looking to get a pet, make sure you\
    \ check out your local shelter or rescue organization first.  My boston terrier,\
    \ Deacon, is amazing, showed up crate trained and house broken and is by far the\
    \ best dog I\u2019ve ever had.  Why not help a poor little guy or girl out and\
    \ make both of your lives better in the process?!\r\n- If you have one motorsports\

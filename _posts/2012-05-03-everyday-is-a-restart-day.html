<p>Hi everyone,<br />Today I&#8217;m taking a mental health day.  At least, that&#8217;s what I call them.  Sometimes I need a break.  Especially at this time of the year, because it&#8217;s the end of the semester and I have so much to do and I haven&#8217;t been eating as healthy as I could or exercising as much as I like or sleeping as much as I need.<br />I&#8217;m an ambitious, busy, independent person.  It&#8217;s really hard for me to admit that I need breaks.  But I&#8217;m admitting it to all 13,226 of you (yes, I just checked) because I want you to feel okay about it admitting it, too.   Taking the time out to recharge your batteries is often very productive &#8211; it gives you the clear mind and the energy you need to tackle your next great project.<br />I have a lot of things I need to do tomorrow, and the day afterward.  I have a hundred things I want to do in the near future.  But today, I need a break, and I&#8217;m doing the things that make me feel healthy and happy.  Before I go out and conquer the world or something.<br />Before I go, a really fantastic high school student asked me to tell you this: &#8220;Everyday is a Restart Day.&#8221;  Today, I&#8217;m restarting &#8211; I&#8217;m eating well, exercising, and getting a full night&#8217;s rest before I embark on tomorrow&#8217;s journey.  And that is perfectly okay.</p>

      \ are, those that tell stories...and those that get paid to tell stories.\r\n\
      \r\nWho want's to hear your story?  I\u2019ll tell you...\r\n\r\nFirst, let\
      \ me ask you some tough questions\u2026\r\n\r\nHonestly, they might make you\
      \ uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nAll I ask is that you read the questions, ask them of\
      \ yourself, and be honest.\r\n\r\nYou ready?\r\n\r\nOK, here we go\u2026\r\n\
      \r\nHow is the next year of your life going to be different from this one?\r\
      \nHere\u2019s the deal\u2026if you have been reading about everyone else's story,\
      \ reading books, and watch documentaries, you are probably where they were just\
      \ a few years ago.\r\n\r\nYou dream of living a better life, but you feel like\
      \ you are spinning your wheels...\r\n\r\nMaybe you blog a little\u2026.Your\
      \ email list is growing slowly, if at all. Your writing is even slower. You\
      \ don\u2019t feel like you are reaching the world with your message.\r\n\r\n\
      Well, the good news is that you can change that!\r\n\r\nBut how?\r\n\r\nThat\
      \ brings us to question two\u2026\r\n\r\nDo you have a plan?\r\nSeriously, do\
      \ you have a plan in mind to make this year better than last year?\r\n\r\nAre\
      \ you just making it up as you go? Chasing every new shiny object that comes\
      \ your way.\r\n\r\n...spending all your time looking for \u201Ctricks\u201D\
      \ and \u201Ctools\u201D that barely move the needle, when what you need is a\
      \ PLAN.\r\n\r\nWhat options do you have?\r\n\r\nOne option:\r\nPublish a book.\
      \  People out there are willing to PAY for your everyday, walk around knowledge.\r\
      \n\r\nYou heard me right. (not a typo)\r\n\r\nI'm talking about writing a non-fiction\
      \ book and promoting it online...I have people ask me all the time if they can\
      \ actually make money selling short ebooks online, and my answer is without\
      \ hesitation, YES.  I enjoy helping people with it too.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s\
      \ a simple way you can get in the \u201Cback door\u201D of major book websites...and\
      \ get featured online, if you know how.\r\n\r\nMy friend started out as a dead-broke\
      \ bread distributor, and created a short e-book that he put up on a website\
      \ for $2.99 and through some simple marketing, he sold over 65,000 ebooks online.\r\
      \n\r\nHe quit his job.  Spends more time with his family.  Started writing more\
      \ books.  Helping more people.\r\n\r\nIs it easy?  No.\r\n\r\nIs it worth it?\
      \  I think so\u2026.but, you\u2019ve got to answer that for yourself.\r\n\r\n\
      Anything worthwhile takes effort.  I just helped another guy get to #1 best\
      \ seller on Amazon right before Christmas\u2026.it\u2019s fun to help people\
      \ share their message.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019ve got the ability and freedom to write\
      \ (even if you\u2019re not very good) and make a living for yourself online.\r\
      \n\r\nGo for it.  I believe everyone has a unique story and path that God has\
      \ put them on that can inspire and help someone else.\r\n\r\nI'd like to hear\
      \ from you, even if you feel like you have a book in you but have no idea what\
      \ you'd write it about.\r\n\r\nWhat is your story?\r\n\r\nReply with #Listserve\

    body: "So the story goes.....A little bird was flying south for the winter. It\
      \ was so cold that the bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field.\
      \ While he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him. As the\
      \ frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to realize how warm\
      \ he was. The dung was actually thawing him out! \r\nHe lay there all warm and\
      \ happy, and soon began to sing for joy. A passing cat heard the bird singing\
      \ under the pile of cow dung and promptly dug him out and ate him.\r\n\r\nMoral\
      \ of the story:\r\n\r\n(1) Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy. \r\n\
      (2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend. \r\n(3) If you are\
      \ happy and warm in a pile of shit then it's smart to keep your mouth shut!\r\
      \n\r\n.........and the doctor recommends (I really am one) :-\r\n\r\n1) Make\
      \ an effort to smile everyday, it will help you live longer.\r\n2) Don't forget\
      \ how to use a pen. 2) Enjoy your single malt scotch as it was intended...straight\
      \ and unadulterated. 3) Take time to sit with your eyes closed for atleast 10\
      \ minutes...it will open up your mind. \r\n4) Read IF by Rudyard Kipling and\
      \ Auguries of Innocence by Wiliam Blake.\r\n5) Everything will be alright at\
      \ the end, if it's not alright then it's not the end\r\n\r\nLive long and prosper\

<p>here is something that i have worked on for a long time.<br />you can sort out the proportions to taste, but it will make you a solid bloody maria.<br />even in south sudan you can find most of these things.<br />you may need to sneak the tomato juice in, or use ceres.<br />i have not put in proportions, but have listed these things in order of importance/operation/process. it's art. deal.<br />if you hate things that taste good you can substitute vodka for tequila</p>
<p>juba / 2012<br />==================================</p>
<p>make this recipe backwards, from the bottom up.</p>
<p>tequila (don't put this in until even after you've put in the juice(s)) -- and then - put a lot in.</p>
<p><br />1/2 cambell's tomato juice<br />1/2 clamato juice<br />(essentially, try to mix a heavy and light juice.  If not, add some water or water and lemon. i haven't found either of those juices here in south sudan but it hasn't stopped me yet.  don't put juices in until the very end.)</p>
<p><br />(the main bit</p>
<p>below:</p>
<p>take all these things and slice them up.</p>
<p>then put in the stuff above)</p>
<p>dash of oj or other citrusy juice (lemon)<br />black pepper<br />salt<br />worstchire sauce<br />onions (half shaved and half cut)<br />grated radish (good luck finding this)<br />chopped basil (or other similar smelly green herb)<br />chili pepper flakes<br />ground cayenne pepper<br />powdered ginger (or grated fresh)<br />pickle juice<br />pickled things (like pickled beans, for example. slice very thin) (if you don't have, skip or make your own pickles)<br />wasabi (get in a tube from nairobi)<br />horseradish (steal from fancy hotel in capetown.)<br />dijon mustard (or equivalent)</p>
<p><br />that's it. enjoy</p>

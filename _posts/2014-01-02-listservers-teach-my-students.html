      \ collect short video messages from you, introducing a slice of your life in\
      \ whatever place you live.  It could be a local custom or festival that you're\
      \ participating in, you could introduce the work that you do, or a hobby.  Or\
      \ it could be as simple as showing us an interesting place in your town, or\
      \ a local food.  It\u2019s up to you.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't need to be long or complicated,\
      \ and it doesn't need to be edited.  Just a quick video that you shot with your\
      \ cell phone camera is fine.  But however you do it, I have some requests:\r\
      \n\r\n1. Please include a greeting to my students, to grab their attention and\
      \ make it personal: the town's name is Kurobe (pronounced \"koo-RHO-bay\") and\
      \ the school is Sakurai (\"SOCK-oo-rye\") Junior High School.\r\n2. Introduce\
      \ yourself!  Please tell us your name and where you're from, and anything else\
      \ you'd like to share about yourself (age, birthday, job, interests, favorite\
      \ movie, etc.)\r\n3. Please pick something to introduce that you can SHOW us\
      \ on the video!  Having a visual to go along with the explanation will make\
      \ it much easier to understand.\r\n4. Please speak clearly and a little slower\
      \ than your natural conversational speed.\r\n\r\nSend your videos to me at LawrenceSensei@gmail.com\
      \ either directly attached to the email, or send me a link to it on dropbox/google\
      \ drive/yousendit/etc.\r\n\r\nThat's it!  All in all, it shouldn't take more\
      \ than a few minutes of your time, and it would be really fun for my students\
      \ to get personalized video messages from around the world.\r\n\r\nBUT WAIT,\
      \ THERE\u2019S MORE!  It's not fair for you to just give your valuable time\
      \ to my students and get nothing back, so here's the really cool part: every\
      \ year we do a project in which my students make English commercials to advertise\
      \ a local food or shop.  If this idea works, though, I\u2019d like to slightly\
      \ alter that project and have them make video responses to your messages!  So,\
      \ if you\u2019re kind enough to send us a video, you\u2019ll get one back!\r\
      \n\r\nDisclaimers: I just came up with this idea in the last 24 hours, and although\
      \ I run my classes, I don't have total control over what we can do.  I\u2019\
      ll have to OK this idea with my supervisors.  I think it should be fine, but\
      \ there\u2019s a chance that it won't be\u2014in which case, I apologize in\
      \ advance.  Also, if we are able to do it, there are a lot of people on this\
      \ Listserve.  While I'm sure not everyone will respond and send us a video,\
      \ we still might get more than we can handle.  If we\u2019re unable to make\
      \ a response for every individual message we receive, I\u2019ll at least send\
      \ a personal email to apologize and thank you for your time.  I\u2019ll also\
      \ send mass emails to everyone who contributes with updates on how the project\
      \ is going.\r\n\r\nPlease email me with any questions, too!\r\n\r\nThank you,\

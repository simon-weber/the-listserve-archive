      <p>I''m on year six of raising my children alone. Eight are still at home. For
      years I languished. Stuck. Broken. But my kids kept growing. All these dreams
      I''ve had for us, for me, didn''t end because my marriage ended, or I couldn''t
      finance them or find time to breathe life into them. They ended because I gave
      up on them; resigned myself to the fact that life was always going to be hard.
      So, I put my dreams on paper and figured out what I needed to do to make them
      happen. I wrote down what it would feel like to accomplish them. I''m not talking
      about buying stuff or jetting around the world. I''m talking about living!</p>

      <p>And yesterday, exhausted, I almost gave in and slept. Then I saw this pinned
      to the board above my desk: &#8220;Don''t give up what you LOVE most for what
      you WANT now.&#8221; My bucket list contains one item: I want to live someplace
      beautiful. Everything else will fall into place from there. Taking a nap in
      the miserable heat won''t get me there. But knocking out that research paper;
      boxing up clutter to sell/give away; and snuggling with my kids, talking about
      our first winter in the snow gets me closer. Going to bed early last night with
      the kids helped, too.</p>

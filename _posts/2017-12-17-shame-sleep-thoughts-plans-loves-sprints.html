      \ email, take this:\r\n\r\n* Never let shame dictate your life. Never suffer\
      \ in silence. Never push people away without letting them understand what's\
      \ happening. Allow yourself to be vulnerable and to show those vulnerabilities\
      \ to people around you, trust that they will understand and accept their help.\
      \ You will be surprised by their kindness. And they need your help too.\r\n\r\
      \nIf you'll stay with me for a few more:\r\n\r\n* Try your hardest to get enough\
      \ sleep, and to sleep during hours that work decently with the rest of society.\
      \ Being awake when noone else is and sleeping when noone else is causes distance\
      \ and isolation. Being constantly tired saps the happiness from everything and\

      \ If you think about something constantly, then you should probably act on it\
      \ in some way. A challenge is figuring out what that action should be, but a\
      \ thought that keeps returning will often require a resolution of some kind.\r\
      \n\r\n* If there's something you want to do, pick a date for it. If you have\

      \ letting time pass by.\r\n\r\n* Make some short lists of things you love, and\
      \ keep them in a safe place. A few foods, a few songs, a few books, a few movies,\

      \ need them the most.\r\n\r\n* If you are able, make sure to raise your pulse\

      <p>Everyone has a story, and everyone learned things along the way that they
      wish they had known (or known the very real importance of) at the outset of

      <p>If you take *nothing* else from this email, take this:</p>

      <p>* Never let shame dictate your life. Never suffer in silence. Never push
      people away without letting them understand what''s happening. Allow yourself

      <p>* Try your hardest to get enough sleep, and to sleep during hours that work
      decently with the rest of society. Being awake when noone else is and sleeping
      when noone else is causes distance and isolation. Being constantly tired saps

      <p>* Make some short lists of things you love, and keep them in a safe place.

      \ unified circling of the mopeds, the sweet smells of grilled sticky rice, and\
      \ the dazzling flower-shaped lights together shared a story of Vietnam that\
      \ was equally exhilarating and comforting. At that moment, nothing else mattered\

      \ My parents came to the US after escaping the horrors of the Vietnam War. Instead\

      \ boat people to my mother's early entrepreneurial spirit selling beef jerky\
      \ to raise money to leave the war-ridden country.  If you haven't seen the Google\
      \ commercial called \"Graduation,\" about the Vietnamese immigrant struggle,\
      \ you should. That's my mom. Makes me tear every time.\r\n\r\nLife's difficult\
      \ sometimes, but I'm trying to make the best of it, not only for myself but\
      \ my family. My parents would support me regardless of my career choice, but\
      \ as a first generation Asian American, I am still responsible for taking care\

      \ was 8 pm. I almost fell asleep in the elevator. This is leading to something.\

      \ a bottle of scotch. I felt small, quiet, so I promised to myself that I\u2019\
      d reach the summit someday when I\u2019m not off an overnight Vegas bender,\
      \ with proper gear and a lung cleaner of tar. That was New Year's.\r\n\r\n3.\r\
      \nI could never see myself living in New York. I\u2019ve got so many ghosts\

      \ a smaller, cleaner take on that city, brutally cold but with humble Midwestern\

      \ a scrap of paper with a Khalil Gibran quote that's still sticky in the back\

      \ how much of that was a crock. I write a lot for social media. I goad myself\
      \ into calling what I do \u201Ccommercial art\u201D, that the kind of writing\

      Mental illness has me convinced I'm living a massive prank. Whenever I have\

      \ darker corners. But I'm better than them. I can love until loving grows ragged.\
      \ Until rain tears down sewers, until the front door goes creaky. I can care.\r\
      \n\r\n7.\r\nThe odd, misshapen hollowness pulling at me will fill. I\u2019m\

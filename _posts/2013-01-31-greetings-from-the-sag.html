    body: "I\u2019ve been dreading this since the day I joined the Listserve \u2013\
      \ that fateful day when the email would come telling me I was selected. I\u2019\
      ve been wracking my brain thinking about anything to write and I hope I\u2019\
      m writing something that will benefit someone \u2013 anyone, really. Even myself.\r\
      \n\r\nWhen I got that email I had two thoughts: The first one was, \u201Coh,\
      \ two listserves in one day? Weird!\u201D then, upon figuring out what the email\
      \ actually was, I said out loud (and in the middle of a meeting, mind you),\
      \ \u201COh! No way!!\u201D\r\n\r\nI guess that kind of brings me to the theme\
      \ of what I wanted to talk about \u2013 but first! \u2013 a quick shout out\
      \ to my \u201Cbestie\u201D Julia - the Juice - who introduced me to the ListServe\
      \ a while back and we\u2019ve been addicted to it ever since.\r\n\r\nSo why\
      \ was I looking at my email during a meeting? Because I hate my job. Well, not\
      \ really my job as much as my career path. I\u2019ve always been in Management\
      \ Consulting but I\u2019ve never ACTUALLY liked it. I enjoyed the concept of\
      \ traveling, talking to people, and (through several experiences in Africa)\
      \ helping people towards a larger purpose. I constantly read about stories of\
      \ people on the Listserve who\u2019ve taken action to DO something with their\
      \ lives and even have PASSIONS about/towards things. Julia and I talk about\
      \ this on a regular basis \u2013 we\u2019re always complaining to each other\
      \ about how much we hate our jobs and how we should ACTUALLY do something about\
      \ it but we never actually do.\r\n\r\nSo, I read somewhere that the most successful\
      \ people in life have become that way by taking life-altering risks. From your\
      \ Jobs to your Gates to your Zuckerberg; they\u2019ve all taken incredible risks\
      \ to get to where they want to be. I don\u2019t know about you, but when I walked\
      \ out of the Social Network I was kicking and screaming because I was quite\
      \ jealous (read: hating). I felt like I needed to do SOMETHING to make a fundamental\
      \ change in my life and I got all passionate and excited about it on the drive\
      \ home. One bowl of cereal and an episode of Entourage later, I had forgotten\
      \ it. It still gnaws at the back of my mind and every day the desire to be independent\
      \ and self-sufficient grows more and more. But then I think of something else\
      \ \u2013 were those individuals ACTUALLY passionate about what they invested/risked\
      \ everything for? Or was it just a good idea that they decided to implement\
      \ in the hopes of it being a money-making endeavor? Or, in the words of Butch\
      \ Warren, did they just have the \u201Cbest of luck\u201D?\r\n\r\nSo I guess\
      \ this is my invitation to you \u2013 I would be thrilled if you could send\
      \ me your stories/experiences of getting off your butts to ACTUALLY do something\
      \ that helped you take control of your life. I\u2019m asking for the advice\
      \ of 21,000+ people of how you discovered your passions and how you got yourself\
      \ to do something about them. That would be bitchin\u2019.\r\n\r\nA quick shout-out\
      \ to my wife, Dina, the love of my life. Without her, I\u2019d be a mess of\
      \ a man with no direction in life. Throughout all my doubts and fears, she\u2019\
      s been nothing but a loving and supportive partner.\r\n\r\n\r\nOmar Khedr\t\r\

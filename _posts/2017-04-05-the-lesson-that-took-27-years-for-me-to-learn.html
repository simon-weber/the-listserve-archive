    body: "I used to have a lot of friends. I don\u2019t anymore.\r\n\r\nI know what\
      \ you\u2019re going to say\u2026\u201DOh, honey, don\u2019t be so hard on yourself.\
      \ It\u2019s a circumstance of growing older, of moving to a different city.\
      \ It\u2019s just life\u2026people will come into it and people will go.\u201D\
      \r\n\r\nNope. I know exactly how I lost my friends.\r\n\r\nThree years ago,\
      \ I started a business. If you haven\u2019t done it before, I will give you\
      \ a brief synopsis of what it\u2019s like: it\u2019s a lot of work.\r\n\r\n\
      Three months ago, I went to a trade show, and after a meeting, a woman leaned\
      \ over and asked, \u201CHow old are you?\u201D I thought she asked this because\
      \ I was younger than most people at the trade show and owned a million dollar\
      \ business. I responded, \u201CTwenty-seven, but this business has given me\
      \ a few wrinkles on my face!\u201D She nodded enthusiastically and said, \u201C\
      Yes, definitely!\u201D\r\n\r\nAnd that lady probably has no friends, but for\
      \ an entirely different reason than I do.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t have friends because\
      \ I stopped caring about my friends. I put what was happening in my life over\
      \ what was happening in theirs. They\u2019d ask if I wanted to meet them for\
      \ drinks. \u201CCan\u2019t,\u201D I\u2019d text back. \u201CGotta work on my\
      \ business \u2639\u201D. They\u2019d call and leave voicemails that I\u2019\
      d never return. They\u2019d send me an email telling me that their beloved grandfather\
      \ died and they were really struggling and missed him every single day. I never\
      \ responded. I was too busy.\r\n\r\nNo. That last one actually didn\u2019t happen.\
      \ Well, it kind of happened. A few weeks ago, I sent an email to my friend to\
      \ let her know that my beloved grandfather died and I was so sad and I didn't\
      \ know I could ever miss someone so much. My friend didn\u2019t respond to my\
      \ email.\r\n\r\nAnd that was the moment when I realized I didn\u2019t have friends.\r\
      \n\r\nIf you\u2019re a good friend, people respond to that email. They call\
      \ you up and say, \u201CAre you okay?\u201D They send flowers.\r\n\r\nSo the\
      \ big lesson I\u2019ve learned at age 27 is\u2026 that I\u2019m a terrible person\
      \ because I\u2019ve been a terrible friend. No, just kidding. Absolutely not!\
      \ What I\u2019ve learned is a lesson about sacrifice. I chose my business over\
      \ my friends. I made that choice. Everything you do in life involves a sacrifice.\r\
      \n\r\nIf you respond to that email, you can\u2019t get started on that business.\
      \ If you go out for drinks, you may not write that book. People always want\
      \ to glamorize people who are successful and very rarely recognize the sacrifices\
      \ they make to get there.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think anyone \u201Chas it all\u201D\
      . Maybe the best you can have in life is a feeling that you\u2019ve made the\
      \ right sacrifices. I didn\u2019t call my friends back. But no matter how busy\
      \ I was with my business, I always called my grandfather. I always went to visit.\
      \ I always stayed for as long as I could and afterwards, I always wrote down\
      \ his stories.\r\n\r\nFor three months, my grandfather has been gone. For three\
      \ years, my friends have gone. Did I make the right sacrifices? I don\u2019\
      t know.\r\n\r\nI just know I miss one a lot more than the other.\r\n\r\n*******************************************\r\
      \nPS. I always said that if I won the Listserve I\u2019d ask for a pen pal.\
      \ I didn\u2019t know what else I would write alongside it, but this piece will\
      \ probably weed out a lot of people. If you\u2019re interested, please send\
      \ me an email and maybe we can be (pen) pals!\r\n\r\n\r\nMonique\r\nMontclair,\

    body: '<p>I used to have a lot of friends. I don&#8217;t anymore.</p>

      <p>I know what you&#8217;re going to say&#8230;&#8221;Oh, honey, don&#8217;t
      be so hard on yourself. It&#8217;s a circumstance of growing older, of moving
      to a different city. It&#8217;s just life&#8230;people will come into it and
      people will go.&#8221;</p>

      <p>Nope. I know exactly how I lost my friends.</p>

      <p>Three years ago, I started a business. If you haven&#8217;t done it before,
      I will give you a brief synopsis of what it&#8217;s like: it&#8217;s a lot of
      work.</p>

      <p>Three months ago, I went to a trade show, and after a meeting, a woman leaned
      over and asked, &#8220;How old are you?&#8221; I thought she asked this because
      I was younger than most people at the trade show and owned a million dollar
      business. I responded, &#8220;Twenty-seven, but this business has given me a
      few wrinkles on my face!&#8221; She nodded enthusiastically and said, &#8220;Yes,
      definitely!&#8221;</p>

      <p>And that lady probably has no friends, but for an entirely different reason
      than I do.</p>

      <p>I don&#8217;t have friends because I stopped caring about my friends. I put
      what was happening in my life over what was happening in theirs. They&#8217;d
      ask if I wanted to meet them for drinks. &#8220;Can&#8217;t,&#8221; I&#8217;d
      text back. &#8220;Gotta work on my business &#9785;&#8221;. They&#8217;d call
      and leave voicemails that I&#8217;d never return. They&#8217;d send me an email
      telling me that their beloved grandfather died and they were really struggling
      and missed him every single day. I never responded. I was too busy.</p>

      <p>No. That last one actually didn&#8217;t happen. Well, it kind of happened.
      A few weeks ago, I sent an email to my friend to let her know that my beloved
      grandfather died and I was so sad and I didn''t know I could ever miss someone
      so much. My friend didn&#8217;t respond to my email.</p>

      <p>And that was the moment when I realized I didn&#8217;t have friends.</p>

      <p>If you&#8217;re a good friend, people respond to that email. They call you
      up and say, &#8220;Are you okay?&#8221; They send flowers.</p>

      <p>So the big lesson I&#8217;ve learned at age 27 is&#8230; that I&#8217;m a
      terrible person because I&#8217;ve been a terrible friend. No, just kidding.
      Absolutely not! What I&#8217;ve learned is a lesson about sacrifice. I chose
      my business over my friends. I made that choice. Everything you do in life involves
      a sacrifice.</p>

      <p>If you respond to that email, you can&#8217;t get started on that business.
      If you go out for drinks, you may not write that book. People always want to
      glamorize people who are successful and very rarely recognize the sacrifices
      they make to get there.</p>

      <p>I don&#8217;t think anyone &#8220;has it all&#8221;. Maybe the best you can
      have in life is a feeling that you&#8217;ve made the right sacrifices. I didn&#8217;t
      call my friends back. But no matter how busy I was with my business, I always
      called my grandfather. I always went to visit. I always stayed for as long as
      I could and afterwards, I always wrote down his stories.</p>

      <p>For three months, my grandfather has been gone. For three years, my friends
      have gone. Did I make the right sacrifices? I don&#8217;t know.</p>

      <p>I just know I miss one a lot more than the other.</p>

      <p>*******************************************<br />PS. I always said that if
      I won the Listserve I&#8217;d ask for a pen pal. I didn&#8217;t know what else

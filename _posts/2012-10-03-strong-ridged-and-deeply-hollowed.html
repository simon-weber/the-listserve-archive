    <p>First, I have been reading the listserve every day for a few months now, and
    I want to express my disillusion at what I''ve seen. Far too many of the messages
    I receive from the listserve spew the same clich&#233;s that I have been listening
    to my whole life. Please, if you''re given this gift, tell me a story, introduce
    me to your favorite musician, tell me about your startup, tell me a joke! Show
    me what makes you individual.</p>

    <p><br />My second request is this: read more poetry.</p>

    <p>Scheherazade</p>

    <p>Tell me about the dream where we pull the bodies out of the lake<br />                                         and
    dress them in warm clothes again.<br />       How it was late, and no one could
    sleep, the horses running<br />until they forget that they are horses.<br />            It&#8217;s
    not like a tree where the roots have to end somewhere,<br />       it&#8217;s
    more like a song on a policeman&#8217;s radio,<br />         how we rolled up
    the carpet so we could dance, and the days<br />were bright red, and every time
    we kissed there was another apple<br />                                                                       to
    slice into pieces.<br />Look at the light through the windowpane. That means it&#8217;s
    noon, that means<br />        we&#8217;re inconsolable.<br />                            Tell
    me how all this, and love too, will ruin us.<br />These, our bodies, possessed
    by light.<br />                                                     Tell me we&#8217;ll

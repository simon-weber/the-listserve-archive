      \n\r\n-- AK-47: (Yeah, guns, I know...meh.) The core design of the AK-47 & derivatives\
      \ has barely changed in 70 years. They're legendarily robust & reliable. Their\
      \ endurance is down to the shocking simplicity of the core design. Google it;\

      \ along with a few design tweaks in the late 70s (like moving the pitch control\

      \ tool for messing around with vinyl in unintended, unexpected ways...\r\n\r\
      \n...which, through some pioneers experimenting, gave birth to turntablism:\
      \ scratching, cutting, sampling, mixing, remixing...\r\n...which gives us hip-hop.\r\
      \nOh, I wish I had more words to describe just how important that is to shaping\
      \ our modern cultures.\r\n\r\nThe SL-1200 (and 1210) inspired and allowed new\
      \ ways of playing music, blended playing with performing, redefining 'DJ', redefining\
      \ 'nightclub', shaping the evolution of electronic music, spawning a thousand\
      \ genres...the wheels of steel literally redefined what we call music.\r\n\r\
      \nEven when purpose-built competitors emerged, the SL-1200 endured because of\

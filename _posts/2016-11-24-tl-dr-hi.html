      \ message was even sent.  I see people get their chance as soon as a day or\
      \ two after joining, while I waited and wondered if I would ever be chosen as\
      \ the list grew to over 21,000 (21,969 as of this writing.)\r\n\r\nI thought\
      \ about that and was going to write a message so I could have it ready.  I really\

      \ AWESOME!)\r\n\r\n\u2026 how (years before the election) I was looking into\

      \ how you might not think college is worth it, however, lots of recruiters use\
      \ the lack of a college diploma as a tool to weed out people applying for a\
      \ job.  They might have a stack of 100 people for one job, so they put them\
      \ into two stacks, those with a diploma and those without. Then they take the\
      \ ones without a diploma and immediately reject them.  This has happened to\
      \ me numerous times, and I have had recruiters/HR people tell me that is the\

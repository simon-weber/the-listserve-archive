<p>1. Get a cat.<br />2. Never ever believe that your dreams aren't possible.<br />3. But don't assume you'll achieve them without working hard.<br />4. You are special.<br />5. Go ahead, say you don't like it. See how soon you start to like it after that. (My relationship with Mumford &amp; Sons)<br />6. Love your family, even the ones you don't like.<br />7. Have a good relationship with your siblings.<br />8. If someone throws a drink on you, hey a free drink.<br />9. Everybody needs a stuffed animal.<br />10. Volunteer, and actually listen.<br />11. Kill your tv.<br />12. Love yourself (even if you don't necessarily like yourself).<br />13. There are some things that will never change, same goes with people.<br />14. But there are some things and some people that will.<br />15. Life is a big grey area.<br />16. Watch Crash, if you haven't.<br />17. Give faith a chance.<br />18. I love all of you, and I don't have to know you to say that.</p>

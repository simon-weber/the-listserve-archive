      <p>Here are a few gems to brighten your day:</p>

      <p>A song: Zahav - Static and Ben El Tavori<br />I teach English in a middle
      school in Israel, and my students are currently obsessed with this song. They
      got me hooked after one listen. I regularly find myself dancing while walking
      down the streets, singing it to myself. Even if you don&#8217;t understand any
      of the Hebrew words, I know the melody will brighten your day. The music video
      is pretty cute, too.</p>

      <p>A quote: &#8220;Choose your attitude&#8221;.<br />At counselor orientation
      every summer at my overnight camp, the owner would repeat this important quote.
      I still think about it all the time. You can actively choose your attitude,
      how you approach and deal with problems in life. In every situation, and on
      every day, you can choose to remain positive. Make &#8220;Choose your attitude&#8221;
      your mantra.</p>

      <p>A book recommendation: Gift from the Sea by Anne Morrow Lindbergh.</p>

      <p>A poem: Hug O&#8217;War by Shel Silverstein</p>

      <p>I will not play at tug o&#8217; war.<br />I&#8217;d rather play at hug o&#8217;
      war,<br />Where everyone hugs<br />Instead of tugs,<br />Where everyone giggles<br
      />And rolls on the rug,<br />Where everyone kisses,<br />And everyone grins,<br
      />And everyone cuddles,<br />And everyone wins.</p>

      <p>A piece of advice: Write a journal. I&#8217;ve been journaling my thoughts
      since I was very young, and I&#8217;ve got a massive drawer full of journals
      now. Write about everything from the mundane activities of your daily life to
      your biggest hopes, dreams, and insecurities. You will never regret taking the
      time to journal. It&#8217;s never too late to start.</p>

      <p>And a final message: Everyone just wants to be loved. Show affection.</p>

      <p>Love,<br />Jenna</p>

      \ turn.  We were gearing up for a fun summer.  We had started the process of\
      \ looking at houses and, in fact, had an offer in on a house we loved (that\

      \ nearly three hours away from home at Vanderbilt in Nashville.\r\n\r\nShe\u2019\
      s long since lost her hair.  We are dealing with a plethora of meds, the side\

      \r\nI\u2019m working my way through dealing with this as a father, a husband,\

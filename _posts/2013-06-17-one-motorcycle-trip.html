    body: "In 2010, I & some friends decided to go to Leh in the Himalayas on our\
      \ motorcycles. We had been planning for months. 2 of us had even quit our jobs\
      \ just for this. Disaster struck the day before departure- Leh and all roads\
      \ leading there were struck by flash floods and heavy landslides killing and\
      \ stranding hundreds of people in that region. We were still in Delhi, still\
      \ about 400 miles to anywhere close to it.\r\n\r\nIf we had left even two days\
      \ before, we could have been trapped or killed but it felt like we were given\
      \ another opportunity to carry on our adventure. And so we did. That night we\
      \ decided to go to the neighboring Himalayan region of Lahaul-Spiti, an area\
      \ we had no idea about since all our planning was for Leh. All we had now was\
      \ a map in our hands.\r\n\r\nOur motorcycles were  small single-cylinder engines.\
      \ We were carrying only the basics for supplies and spares. We weren't really\
      \ prepared for rain but luck was on our side and we had beautiful weather throughout-\
      \ 2 days of rain out of 14 isn't bad! We just followed one road and it turned\
      \ out to be the two best weeks of my life, yet.\r\n\r\nMy only advice to anyone\
      \ \u2014 ride a motorcycle. Not because you can go fast or because it looks\
      \ \u201Ccool\u201D. But mainly because it can teach you many things and give\
      \ a new perspective towards life. That trip taught us several things. It taught\
      \ some to relax and not aim to see everything possible. It taught responsibility\
      \ by showing effects of alcohol on AMS. It taught us perseverance in the face\
      \ of deep-water crossings and quicksand-like mud. It taught us to celebrate\
      \ every obstacle and beautiful view that we came across. It taught us to stop\
      \ and smell the roses (we\u2019d stay a day longer if we liked a place). It\
      \ taught us to be best friends even when we barely knew each other. It taught\
      \ us to enjoy the simple pleasures of life- like a hearty breakfast or a glimpse\
      \ of vegetation! Most importantly, it kept us grounded. We were not keeping\
      \ score, racing against time, marking points on a map, trying to make deadlines\
      \ or writing magazine articles- just riding because we were enjoying it. If\
      \ there has been a time I've felt really \u2018free\u2019, that was it.\r\n\r\
      \nSo ride a motorcycle- every day if you can. It\u2019s a humbling but fun experience\
      \ once you get over your fears. Over the years motorcycling has taught me to\
      \ find peace in the chaos of a city without escaping it, to keep doing only\
      \ things that I love doing and most importantly, to stay real and true to myself.\
      \ For instance, I have been doing more non-profit work as a graphic designer-\
      \ because I got tired of brands misleading people giving them a false sense\
      \ of self-worth. I have even moved across the world to be with the woman I love.\
      \ Motorcycling has inspired my life in various other ways that\u2019s impossible\
      \ to list here.\r\n\r\nLike riding, Listserve proves that to be \u201Cwise\u201D\
      \ and \u201Cphilosophical\u201D, one doesn't need to be a spiritual guru or\
      \ have learned meditation techniques or read millions of books. All it takes\
      \ is their unique life experiences that everyone can learn from. The naysayers\
      \ just need to appreciate themselves a bit more.\r\n\r\nThank you Listserve\
      \ and everyone for reading and sharing your stories and beliefs. You are welcome\
      \ to visit my website (anuranjan-dot-com) to know me, my work, the trip or if\
      \ you want to simply connect for good food or go riding in NYC!\r\n\r\n\r\n\

<p>What happens when you win the lottery and you lose your ticket before you claim the prize? That's kind of what just happened to me...</p>
<p>Against all odds I was chosen to write to The Listserve, but my 48 hour period expired. Although I usually read all Listserve emails on the day I get them, this one I didn't open on time to respond to it (48h).</p>
<p>This may be a lesson worth to be shared. It's a metaphor of what life is all about: taking the chances, grabbing the opportunities. Because they will arise and if we are not ready to take them it may almost be like they never even existed to us.</p>
<p>But in my life I have learnt that there is always a second chance. If this message is reaching you it is the proof that it is true.</p>
<p>So, if you are reading this...</p>
<p>1) Be ready to take the opportunities in your life.<br />2) If you think you just missed one, try to pursue it anyways, cause it may not be completely lost.<br />3) Learn from your mistakes so you don't miss another one, and be ready for the next.</p>
<p><br />Love,</p>

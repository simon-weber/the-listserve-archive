      \ more legitimate than others.  But the desire to put pen to paper has always\
      \ been there.  And as time and life have progressed, the need to just sit down\
      \ and dump the weight of my world onto a blank page has become overwhelmingly\
      \ cathartic.\r\n\r\n I have long felt the need to start some kind of an online\
      \ journal or blog, not just to share my life but also share in the lives of\
      \ others.  In the end, I think I just needed something to force me out of my\
      \ shell, push me over the edge and put myself out there on the interwebs.\r\n\
      \r\n I can\u2019t think of a better opportunity to do so than The Listserve\
      \ project, and I am grateful for the chance to read about your lives and share\
      \ a bit about mine.\r\n\r\nIt feels like I have lived more than my share of\
      \ life in 33 years.  Far more than I can boil down into a 600 word email.  I\
      \ have traveled the world, married the love of my life, and started a beautiful\
      \ little family.  I helped start and ultimately ran a nonprofit working with\
      \ AIDS Orphans in Southern Africa, worked in politics in Washington, and currently\
      \ have a successful career as a commercial real estate executive.\r\n\r\nI have\
      \ also been broke, anxious, depressed, and have seen a good bit of tragedy.\
      \  I abruptly lost a number of close loved ones, most recently including my\
      \ wife\u2019s 28 year old brother and my infant son.  I also almost lost my\
      \ wife, who continues to have health problems that now prevent us from having\
      \ additional children and may eventually reduce her longevity.\r\n\r\nThe details\
      \ of these stories will have to wait for another day.  But the thing that I\
      \ really want to share is the impact that they have had on my life.\r\n\r\n\

      \  Certainly, a number of these events in my life are far greater in significance\
      \ than an minor inconvenience, but I think that despite their scale, Chesterton\u2019\
      s words have remained true throughout the highs and lows of my personal journey.\r\
      \n\r\nFor me, enduring the valleys in life and enjoying the peaks, are possible\
      \ through only the pursuit of proper perspective.  The key has been to focus\
      \ on the balance between the two and to realize that in most things, the journey\

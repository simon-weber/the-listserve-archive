      We\u2019ve been at it for a few years now and I\u2019m afraid I feel the same\
      \ way about you as I did about God. Let\u2019s face it. I\u2019m not measuring\
      \ up. I\u2019ve been trying to \u201Ceat, pray, love\u201D for a while now,\
      \ and I\u2019m 30 pounds overweight, quite confused, and alone. I\u2019m supposed\
      \ to spend my life giving it away for others, doing something that I love to\
      \ do, and earning a sizeable income while at it. But that story\u2019s not working\
      \ for me any more. Who exactly is it working for, again? You evaluate me based\
      \ on where I grew up, where I went to school, where I\u2019ve worked, where\
      \ I\u2019m working, where I\u2019m living, where I\u2019m moving (or why I\u2019\
      m not moving), what I \u201Cwant to do with my life,\u201D what I look like\
      \ on Instagram, what I sound like on Twitter, what I\u2019m listening to on\
      \ Spotify, who I\u2019m dating (if I\u2019m dating\u2014am I datable?), what\
      \ I\u2019m eating, drinking, reading, driving, saying, not saying and, goddammit,\
      \ it\u2019s just too much. And you want it all to look effortless! Heaven forbid\
      \ I look like I\u2019m trying. You want me on the edge and playing it safe\u2014\
      living like money\u2019s no object and saving like it\u2019s the only object.\
      \ You want me sensitive and untouchable, hilarious and dead serious, hopeful\
      \ and cynical, put together and chicly untethered, well-adjusted and restless.\
      \ And I just can\u2019t cut it. It\u2019s kind of ironic. You\u2019ve started\
      \ to look a lot more like \u201CGod\u201D than you used to. The primary difference\
      \ is that you\u2019ve got a whole lot more unwritten rules to play by and, let\u2019\
      s be honest, a whole lot less promise. As a result, you are now dead to me,\
      \ World. And to make this eminently clear to you, I reject your supreme commandment:\
      \ that I must be myself. I reject this precisely because that is how you keep\
      \ me climbing your ladder. I\u2019m done climbing.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nJustin\r\
      \n\r\n\r\nDecember 23rd, 2014\r\n\r\nDear God & World,\r\nI miss you both dearly,\
      \ but I\u2019m not budging. You\u2019re both dead to me. Hope? No. There\u2019\
      s no hope. Not unless one of you can drag yourself out of the grave I put you\
      \ in and figure out a way to climb down here and love me even when I can\u2019\
      t be myself to your liking.\r\n\r\nHopefully,\r\n\r\nJustin\r\nthedesertdoves@gmail.com\L\

      \ call me a grumpy guy, down in the dumps, whatever. I brush it off and frown\
      \ on into the sunset. But that's fine. Because even beneath it all, I think\
      \ there's one thing keeping us all spinning on this ball of water, people and\
      \ green - music.\r\n\r\nI'm a student of history (and most things) and I think\
      \ music keeps us all guessing, angling at what's next. That's probably the reason\
      \ why we haven't blown ourselves up yet. We love a good story. What happens\
      \ next? What's at the end of the rainbow? We'll keep running toward it, pushing\
      \ away obstacles and jumping over challenges until we find out. No one wants\
      \ to be the guy who writes \"The End\" when we're having such an interesting\
      \ time.\r\n\r\nBut music is the way we decorate time and space - art decorates\
      \ just space, TV and movies and books decorate just time. It's an invisible\
      \ force that vitalises us - much like air - and brings us closer together. In\
      \ the 17th and 18th centuries, the Europeans invented waltz music to break down\
      \ the barriers between dancers. Instead of dancing side by side, they could\
      \ now dance in front of each other. Music may have precipitated the novel idea\
      \ that love and marriage is for other reasons than money and prestige. Of course,\
      \ this is just my theory. Well, Shakespeare might back me up.\r\n\r\nThough\
      \ we're not a ritualistic society. Well, not really. Even so, our rites of passage\
      \ are marked with music. Christenings, graduations, weddings, you name it -\
      \ there's songs to commemorate them, across every culture. Music is everywhere.\
      \ After the shocking tragedy in Orlando the other day, people came together\
      \ to grieve...and sing. It's a release like no other. We cannot change the past\
      \ but we can make it that little bit better with music.\r\n\r\nPeople gather\
      \ together to see art and watch films, but they aren't sharing the experience\
      \ like music. We sit on seats divided by armrests or clump together and walk\
      \ on to the next painting. I have yet to talk to someone who made a lifelong\
      \ friend watching a film or proceeding past a bunch of paintings. I can recall\
      \ sitting on a bench at high school, earbuds lodged way too far in when a fellow\
      \ traveller walked past and asked what I was listening to. I told him it was\
      \ Slipknot (don't judge - I was 13 at the time...I still love heavy metal though)\
      \ and I offered him an earbud. (Imagine doing that now!) \r\n\r\nHe plucked\
      \ it in, nodded away for a while and we got talking. We talked about other bands\
      \ that were hot at the time (Blink 182! The Offspring!) and we've been friends\
      \ ever since. Music is the neverending story. I think it keeps us grounded,\
      \ and hanging on to this sometimes awful, sometimes beautiful place we call\
      \ home.\r\n\r\nSo what do you think? I'd love to gain a few music loving friends\

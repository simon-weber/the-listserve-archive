  body: "Hello everyone !\r\n\r\nMy name is Steven Page, and I live in Montreal, most\
    \ precisely in the Verdun area. You may be interested in Free Shit Verdun, which\
    \ is something that me, my friend (Hi, Ludauvick) and my girlfriend (Hi, Catherine)\
    \ started just about a year ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe concept is simple : We give free\
    \ shit in Verdun.\r\n\r\nWe have a free library 24/7 in front of our apartment\
    \ where people can take books and also give some. From time to time, we give some\
    \ free stuff with a huge \u201CFREE\u201D panel. It makes people happy, and our\
    \ neighbours love it.\r\n\r\nTomorrow (Thurday the 6th), we will be doing a \u201C\
    Cin\xE9 Free\u201D event, which is basically a movie that we screen in front of\
    \ our apartment, near the street. People bring beer and popcorn, we vote for a\
    \ movie and we chill all night. If you are in the Montreal area, you can come\
    \ over if you want !\r\n\r\nJust type Free Shit Verdun in Facebook and you\u2019\
    ll get all you need to know.\r\n\r\nAND NOW, SOME FREE INSPIRATIONAL SHIT :\r\n\
    \r\nHere are some of my favorite quotes \u201CAn extraterrestrial being, newly\
    \ arrived on Earth - scrutinizing what we mainly present to our children in television,\
    \ radio, movies, newspapers, magazines, the comics, and many books - might easily\
    \ conclude that we are intent on teaching them murder, rape, cruelty, superstition,\
    \ credulity, and consumerism. We keep at it, and through constant repetition many\
    \ of them finally get it.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CIn science it often happens that\
    \ scientists say, \"You know that's a really good argument; my position is mistaken,\"\
    \ and then they would actually change their minds and you never hear that old\
    \ view from them again. They really do it. It doesn't happen as often as it should,\
    \ because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful. But it happens\
    \ every day. I cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics\
    \ or religion.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CYou're an interesting species. An interesting\
    \ mix. You're capable of such beautiful dreams, and such horrible nightmares.\
    \ You feel so lost, so cut off, so alone, only you're not. See, in all our searching,\
    \ the only thing we've found that makes the emptiness bearable, is each other.\u201D\
    \r\n\r\n\u201CFrederick Douglas taught that literacy is the path from slavery\
    \ to freedom. There are many kinds of slavery and many kinds of freedom, but reading\
    \ is still the path.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n ALSO, BE AWARE OF THIS : Legal counterfeiting\
    \ of a national currency for private gains.\r\n\r\n\r\nAND FINALLY : I\u2019d\
    \ just like to take some time to salute someone very important to me. Cath, c\u2019\
    \xE9tait ta f\xEAte le 31 et je crois que c\u2019est encore temps de te faire\
    \ une petite surprise. En fait, tous les jours de l\u2019ann\xE9e peuvent \xEA\
    tre bons pour \xE7a :) Alors voil\xE0, je ne t\u2019avais pas dit que j\u2019\
    avais gagn\xE9 le listserve. Cette fois, c\u2019est pas un troll, j\u2019ai gagn\xE9\
    \ pour de vrai. Tu as le visage d\u2019un ange du moment o\xF9 tu te l\xE8ves\
    \ le matin jusqu\u2019au moment o\xF9 tu te couches le soir, et tout \xE7a sans\
    \ avoir \xE0 mettre de d\xE9guisement sur ton visage. Je t\u2019aime comme \xE7\
    a. Tu es une des seules personnes avec qui je peux d\xE9compresser. Merci d\u2019\

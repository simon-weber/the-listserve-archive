      <p>I find myself pretty jaded and cynical about the listserv emails. The advice
      and life''s lessons that get bandied about are often naive, under-informed,
      or one-sided. You can''t really start your life until you''ve backpacked across

      <p>TV likes to talk about midlife crises a lot. Or at least it did in the 80s
      and 90s, when we didn''t have amazing prestige television. I''m almost 37, which
      is ancient to many of you, young to a few. For me, it''s definitely not a midlife
      crisis, it''s more of a midlife malaise. I''m solidly living the American middle
      class dream, such as it is. But I still really don''t know what to do with my
      life. I''m clearly in no place to give you life advice. The things I know I
      should do, but probably won''t: Exercise more. Drink less. Be more patient with
      my kids. Stop procrastinating.</p>

      \ I had never cheated before that, nor did I ever cheat after that. I don\u2019\

      \ There is something unbelievably empowering about controlling the entire photo-making\
      \ process from beginning to end, and working in a darkroom is, for lack of a\
      \ better word, magical. As someone who never considered himself artistic, I\
      \ cannot quite convey how great it felt to actually feel proud when showing\
      \ others my work. I find myself missing photography a lot, and would love suggestions\
      \ for how to pick it up again in NYC.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t underestimate the impact\
      \ just a few words can have on someone. Within the span of a few weeks, one\
      \ friend told me how something I said three years ago is still positively impacting\
      \ her life, and another friend told me how something I said still hurts a month\
      \ later. The scary part is I barely remember saying either thing. One of my\
      \ favorite TED talks is about this idea: \u201CEveryday Leadership\u201D by\
      \ Drew Dudley. It\u2019s 6 minutes long, and it\u2019s one of the few things\
      \ I think about every single day.\r\n\r\nAwkward moments are only awkward if\
      \ you let them be. Sometimes it\u2019s fun to let them be.\r\n\r\nI decided\
      \ a while ago that nothing would ever be more important to me than (1) the people\
      \ in my life and (2) remaining curious and adventurous. Inspired by this, I\
      \ take time every day to get lunch with someone different from work. Not only\
      \ have I learned so much from my colleagues during these lunches, but I also\
      \ feel significantly more connected to the people I\u2019m around and work with\
      \ every day.\r\n\r\nData is fascinating. I work as a Business Analyst at a tech\
      \ startup in NYC. Like many other companies, we are trying to improve the way\
      \ that people get from A to B. The beauty in insights about human behavior and\
      \ movement hidden within data is what drives me right now. I also recently joined\
      \ Citi Bike (bike share system in NY), and I\u2019ve spent more time than I\u2019\
      d like to admit downloading the publicly available system data and getting lost\
      \ in it.\r\n\r\nMy mom is one of the most inspirational people I know, and she\
      \ just released a book that I encourage everyone to read, especially those who\
      \ have struggled with addiction. It\u2019s technically a cookbook, but she shares\
      \ her 20+ year struggle with an eating disorder and her journey to recovery.\
      \ In the grand scheme of things, I think the recipes are a bonus. The book is\
      \ called \u201CDancing in the Kitchen\u201D, and my mom\u2019s name is Colleen\
      \ Duffy-Someck. Check it out if you get the chance.\r\n\r\nFinally, I\u2019\
      m always looking to connect with people and share stories and ideas. If you\
      \ live in NYC or ever find yourself here, I\u2019d love to meet you and chat\
      \ over a coffee or beer! And if you aren\u2019t in New York, I\u2019d still\
      \ love to hear from you.\r\n\r\nShout out to the people in my life who are forces\
      \ of good in the world: CH, SL, DT, TG, LP, and especially BD for introducing\

<p>When I first joined The Listserve (thanks to Yoav Shapira (hi Yoav!)), I really wanted to win the lottery because, well, I wanted to whine.</p>
<p>Although my goth period was about 20 years ago, I was going through a rough time and I wanted to WHINE about it. I wanted to tell all of you how I was depressed. How following my husband to Seattle and leaving a company (HubSpot) and job I absolutely adored had screwed over my life. How my poor husband felt bad for messing with my career, and how I was soooooooooooooo unhappy.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I didn&#8217;t win the lottery at that point. In fact, this has come at a funny time &#8211; I was indeed lost, but I seem to have found myself. And I found myself just last week.</p>
<p>See, my dream job has always been to be COO of a small to mid-sized company. I have an odd fondness for the blood and guts of a company, and a good personality for #2. This is what I thought I lost.</p>
<p>I thought I lost my path to my dream job because I&#8217;d left my original career path (running IT at law firms) to go to consulting/marketing. And here I am, at a Big Company in Seattle, getting, well, bored with marketing.</p>
<p>Last week, though, after soul-searching, thinking, and praying, I realized something pretty darn amazing &#8211; I&#8217;m not lost. In fact, I never was.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it: you can&#8217;t go directly from IT to operations. At least, not easily. And my MBA wasn&#8217;t filling all the gaps. What has filled the gaps, however, is this crazy sales and marketing thing. Even&#8212;no, especially&#8212;at the Big Company I work for in Seattle.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that I&#8217;m going to change jobs immediately, but it means that I&#8217;ve found my purpose again. I&#8217;m not off track, I&#8217;m not lonely, and my husband doesn&#8217;t have to feel guilty. I know that I want my next job to transition over to operations and that I want to manage people, but I can wait and find the RIGHT job.</p>
<p>I wish that, when I was depressed, I had realized that I wasn&#8217;t off the path. I wish that I had understood that the path was just a heck of a lot more twisty than I anticipated.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to hear about other twisting paths. Oh, and if you&#8217;d like to read less whiny writing of mine, you can find me by searching for "Jenn Steele leading geeks".</p>

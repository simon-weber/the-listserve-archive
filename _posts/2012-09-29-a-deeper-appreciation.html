<p>Stop optimizing your life.</p>
<p>Become excellent at something. Then, teach it to at least two kids. You can learn the whole world through becoming great at one thing.</p>
<p>There is nowhere you are freer than in your own thoughts. Do not censor yourself in the privacy of your own mind. Allow yourself to think the unthinkable&#8212;neither shy away nor dwell too long.</p>
<p>If something makes no sense, think about it harder until it does.</p>
<p>When you are asked something, think until your second thought arrives, then speak.</p>
<p>The process of learning who you are is unsettling and unpleasant. Do it anyway. Know yourself. Nobody else will want to until you do.</p>
<p>Cultivate patience. Work on rhetoric&#8212;every language is beautiful.</p>
<p>Slow down. Quality is always better than quantity.</p>
<p>Predict negatively. That way, you will either be right (pleasant) or surprised by a better outcome (also pleasant). Either way, make an effort to appreciate the present.</p>
<p>Any interaction that begins by raising your blood pressure and ends with opening your wallet is manipulation. Do not be confused by a trusted source.</p>

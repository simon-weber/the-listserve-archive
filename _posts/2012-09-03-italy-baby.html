<p>Hi Listserve<br />&#160;<br />What&#8217;s up? I love hearing your stories, you know. I hope I&#8217;ll be as entertaining as you have been.<br />&#160;<br />First some words about me:<br />I&#8217;m a 30 years old/young guy &amp; have an amazing girlfriend, who luckily also has become my wife since January of this year!<br />When I say married, I mean a civil marriage, not a religious marriage. To be honest, I don&#8217;t really understand why some people have a need to believe in something imaginative. In history, religion only has given us wars, disputes,try to control &amp; influence their followers, .... Don&#8217;t start about all the values it gives us. ;-) Those are just human values that some religions have considered their&#8217;s, but in fact they are not. These values are culturally dependent human values. Nothing to do with religion if you&#8217;d ask me. You know... the world would be such a better place when people stopped believing in those religions and started believing in themselves, their friends &amp; their neighbours. What a fun world it would be!<br />She is also pregnant. My wife I mean, not the religion ;-) It&#8217;ll be our first child, so it&#8217;s kind of spooky, fun, scary &amp; really cool; All at the same time :-)I&#8217;m really looking forward to it.<br />I&#8217;m currently working as a marketeer for Coca-Cola &amp; am &#160;living in the centre of the world (?!?): Belgium.<br />For those who don&#8217;t know Belgium, it is: Brussels / HQ of NATO &amp; EU / Belgian fries (no they should not be called french fries!) / Belgian beers / Kim Clijsters / ...<br />By now, you probably know where Belgium is situated. ;-)<br />&#160;<br />Belgium is a tiny country, but it is awesome. I love living here. I do admit that sometimes people complain too much, but I guess that is the same everywhere ;-)<br />Even though it is a fun country, I&#8217;m hoping to move, in a couple of years, to Sydney, Australia or Atlanta, USA. I already have lived in France &amp; the UK and I love integrating in new cultures &amp; getting to know them. Does anybody live in Atlanta &amp; Sydney? Don&#8217;t hesitate to give your views about these cities!<br />&#160;<br />I&#8217;m sure you won&#8217;t believe me, but in 2 days I&#8217;m leaving on a holiday which is aweseome. Yeaeaeaeaeaeaeaaah!!!<br />I&#8217;m going on a 3-week roadtrip with as an endgoal Tuscany/Umbria in Italy.I love travelling so much. Usually I only decide during the travelling where I&#8217;m going, where I&#8217;ll sleep, etc.<br />Is somebody living there? Or has some good tips to visit there? Or where to sleep? Or what to do? I&#8217;d love to get some out of the box ideas :-)<br />&#160;<br />But now, let&#8217;s get serious. What is it actually that I&#8217;d like to tell to you guys/girls:<br />&#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Only do those things you love doing! Life is way too short to lose time doing this you&#8217;re not passionate about!<br />&#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Be passionate and by being so, make the people around you passionate!<br />&#183;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Eat Nutella during breakfast (I do it every day). It&#8217;s just too good &amp; too tasty to miss out. ;-)<br />&#160;<br />If somebody is visiting Belgium, don&#8217;t hesitate to let me know &amp; I&#8217;ll give you some tips or we&#8217;ll have a (Belgian) beer together!<br />&#160;<br />Enjoy life!<br />&#160;<br />Seppe<br />seppe82@hotmail.com<br />Leuven (close to Brussels (which is in Belgium (which is a country in Europe)))</p>

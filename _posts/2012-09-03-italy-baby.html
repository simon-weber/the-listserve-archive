    body: "Hi Listserve\r\n\_\r\nWhat\u2019s up? I love hearing your stories, you\
      \ know. I hope I\u2019ll be as entertaining as you have been.\r\n\_\r\nFirst\
      \ some words about me:\r\nI\u2019m a 30 years old/young guy & have an amazing\
      \ girlfriend, who luckily also has become my wife since January of this year!\r\
      \nWhen I say married, I mean a civil marriage, not a religious marriage. To\
      \ be honest, I don\u2019t really understand why some people have a need to believe\
      \ in something imaginative. In history, religion only has given us wars, disputes,try\
      \ to control & influence their followers, .... Don\u2019t start about all the\
      \ values it gives us. ;-) Those are just human values that some religions have\
      \ considered their\u2019s, but in fact they are not. These values are culturally\
      \ dependent human values. Nothing to do with religion if you\u2019d ask me.\
      \ You know... the world would be such a better place when people stopped believing\
      \ in those religions and started believing in themselves, their friends & their\
      \ neighbours. What a fun world it would be!\r\nShe is also pregnant. My wife\
      \ I mean, not the religion ;-) It\u2019ll be our first child, so it\u2019s kind\
      \ of spooky, fun, scary & really cool; All at the same time :-)I\u2019m really\
      \ looking forward to it.\r\nI\u2019m currently working as a marketeer for Coca-Cola\
      \ & am \_living in the centre of the world (?!?): Belgium.\r\nFor those who\
      \ don\u2019t know Belgium, it is: Brussels / HQ of NATO & EU / Belgian fries\
      \ (no they should not be called french fries!) / Belgian beers / Kim Clijsters\
      \ / ...\r\nBy now, you probably know where Belgium is situated. ;-)\r\n\_\r\n\
      Belgium is a tiny country, but it is awesome. I love living here. I do admit\
      \ that sometimes people complain too much, but I guess that is the same everywhere\
      \ ;-)\r\nEven though it is a fun country, I\u2019m hoping to move, in a couple\
      \ of years, to Sydney, Australia or Atlanta, USA. I already have lived in France\
      \ & the UK and I love integrating in new cultures & getting to know them. Does\
      \ anybody live in Atlanta & Sydney? Don\u2019t hesitate to give your views about\
      \ these cities!\r\n\_\r\nI\u2019m sure you won\u2019t believe me, but in 2 days\
      \ I\u2019m leaving on a holiday which is aweseome. Yeaeaeaeaeaeaeaaah!!!\r\n\
      I\u2019m going on a 3-week roadtrip with as an endgoal Tuscany/Umbria in Italy.I\
      \ love travelling so much. Usually I only decide during the travelling where\

      \ has some good tips to visit there? Or where to sleep? Or what to do? I\u2019\
      d love to get some out of the box ideas :-)\r\n\_\r\nBut now, let\u2019s get\

    \ and striving to be ethical and kind in a world that doesn't often encourage\
    \ these things. But all my friends said \"NO LIFE ADVICE!\"\r\n\r\nSo instead,\
    \ here are a series of short bedtime stories told to me by my daughter, Olivia\
    \ (5). Note, Henry is her brother, 22 months old, recently adopted; these stories\
    \ were told before he came home to us, when he was just a picture and a name,\
    \ an unknown quantity to her:\r\n\r\nMarch 23 2013: OK dad. So Henry went to the\
    \ park! All by himself. He went to the park and he climb up in the tree. And then\
    \ he fell down! OH NO! and he got a bloody. On his arm! So you have to put a band\
    \ aid on it. Next time I will go with him to the park and say NO HENRY, YOU DO\
    \ NOT CLIMB A TREE, YOU ARE TOO LITTLE. And if he goes in the tree and fall down\
    \ I will catch him, but then he has a time out, because climbing trees is DAMEROUS.\
    \ And then Henry grew up. And he is going to be a bug doctor. What do you call\
    \ that? (an entomologist). Yes, He will be an entomologus. I will catch the bugs,\
    \ and he will look at them. We will go to college! The end. Daddy, you can send\
    \ in mommy now, I am ready to go to bed.\r\n\r\nApril 1 2013: Henry went on a\
    \ picnu - picun - picnic - daddy is that right? (yes.) Henry went on a picnic.\
    \ he went on the table. Mommy said \"Henry! Get off the table!\" So he did. Then\
    \ he went on the horsey [referring to the carousel at Funderland]. He rode on\
    \ the gray horse. But then he saw a big, giant, really big bug! (what did he do?)\
    \ He shoot it! (what is shooting?) You know. Shooting, is like hitting. (what\
    \ did he shoot it with?) Daddy you know, you can only shoot with a shovel. (ok.)\
    \ So he got the bug! But he missed the bug and he hit the gray horsey, and it\
    \ broke! So, BIG TROUBLE. Then he went on an airplane, because he had to go up\
    \ in the sky. On an airplane! Daddy! Then his mommy said COME BACK HERE! (who\
    \ is his mommy?) her name is Jineui. (is that your mommy?) Daddy, it's the same\
    \ person! Then we go home, and it's bedtime. OK, give me a kiss, and go send in\
    \ mommy.\r\n\r\nApril 2 2013: Daddy, here\u2019s the story. Listen. Henry went\
    \ on a submarine - wait. Atchuly, Henry and Jude and Olivia went on the mountain.\
    \ They packed their packback - I mean backpack - and their lunchboxes. They brought\
    \ apples. To eat. And they brought their ladybugs, and their spiders. (why did\
    \ they bring ladybugs and spiders?) I don\u2019t know. And they brought books.\
    \ And they went up the mountain. It was very heavy! So daddy, you ride the elephant,\
    \ and take the backpacks and lunchboxes up the mountain and we will walk. And\
    \ then you can go on the elevator to the top. (does the elephant go in the elevator\
    \ too?) No, it\u2019s too big. Maybe the elephant can go in the elevator later\
    \ when it gets smaller. And we went up the mountain. Daddy, I will tell you the\
    \ rest of the story in the morning, OK? Now send in mommy. We will have blueberries\
    \ for breakfast. Goodnight!\r\n\r\nApril 24 2013: One day, Henry went on an airplane.\
    \ (puts hand up) (what\u2019s wrong?) I\u2019m pausing the story. (long pause)\
    \ The airplane was really big and it had a giant bunny on it, and also a very\
    \ big toilet. The plane was bumping, and Henry went to the bathroom - and he bumped\
    \ his head on the toilet! (oh no!) It\u2019s OK - I put ice on it, and he was\
    \ better. (good!) Then I flushed him! (oh no! Was he OK?) It\u2019s OK. I just\
    \ flushed the pee. Then Henry went outside and got his purse. Goodnight, daddy.\r\
    \n\r\nMay 16 2013: One day there was a tiny little mouse. And Henry chased the\
    \ mouse, and he caught it! It was a gentle one. Everybody was happy! But you have\
    \ to be careful with a mouse, because it could hurt you. (how would a mouse hurt\
    \ you?) A mouse could bite you, and you would be bloody and it would hurt very\
    \ much! (how big is this mouse?) It is a very small mouse, you can\u2019t see\
    \ it. (that\u2019s really small!) Watch out daddy because the mouse is not clean\

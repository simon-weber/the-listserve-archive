    <p>            I am considerably older than most of those who have already posted
    their messages on this site, and thus I have lost most of my armor of idealism
    .  Much of this is due to the experiences I have had working as a Psychologist
    in Massachusetts mill cities for almost forty years.  I feel I have seen almost
    everything humanity can offer.  I no longer question whether something is good
    or bad; I just see it as fascinating.</p>

    <p>            There is nothing anyone can do that would surprise me any more.  Anything
    my wildest imagination can produce someone out there is doing it, and they are
    doing it thinking it will bring them happiness or satisfaction.  Most of the time
    it doesn&#8217;t.</p>

    <p>            I would give you all advice, because I know, better than Dr. Phil,
    what you should do with your life, but more than that I know that you wouldn&#8217;t
    listen. That''s not how people change.  Change has to come through emotional experience.  Perhaps
    in three years you might think back and say, &#8220;maybe that guy was on to something.&#8221;</p>

    <p>            I am a big believer in the saying &#8220;When the student is ready,
    the teacher appears.&#8221;</p>

    <p>            Humans are a work in progress, an intriguing but flawed species.  If
    you haven&#8217;t realized by now, please take notice: the world is almost always

    <p>            Most people are basically kind and caring. They want to get along,
    have a few satisfying relationships &#8211; which is difficult enough-- contribute
    something to the good of the world and then relax and enjoy their family and friends.  But

      <p>as a native German being married to an Iranian wife (that only came to Europe
      in her late twenties) and having travelled to Iran,<br />I can say that I have
      a quite different picture from the country than most people have when reading
      the media. So I come up<br />with a very random list of prejudices and what
      I found to be real.</p>

      <p>1.) Iran is very strictly Islamic<br />I cannot speak for the poorer rural
      areas. But having a look at several Persian cities, I know that there are probably
      less strict muslims in private than there are strict Christians in the USA.

      <p>3.) Women are weak in Iran<br />Women are getting stronger and they fight

      <p>4.) Iran only has oil.<br />While the build quality is not like in the west

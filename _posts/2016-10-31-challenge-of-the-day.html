      \ where they are. Why might they believe the things they do? What circumstances,\
      \ environments, influences, could have brought them to where they are? How do\
      \ those things differ from your own circumstances?\r\n\r\nWhat could you learn\

      \ painful to see people with my past views and people with my present views\
      \ clash in such impersonal, attacking, and stubborn ways \u2013 because I can\

      \ the person I am today, with the views that I have now, if I were only ever\
      \ attacked for what I believed. And the people I now disagree with will never\

      \ stupid or wrong for not agreeing with me. Yet I feel like that\u2019s most\
      \ of the discourse I see today \u2013 shaming people we disagree with, name-calling,\
      \ writing them off.\r\n\r\nI had no control over the setting I was born into.\
      \ I did have control over the way I sought new perspectives when I got older,\

      \ is a product of their environment and their genes. What I mean by that, is\
      \ that if you were in someone else\u2019s shoes, you would be the exact same\
      \ person. Yes, I\u2019m including everyone in that: from the person you disagree\
      \ with, to the homeless woman on the corner, to the total asshole at the store,\
      \ to Kim Kardashian, OJ Simpson, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. (yes, I realize\
      \ that is a very strange list.)\r\n\r\nI think of it as radical empathy. And\
      \ it can be really hard. But whenever I remember it and take a moment to think\
      \ about it, it changes the way I interact with people and think about the world.\
      \  It brings me closer to people I might normally distance myself from. I also\
      \ learn more. By thinking: \u201Cwhat made the cult leader Jim Jones who he\

      \ how, as fellow humans, we may be more alike than different.\r\n\r\nI truly\

      \ humans in this way, we would be more productive in our conversations, in our\
      \ solutions to problems, and in our love for each other.\r\n\r\nSo there\u2019\
      s my challenge for you. In writing this email, I realized I\u2019d let my own\
      \ empathy kind of fall by the wayside \u2013 so it will be my challenge today\
      \ as well.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve written to you all before, about two\

      <p>My challenge for you today:</p>

      <p>Think of someone, or a group of people, who you disagree with, or get really
      frustrated by.</p>

      <p>Got it?</p>

      <p>Now take a moment to think about how they got to where they are. Why might
      they believe the things they do? What circumstances, environments, influences,
      could have brought them to where they are? How do those things differ from your
      own circumstances?</p>

      <p>What could you learn from their perspective?</p>

      <p>Most importantly: if you were in their shoes, would you believe or act any
      differently than they do?</p>

      <p>-----</p>

      <p>As someone who grew up in one (political, religious, worldview, etc) mindset,
      and has done nearly a 180 in terms of switching viewpoints, it can feel really
      painful to see people with my past views and people with my present views clash
      in such impersonal, attacking, and stubborn ways &#8211; because I can see myself
      and people I love on both sides.</p>

      <p>I never would have become the person I am today, with the views that I have
      now, if I were only ever attacked for what I believed. And the people I now
      disagree with will never even be interested in seeing the world the way I do
      now if I just call them stupid or wrong for not agreeing with me. Yet I feel
      like that&#8217;s most of the discourse I see today &#8211; shaming people we
      disagree with, name-calling, writing them off.</p>

      <p>I had no control over the setting I was born into. I did have control over
      the way I sought new perspectives when I got older, and the way I had conversations
      about topics I was curious about, and topics I became passionate about.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve come to believe that everyone is a product of their environment
      and their genes. What I mean by that, is that if you were in someone else&#8217;s
      shoes, you would be the exact same person. Yes, I&#8217;m including everyone

      to the total asshole at the store, to Kim Kardashian, OJ Simpson, Donald Trump

      I remember it and take a moment to think about it, it changes the way I interact
      with people and think about the world.  It brings me closer to people I might
      normally distance myself from. I also learn more. By thinking: &#8220;what made
      the cult leader Jim Jones who he was?&#8221; rather than just thinking of him
      as crazy, I start to think about how, as fellow humans, we may be more alike
      than different.</p>

      <p>So there&#8217;s my challenge for you. In writing this email, I realized
      I&#8217;d let my own empathy kind of fall by the wayside &#8211; so it will
      be my challenge today as well.</p>

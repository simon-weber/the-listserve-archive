    Look in the mirror every morning and ask \"what truth am I hiding from?\"\r\n\r\
    \nHere are some ways I've been dishonest with myself:\r\n=> Living like I was\
    \ close to great entrepreneurial success with really I had no plan.\r\n=> Spending\
    \ more than I was earning: You don't *need* anything except food and used clothing.\r\
    \n=> Enduring a non-constructive relationship - telling yourself \"marriage is\
    \ for life\" doesn't make it any happier. Inevitably you'll end up compensating\
    \ in other ways.\r\n=> Focusing on *appearing* successful rather than *being*\
    \ successful. Who's \"meaningful\" was I trying to achieve?\r\n=> Believing \"\

    \ to be honest in the mirror. Honest with people around me and inviting honesty.\r\
    \n\r\n2013 is kicking off without the outward symbols of success I held onto so\

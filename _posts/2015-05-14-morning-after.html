      <p>Almost exactly one year ago, a show I wrote and directed, called Morning
      After, opened at my college. The play is about sexual assault on college campuses,
      and it was inspired by my own rape in the fall of 2012. In honor of the show&#8217;s
      anniversary, I went back and reread everything I could find from the production
      process. One of the things I uncovered was my director&#8217;s note, and I want
      to share part of it with you all here:</p>

      <p>&#8220;Morning After is my reaction to a national dialogue that too often
      focuses on the act of violence itself rather than the aftermath. It is a response
      to the numerous plays I read that depicted sexual assault survivors as broken
      and defeated rather than working to feel better.  It is my challenge to a culture
      that continues to blame victims instead of the perpetrators, and that shames
      survivors into silence. Most of all, it is my attempt to do what I previously
      thought was impossible: turning a traumatic experience into a personal triumph.</p>

      <p>An important person in my life once told me that love is when a person or
      thing becomes a part of us, when one can no longer be fully understood without
      the other. In the years since, I have never forgotten his words, and I can finally
      say with certainty that he was right. I do not love or forgive the man who assaulted
      me, but I love this show, the way I found to heal. I love the countless people
      who helped shape my vision into the performance you see today. I love the women
      who trust me enough to get onstage and bring my words to life. I know that a
      piece of me is in every aspect of Morning After, just as I&#8217;m sure that
      this show is now a part of me.&#8221;</p>

      <p>It&#8217;s hard to know which experiences will change us, for the better
      or for the worse. I was always someone who needed to know what would happen
      next. Forget just having a 5 year plan- I had a 5 day plan and a 5 week plan

<p>I've been thinking this through for the past day or so. I have a lot of questions I'd love to ask, or answers I'd love to hear. Or, maybe I could tell a story. Something inspiring.</p>
<p>I think what I want to know...is something that I don't already know. So, Listserve, tell me something I don't know. Tell me something unexpected. </p>
<p>What is something unexpected, that you know, that I don't know? Maybe it's a fact, maybe it's a story, maybe it's your biggest fear.</p>

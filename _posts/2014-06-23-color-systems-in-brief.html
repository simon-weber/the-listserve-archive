    body: "Ever wonder why that blue on your monitor prints darker on your printer?\r\
      \nHere\u2019s the basic why \u2026.\r\n\r\nThe two typical color systems are\
      \ RGB and CMYK (you\u2019ve heard these used a lot).\r\n\r\nRGB (red, green,\
      \ and blue) is the type of color system used for light; it is an ADDITIVE system,\
      \ so when you add them all together, you get WHITE.\r\n\r\nCMYK (cyan, magenta,\
      \ yellow, and black) is the type of color system used for basic printing; it\
      \ is a SUBTRACTIVE color system, so the absence of color gives you WHITE (or\
      \ paper, in this case). The use of high percentages of CMYK is called \u201C\
      rich black\u201D (its a deeper black than just using 100% K. And yes, black\
      \ is \u201CK\u201D -- not to be confused with blue, which is \u201CB\u201D).\r\
      \n\r\nThe reason your print doesn\u2019t look like your screen is because you\
      \ can\u2019t produce all the same colors from CMYK that you can from RGB. In\
      \ the spectrum of color you can see, RGB gives you the most options, then the\
      \ Pantone system (we\u2019ll discuss this in a minute), and then the most limiting,\
      \ CMYK. You\u2019ll notice blues and greens print the worst \u2026 you\u2019\
      re hitting the limits of CMYK.  (Google \u201Ccolor gamut\u201D and you can\
      \ see what I\u2019m talking about.)\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned, there is also the\
      \ Pantone Matching System (or PMS for short.) All designers will have what will\
      \ look to you like a paint sample book on their desk; it\u2019s actually a Pantone\
      \ swatch book. Pantone colors are proprietary and widely used to choose a \u201C\
      spot color.\u201D They are pre-mixed colors that will consistently be *that*\
      \ color, 187C is always a dark red.\r\n\r\nA designer will often use this book\
      \ to pick colors for logos because the color translated on screen or from a\
      \ CMYK printer won\u2019t match the actual PMS sample. Also, think about your\
      \ printer and my printer. The type of ink, or paper -- it will change how the\
      \ color looks. Your monitor might not be color corrected like mine, and a website\
      \ will look different from a monitor to a TV set (both use RBG color). Pantone,\
      \ being a premixed color, will ensure consistency throughout all printed materials.\
      \ \u201CBarbie Pink\u201D and \u201CCoke Red\u201D are pre-mixed Pantone colors\
      \ (but their formula is a secret!). There are some generic named colors like\
      \ \u201CRubine Red\u201D or \u201CReflex Blue,\u201D but that\u2019s a holdover\
      \ from some olden-day printing.\r\n\r\nI hope my little lesson on color helped\
      \ you in some small way today!\r\n\r\nNow, a question. Some friends and I are\
      \ trying to get an online magazine-ish-blog started. We ran one for the past\
      \ few years, but now is the time to really do it for REAL, promote it and maybe\
      \ even bring in some extra income with advertising. Our content includes personal\
      \ essays related to current events. It\u2019s about the story behind the story.\
      \ We aren't looking for hard hitting journalists. We're looking for anyone who\
      \ wants to share how their world is impacted by the world around them. If you\
      \ would like to contribute shoot me an email (it\u2019s a few months away from\
      \ launching, but we can provide story topics, or take submissions). Also, if\
      \ you have any experience or can provide guidance for our little startup, I\
      \ would love to talk!\r\n\r\nFinally, to a few fellow listserve readers: Lyndsy,\
      \ I wish you and Rodrigo the best -- and I am so excited for you to start the\
      \ next chapter in your life. Husband, I love you and I don\u2019t know what\
      \ I would do without you. Thank you for sharing this life with me.\r\n\r\n\r\

      K. And yes, black is &#8220;K&#8221; -- not to be confused with blue, which

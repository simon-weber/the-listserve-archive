<p>My New Year's resolution for 2013 is to read 52 books in 2013 - one book<br />every<br />week. I have only picked the first book so far: "Winter's Tale" by Mark<br />Helprin. It is my favourite book, but I have only read it in German. Now<br />I want<br />to read it in English for the first time.</p>
<p>For the remaining 51 books I would like for people on this list to send<br />me<br />their favourite books along with a short description. I'll start:</p>
<p>    Winter's Tale is set in a fantastic version of New York City around<br />    the<br />    20th century. There is a great wall of clouds, in which time and<br />    space seem<br />    to work differently. There is a white horse, which jumps so far that<br />    it<br />    starts to fly. A beautiful but terminally ill girl which has<br />    uncovered the<br />    secret formulas of the universe. And a thief who is on the run from<br />    his<br />    gang, which he betrayed. All their fates are interwined in this<br />    magical<br />    story spanning a whole century.</p>
<p>Please feel free to send me suggestions from any genre - I want to<br />broaden my<br />reading horizon. Thanks!</p>

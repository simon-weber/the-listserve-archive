      \ event that we never miss. She loves all the rides and games. I am a soft touch\
      \ when it comes to my daughter, and she knows it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne attraction\
      \ offered at this event was a bungee/trampoline combo that looked as if it would\
      \ be great fun. Picture a bungee harness attached to cables, and an electric\
      \ hoist supported by a framework of steel that rose about twenty feet in the\
      \ air. Below this was a small air-filled trampoline about six feet in diameter\
      \ and two feet high. My Princess had to experience this! I purchased a ticket\
      \ and off went my little angel. The nice lady strapped her in and my daughter\
      \ began bouncing on the trampoline, the bungee cables keeping her centered and\
      \ allowing her to go high up in the air. So far, so good. The nice lady who\
      \ had strapped my daughter in gave me a big smile \u2014 correction, a big toothless\
      \ smile!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThen it hit me. I had entrusted the life of all I hold\
      \ precious to someone who could not even take care of her own teeth! What was\
      \ I thinking? As my daughter continued to bounce gleefully up and down, I took\
      \ mental notes of the apparatus, trying to determine the weak spots. Where would\
      \ it break? In what direction will my daughter be sailing through the air? I\
      \ made my best guess and moved into an area where I felt it would only be a\
      \ matter of time before I would be rescuing my daughter like Superman. Why has\
      \ fatherhood turned me into such a neurotic? A few more bounces and then they\
      \ raised her up to the top of the unit. Annabella was now suspended about twenty\
      \ feet in the air. If something broke, she would shoot straight up in the air\
      \ like a human bottle rocket!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nice lady pushed a button,\
      \ and my daughter slowly descended, the harness was removed and off we went,\
      \ my daughter fearless and elated, and dad needing a Xanax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
      Then we played a game of tossing ping-pong balls into bowls floating in a pool.\
      \ I\u2019d like to meet the cruel genius who invented this game. Twenty dollars\
      \ later, we won a fish in a plastic bag. When I arrived home, my wife asked\
      \ me if I would go buy a fish bowl with a cover (so the cats couldn\u2019t get\
      \ at the fish). I headed to the pet store, where I was informed that they did\
      \ not have covers for their fish bowls. So they showed me an aquarium \u2014\
      \ a very small, cheap-looking aquarium that made the plastic bag seem like Buckingham\
      \ Palace. So I looked at the better aquariums. One hour later, I left with a\
      \ 29-gallon aquarium, a stand, a filter, a light, gravel, and so on.\r\n\r\n\
      \r\n\r\nAfter three more trips to the pet store, I\u2019d spent about $400 on\
      \ the aquarium and all of the necessary components to make our fish a happy\
      \ fish. My daughter named the fish \u201CPrincess.\u201D I called it \u201C\
      Princess Lucky.\u201D After three days, we determined that the water was now\
      \ suitable for Princess Lucky to enter the aquarium. Amid much fanfare, Princess\

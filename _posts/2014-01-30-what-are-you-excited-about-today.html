      That question wasn't rhetorical. I'd really love to hear your answers.\r\n \r\
      \nAsking myself that question often leads to a little energy boost, a moment\
      \ of gratitude, or a conversation. I'd like to learn from the thoughts it sparks\
      \ for you. \r\n\r\nIf you decide to share with me (and I hope you do), maybe\
      \ I'll combine all the answers and do something with them. Maybe I won't. But\
      \ I have no doubt that I'll be inspired.\r\n \r\nThanks for opening this email!\
      \ And thanks for all the stories you've written and read in this community.\
      \ Thanks for believing we can learn from anyone.\r\n\r\nHave a great day! \r\

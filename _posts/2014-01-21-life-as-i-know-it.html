    body: "Hi there.  Every day I read the listserve and I ponder what it is I would\
      \ say.  And here I am, still wondering.  I\u2019m 42, I have 3 sons 21, 19,\
      \ and 17.  I live with my love and my two cats in a home we just bought in Oregon\
      \ City.  We just moved in November and then December 20 I got the flu and haven\u2019\
      t fully bounced back yet, so I feel like our new life, the one starting with\
      \ buying a home, has not quite started yet.\r\n\r\nA little about me.  In my\
      \ life I\u2019ve been a photographer, a grief coach, an empowerment coach, I\u2019\
      m a published author (my first fiction will be out in 2014 and I\u2019m so excited!).\
      \  I\u2019ve published guided journals, a photography book, and a book of poetry\
      \ so far.  I can honestly say though, that this novel has been my life\u2019\
      s work and that writing a novel is like walking up a very tall mountain.  It\u2019\
      s hard, it\u2019s challenging, and you ponder giving up more than once.\r\n\r\
      \nI currently am the Social Media director for an SEO company but am working\
      \ on moving into freelance social media.  I just don\u2019t feel like it\u2019\
      s best for me to work for \u201Cthe man\u201D you know?\r\n\r\nSo, what words\
      \ of wisdom could I possibly have?  I have a few core beliefs.  I believe that\
      \ at any point, any of us could pass the point of no return.  Like Susan Smith\
      \ when she sent her car into that lake with her children on it.  Who\u2019s\
      \ to say that couldn\u2019t have been one of us snapping?  I try to think compassionately\
      \ towards people who pass that point of no return.  Look what they have to live\
      \ with for the rest of their lives.  I can\u2019t fathom their pain, and I don\u2019\
      t feel a right to judge or add to it.  My personal perspective, and perhaps\
      \ yours differs.  Another of my beliefs is that this world is big enough for\
      \ all of our views on things.\r\n\r\nI can be sarcastic, and a bit snarky, but\
      \ I don\u2019t ever set out to hurt others.  In fact, I don\u2019t understand\
      \ when others shoot their venom on others.  I know a few people who do this\
      \ and I always retreat, I just have no understanding of the desire to hurt others.\r\
      \n\r\nGoals for the year are on my mind.  I no longer do resolutions, but I\
      \ do pick a word of the year to state my intent and this year that word is Community.\
      \  I\u2019ve been a bit reclusive in the past but it\u2019s time for me to participate.\
      \  Time for me to join in my new community of Oregon City, and time for me to\
      \ enjoy the global community I\u2019m a part of.  Any suggestions or input on\
      \ that would be welcome.\r\n\r\nAlso, I\u2019m interested in survival/homesteading.\
      \  I will be growing a garden for the first time ever this year and welcome\
      \ all tips there too.  I welcome suggestions on ways to keep the food too. \
      \ Canning, dehydrating, freezing, etc.  I want to do it all.  Self sufficiency\
      \ seems to be the way to go.\r\n\r\nIf you have ideas on freelancing or suggestions,\
      \ please contact me with those as well.  If you want to know more about me or\
      \ have questions about anything I\u2019ve said, I\u2019m happy to have the conversation.\

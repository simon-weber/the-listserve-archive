    body: "In the last year I have lost, the company I started, my best friend, my\
      \ business partner, a lot of friends who sided with him in what I call, \"the\
      \ great divorce,\" and a lot of respect for an industry I so loved.\r\n\r\n\
      Let me back up... I started a small winery with my two best friends. It was\
      \ amazing...at first. Then, it became apparent that one had to go. (See also:\
      \ stealing, lying, over all assery).\r\n\r\nA couple years later, at a point\
      \ when we were at our most successful, our investors decided... along with my\
      \ best friend and co-founder, to vote me out. (See also: Greed)\r\n\r\nSo then\
      \ why am I so lucky, well dear friends, and I do truly mean dear friends, because\
      \ I read each and every one of these emails with care and great admiration.I\
      \ am so lucky because I hit the surprise, unplanned, genetic lottery, without\
      \ which I might not have survived the last year. (See also: Charlotte June,\
      \ we call her Charlie)\r\n\r\nLast August, I received a text, from a friend\
      \ that I worked with at a restaurant who I hadn't heard from in over a year.\
      \ The exact words escape me but the gist was, I think you should take a paternity\
      \ test. (See also: One, and I do mean one, lonely night a few years ago we went\
      \ out, had some drinks and 20 some odd months later this text.)\r\n\r\nThe next\
      \ few weeks were a blur of worry and shame and searching. But I took the test.\
      \ The results; father hood. I wrote an email to my family (except my parents,\
      \ I flew home to tell them) explaining the circumstances. I would like to share\
      \ an excerpt from that email: 'I want to thank everyone and anyone reading this,\
      \ whether I sent it to you, or someone close that we share forwarded it as requested\
      \ for your love and support during my life. You all are the reason why I feel\
      \ comfortable enough as a human to bestow all that I am and have learned on\
      \ another little person. I know my life is now drastically different and each\
      \ day will come with a new challenge whether small, like now answering my phone\
      \ \"Hi, Aunt Laura,\" instead of cousin Laura, or coordinating the sleep schedule\
      \ of a toddler in advance of a cross-country trek to Northern Indiana in the\
      \ dead of summer. I invite you all to join in on the conversation, and feel\
      \ free to ask me absolutely anything without reservation, as this will in some\
      \ way, small or large, affect you all now as well.'\r\n\r\nThe next day, I picked\
      \ her up, started an Instagram to chronicle the journey (all of you are invited\
      \ to join in: @cjsilliman) and began to learn everything Charlie had to teach\
      \ me.\r\n\r\nSo why share this intimate and possibly embarrassing story with\
      \ 25,000 strangers? (Except for you Lex Friedman, I've heard your voice for\
      \ years) Because I want you all to know that you are only given what you can\
      \ handle, and I really can't stress that enough. You are strong enough to conquer\
      \ what you are faced with, what you have been dealing with, what ails you and\
      \ keeps you up at night. Just the fact that you are here, reading this, means\
      \ you care, means you strive for something more, and new and different. And\
      \ life doesn't give a shit about your plans, and it shouldn't. Because you can't\
      \ plain perfection, and I honestly believe that's what you are and life is.\r\
      \n\r\nThanks for taking the time and welcome to the family. Go follow her journey,\
      \ and mine.\r\n\r\nThank you (See also: I love you)\r\n\r\n\r\nBo Silliman\r\

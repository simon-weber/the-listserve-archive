      \n\r\nFirst \u2013 everyone has some sad story. I have. And my closest friend,\

      \ no people completely happy, everyone is afflicted with different problems\
      \ in his life. Therefore, we should never judge other people easily, since we\
      \ never know their story. Often people smiling the strongest are those with\
      \ toughest past \u2013 but they belive in the power of optimism, they believe\
      \ one should never give up and always have hope. They are right.\r\n\r\nSecond\
      \ \u2013 happiness is a state of mind. One can have all the stuff in the world\
      \ and be unhappy, one can be happy having nothing. It\u2019s all about being\
      \ able to appreciate beauty of this world and what life has to offer. Humbly\
      \ accepting what comes along the way and being happy with every day, every little\

      \ For many years I didn\u2019t believe in love. For many years I thought it\u2019\

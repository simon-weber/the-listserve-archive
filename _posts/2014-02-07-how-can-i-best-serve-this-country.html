      <p>Here''s my story. I am a 22 year old graduate of MIT from Scarsdale, NY.
      In 6 weeks I am supposed to leave for the Army Special Forces selection and
      training. It''s been quite the curious road, initially declining service academies
      and attending MIT, then spurning more "traditional" occupations to enlist. I
      have spent months with family and friends trying to help them understand and
      cope with my decision. However, 16 hours before being told it was "my turn"
      to speak to all of you, I was informed that my application was placed on hold
      because my vision (I''m colorblind) wouldn''t pass muster. It got me to quite
      a bit of thinking - I wanted to enlist to serve and help those in need in a
      direct manner. For those of you who find this incongruous, I urge you to look
      up what Green Berets actually do, look up unconventional warfare, and recalibrate
      from your visions of Rambo.</p>

      <p>Aside from the discipline, camaraderie and everything else I sought out from
      service, I (admittedly, and somewhat proudly) naively believe that individuals
      who wish to serve must do so in both direct and indirect ways. Basically, don''t
      just do hands on work like Habitat in more individualistic settings and forget
      about larger scale movements like grassroots campaigns and supporting larger
      causes. The converse holds true as well - don''t stay large-scale without getting
      your hands dirty. My decision to serve as a Green Beret went to helping serve
      those in need currently under the yoke of oppression and without freedoms. I
      wished to dedicate a legal career after my service to the more large-scale.</p>

      <p>Given the hold-up in my enlistment,  I have been forced to now at least consider
      other opportunities while I wait to hear back, be it in the service or outside
      of it. As such, here''s where I would greatly appreciate the advice and the
      help:</p>

      <p>The more information about unique programs and opportunities to get my hands
      dirty, the better. Sure, everyone and their mother has heard of Teach for America
      or the Peace Corps. Those and many other famous programs are fantastic and I
      wholeheartedly endorse them and all of those who take part as people who, like
      me, are just trying to help make a difference and pay it forward.</p>

      <p>But what are some of the "deep cut" type of programs, great things that deserve
      to be more widespread and have more participants. Especially pending my application''s

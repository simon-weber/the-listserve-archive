      \ since May, 2012, and assuming about 23000 members, I calculate that I had\

      \ lucky!\r\n\r\nI consider myself a minor math geek. One of the ways I express\
      \ that is with participating in an old English pastime called Change Ringing.\
      \ If you have spent time in England, or the East Coast of the United States,\
      \ you may have heard church bells ringing. Normally there are 8 bells, sometimes\
      \ more, rarely fewer. They will ring in \u201Crounds\u201D, from highest note\
      \ (smallest bell) to the lowest.  They may then start permuting their order,\
      \ following a simple rule:\r\n\r\n\t1)\tFrom one change to the next, a bell\
      \ may move its ringing position one place forward, or one place back, or stay\
      \ in the same position.\r\n\r\nThat means that, if I am ringing the bell in\
      \ the 4 position in one change, then for the next change I can either ring in\
      \ the 3 position, or stay in the 4 position, or move to the 5 position. Of course,\
      \ I must also coordinate with all the other ringers, or else things just turn\
      \ into a hash!\r\n\r\nThe way this is normally shown on paper is to put a bell\
      \ number (say, 1 through 8) into a position number (the same count as the number\
      \ of bells). We always start in \u201Crounds\u201D, which is\r\n\r\n\t12345678\r\
      \n\r\nBell 1 is in position 1, bell 2 is in position 2, etc. Bell 8 is in position\
      \ 8. If we now just switch each pair of bells, we will ring\r\n\r\n\t21436587\r\
      \n\r\nBell 1 is now in position 2, bell 2 is in position 1, and bell 8 is in\
      \ position 7. And no bell is more than 1 position away from its prior position,\
      \ satisfying the rule. If we again just switch each pair of bells, we return\
      \ to rounds, and that\u2019s not very interesting. But if we do something slightly\
      \ different, and leave the bells in positions 1 and 8 alone (these are bells\
      \ 2 and 7 currently), and switch every other pair, starting at position 2, we\
      \ get something new:\r\n\r\n\t24163867\r\n\r\nBell 2 is still in position 1,\
      \ bell 4 is in position 2, etc. Again, no bell is more than 1 position away\
      \ from its prior position.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to ring a number of changes, starting\
      \ in rounds and ending in rounds, and never repeat a change. As you can imagine,\
      \ this can take some thought the first time you start thinking about it.\r\n\
      \r\nThe group I ring with is not in a church tower, because the closest tower\
      \ with bells is about 1000 miles away! Instead, we use handbells, with a bell\
      \ in each hand. So, since we are each controlling 2 bells, we only need 4 people\
      \ to ring with 8 bells. And with 8 bells, you can ring for a very long time,\
      \ if you choose the right set of changes.\r\n\r\nOne of the best parts about\
      \ change ringing, versus other bell choirs, is that we can ring with any number\
      \ of people. We don\u2019t worry about someone missing rehearsal. We can still\
      \ ring, albeit with fewer bells to ring.\r\n\r\nIf you are in the San Diego\
      \ area and would be interested in exploring change ringing, or if you have experience\
      \ with change ringing, please search for Encinitas Handbell Change Ringers where\
      \ you will find our blog, which includes contact information. Or just reply\
      \ to this email. I would be happy to chat!\r\n\r\nRandy Zack\r\nrlzack@gmail.com\r\

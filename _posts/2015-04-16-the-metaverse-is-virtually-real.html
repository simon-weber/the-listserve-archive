      \ musings, pleas, playlists, tips, tricks, philosophies and travelogues. I love\
      \ the fleeting glimpses into so many interesting lives that the listserve lottery\
      \ elicits.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I am currently recovering from running a startup\
      \ with my wife for seven years. The company lives on, but it needs city planners\
      \ with spreadsheets and procedures, not pioneers with machetes and delusions\
      \ of grandeur. As a result, I find myself, once again, trying to decide what\
      \ I want to do when I grow up.\r\n\r\nMy early background was in film and television\
      \ and I have always been drawn to storytelling arts of one kind or another.\r\
      \n\r\nWhen I first left our startup I was so steeped in the silicon valley Kool-Aid\
      \ that I became deeply allergic to social media in almost every form. I felt\
      \ that mass communication was becoming infinity wide and about a micron deep.\
      \ Avoiding social media isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, but just thinking\
      \ about the amount of \u2018social media strategy\u2019 needed to produce an\
      \ independent film today gave me that Irish-bachelor-party-hangover feeling.\
      \ I needed about a year of BoingBoing and a lot of books before I would even\
      \ consider coming out of my shell.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s been more than a year and\
      \ I still can\u2019t use Facebook, but I\u2019ve added Twitter Tuesday to my\
      \ routine (just lurking for now) and I use email like a kid trying to grab something\
      \ out of a dark basement. (No matter how fast I retreat up the stairs, I still\
      \ feel like something REALLY bad is about to catch me and drag me in.) But my\
      \ creative spirit is starting to stir.\r\n\r\nI followed the kickstarter for\
      \ Oculus Rift and the slow but determined resurgence of the virtual reality\
      \ vision with a basic tech-geek fascination. But when I saw the early experiments\
      \ with virtual reality (VR) filmmaking - that piqued my interest. Something\
      \ big is happening here.\r\n\r\nVR filmmaking is the process of making movies\
      \ by shooting with a whole bunch of video cameras pointing in all directions.\
      \ You then \u2018stitch\u2019 all of the videos together using ad-hoc tools,\
      \ and an impossible amount of patience. The result is a \u2018spherical\u2019\
      \ video that you watch using one of those geeky looking virtual reality headsets\
      \ that you are seeing all over the news nowadays. The video plays all around\
      \ you, but you only see the part that you are looking at - like life! The director\
      \ loses control of attention management in some ways (e.g. no close-ups to show\
      \ you what\u2019s important) but the feeling of watching something interesting\
      \ play out around you and not breaking the illusion when you turn away is profound,\
      \ and immersive, and all the other buzz words that will try to convey how cool\
      \ this really is.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve built 3 different camera rigs to shoot VR\

<p>I haven't updated my music collection in a long time. I just moved to a new city so I've been a bit distracted. I am hoping you can help me...</p>
<p>Send me one (or some) of your favorite musicians/bands, an album that I absolutely must listen to, or a song that you love. It can be anything from indie rock or classical to rap or folk. I want to hear what you are listening to around the country and world. You can also tweet me your music recs @jazzy3thousand. In return, I will email or tweet you something back. </p>
<p>On a final note, check out these two music-related things:</p>
<p>1. Brandnewnoise: voice/music recording boxes that are super-cool and make great gifts.<br />2. Byrd McDaniel (@JohnnyByrdMcD): an up-and-coming popular music scholar; keep an eye out for his work if you're into that sort of thing. </p>
<p>In the words of Rihanna (or was it Thom Yorke?), "Please don't stop the music, music, music"</p>

    <p>Not all who wander are lost.  In the media, my generation (millennial) gets
    a lot of crap for not falling into place these days.   A lot of the criticism
    aimed at this group centers around us not getting and sticking with jobs.  Many
    of my friends, all recently graduated from college, have been bouncing around
    various internships and entry level jobs for the past 2-3 years just trying to
    find something that fits.</p>

    <p>I have wandered in and out of many different jobs, activities, sports, and
    hobbies in my life and I&#8217;ve learned something valuable from each one.  Mostly,
    I&#8217;ve learned that if you don&#8217;t stick with something you won&#8217;t
    get good at it, but hey, that one takes a while to sink in. And sometimes, you
    just know when something isn&#8217;t right for you. Like ballet, that one probably
    isn&#8217;t going to happen for me (I was kicked out of gymnastics when younger
    due to lack of flexibility). Since college, I have grown less and less sure of
    what I want to do in life, in terms of a career. This insecurity isn''t exactly
    comforting but it has opened my mind to a lot of new possibilities I hadn''t considered
    before.</p>

    <p>I think it&#8217;s ok that a lot of us are wandering.  Maybe more of us will
    actually end up in careers we enjoy and doing what we were born to do.  There&#8217;s

    <p>Ocean by John Butler- I was introduced to this piece a while ago and I still

    thanks buddy</p>

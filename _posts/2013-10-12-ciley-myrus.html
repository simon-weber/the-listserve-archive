    <p>I was raised to believe: go to school, get good grades, go to a good college,

    Well a lot of things. Politics aside, what is the number one thing, in my mind,

    The Internet.  (Email me about this if you want to discuss this)</p>

    <p>This is not a sob story as there are way worse things in life. Just a short
    story from someone, maybe just like you or someone you know, and I am not going

    the Earth blows up (ouch)...hopefully some of us will be on Mars at that point
    in time. My point is we. never. give. up.</p>

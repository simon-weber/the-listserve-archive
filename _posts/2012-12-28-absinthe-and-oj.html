      \ The idea behind it is to get whatever I come up with recorded and online without\

      \ feel free to be as brutal as you like. The more people tear my work apart,\

      \ a 7 track EP of what I think is my best stuff so far.  All of the songs can\
      \ be streamed from SoundCloud or YouTube, but if you like what you hear, you\
      \ can get the EP from Google Play (if Google's review process finishes in time?).\
      \ Or if you ask me, I\u2019d probably just give it to you\u2026\r\n\r\nPPS:\
      \ If absintheandoj dot com goes down, it\u2019s probably just out of utter shock\

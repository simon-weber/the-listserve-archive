      <p>I read once that experiences make you happier than possessions. I believe
      this to be true. Whether it be the best house, or car, or even a pair of shoes
      (and I''ll admit I have somewhat of a love for the latter), these things can
      all be lost. Experiences will always stay with us forever. What''s been most
      important to me is that no matter where you are, however different people may
      seem, we are all the same. We love our children, we want to be happy, to spend
      our time with the people we love and doing things we love. We miss the people
      who have departed us, and we celebrate the most important moments in our life.</p>

      <p>And so I explore the many diverse ways that we accomplish the same things.
      And I hope that this gives me some humility that my ways are no better or worse,
      and that I can keep adding to my wealth of experiences.</p>

      <p>All my love to my family and friends, and missing dearly the ones who have
      departed.</p>

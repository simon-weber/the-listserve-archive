      \ my mental health. Consequently, this was my brother\u2019s death.\r\n\t\r\n\
      I have buried  and I have lost. Yet never have I died from death, until now.\
      \ My sibling died on a Tuesday, weeks before his birthday, 16 days before Christmas,\
      \ 20 days before mom's birthday and 3 weeks and 2 days before the New Year\u2019\
      s start.\r\n\t\r\nOne single gunshot shortly before 10 in the morning. The most\
      \ delicate sound I'd ever heard. Monumental in aftermath, but kind in waking\
      \ me up, for it wasn't jarring. She screamed his name, followed by one last\
      \ inaudible wretch. I told  mom to get out of the house. She took care of him\
      \ in life; the least I could do was take care of him in death.\r\nThe most detrimental\
      \ and beginning of my mental health\u2019s decline wasn't seeing his body, it\
      \ wasn't therapeutically wiping his blood on my skin, nor was it watching the\
      \ blood seep quietly and violently from his head. The biggest and most painful\
      \ monster that day was my walking in his room and positively thinking my brother\
      \ was sleeping. Entering his room and seeing his body positioned in a way that\
      \ looked much like you as you read this right now. He was sitting up on his\
      \ bed; head cocked back and held up by the white wall peppered red behind him.\
      \ I assumed he was cleaning his gun and it simply went off while he slept. End\
      \ of story, simple as that, brother wake up.\r\nIt took the paramedics one half\
      \ hour before they professed doing everything they could. I thanked them kindly,\
      \ walked to my mother and with just one look and no words what-so-ever, I told\
      \ her that her son was gone. Watching your mother mourn a child they gave life\
      \ to, is simply the most divine form of punishment life can give you, for my\
      \ mind will never let me forget her screams. Falling to her knees and announcing\
      \ to the birds that her boy had died; what terror that was.\r\n\r\nThey brought\
      \ him down in a dark blue body bag  45 minutes after. With  neighbors watching\
      \ their spectator sport my mother sang \"You Are My Sunshine\". I whispered\
      \ Pink Floyd lyrics into his ear.\r\n\r\nI hear it every day and night before\
      \ I rest my head. That gunshot will soar through my mind until my inner workings\
      \ stop working, this I know.\r\nMy mother was 46, I 24 and my brother Mark was\
      \ 25 when he died. I wish I could say that I've learned something wise that\
      \ rose from the ashes of his death\u2026That, I have a perspective of betterment\
      \ since that day. But I am still searching to wake up every morning and take\
      \ but one breath that is not riddled with pain. The day I can do so will be\
      \ an accomplishment and maybe a day for imparting wisdom.\r\n\r\nUpon my request,\
      \ sometime in late February of the following year Mark\u2019s ashes were peppered\
      \ like snowflakes upon the mosaic design of Strawberry Fields in Central Park,\
      \ NY. A small piece of him lay with the memory of some of rock n\u2019 roll\u2019\
      s greatest. Now and forever, John Lennon, George Harrison and Mark Limbeck have\
      \ a memorial in the heart of the greatest city in the world, a city in which\
      \ he always wanted to go. Finally, death took him there\u2026\r\n\r\n\u2026\

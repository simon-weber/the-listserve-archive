      \n\r\nI believe that the human species' greatest weakness is obedience. Whether\

      \ to do. Google the Milgram experiment to find out more about this tendency\
      \ to obey authority. Find out more about obedience studies and how this tendency\
      \ in human beings leads to all kinds of horrors. Think about your own responses\
      \ to the world and whether you would obey authorities and follow orders that\
      \ you didn't agree with. Think about how you can free yourself from the programming\
      \ that we are surrounded by in the 21st century. Try to learn to think for yourself.\
      \ It's harder than it sounds - we all get trapped in the dominant belief systems\
      \ of our times and it can be very difficult to transcend them.\r\nThese experiments\
      \ took place in the '60s and '70s. I'd like to think that things are changing\
      \ and that in the internet age, it's harder to lie to people and that people\
      \ growing up today are more likely to question authorities and less likely to\
      \ follow orders that conflict with their own morality. I hope so. What do you\
      \ think?\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\
      \nI've lived most of my life in Durban, South Africa, and currently live in\
      \ Berlin. Last year in Durban and around South Africa, there was a violent and\
      \ heart-breaking eruption of xenophobia against Africans from outside the country,\
      \ in which several people lost their lives. The whole city shut down for a day\
      \ or two as a result, with the highway into the city itself being closed off\
      \ and a terrible climate of fear and despair prevailing. Things got better and\
      \ the ghost of genocide and horror slowly dissipated.\r\nWatching the refugee\
      \ crisis in Europe at the moment, I am reminded of a similar feeling. But it's\
      \ been deeply heartwarming to witness the embrace of refugees by communities\
      \ across Europe, even as Hungary continues to install a razor-wire border to\
      \ stop the Syrian refugees from making their way to safety.\r\nIt has long seemed\
      \ to me that there is a planetary war between the forces of love and compassion\
      \ and the forces of profit and destruction. Although human consciousness has\
      \ radically expanded in my lifetime (I'm 44, born in 1971), I often feel that\
      \ the forces of darkness are winning. The embrace of the refugees by hundreds\
      \ of thousands of people in Europe has shone light into that darkness and it\
      \ feels, even if just for now, like love is taking the upper hand. And I pray\
      \ that that love will spread.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\
      \nSo don't be a robot. Think for yourself. Practice love and compassion. Make\
      \ kindness your religion. And let these forces of positivity spread like wildfire.\
      \ We can make this world a better place. We can save it. We can save ourselves.\r\

      \nI'm a writer and artist. If you'd like to see some of my poems and pictures,\
      \ google \"The Corduroy Man Peter Machen\"  Not all of the links work - the\
      \ site is very old now - but there is a link to a wonderful interview with Patti\
      \ Smith that is well worth reading.\r\n\r\nHave a beautiful day or night wherever\

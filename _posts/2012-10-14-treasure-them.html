      <p>Treasure your friends. Nearly 30 weeks ago, I was forced to cut ties with
      some of my best friends. The friends that I really knew, they were gone to me,
      and the friends that I could still go on with, expected me with my other group.
      So it is this I say, treasure them. Treat every day with them as it could be
      the last. I didn''t know that lesson before this, and it still haunts me. I''ve
      spent nearly 30 weeks more or less alone, and I wake up each day forgetting
      that I''m alone, and I go to sleep missing each and every one of them.</p>

<p>When my gmail popped up and said, congratulations, you've won the listserve, I knew exactly what to say, yet I didn't know how to say it. </p>
<p>Treasure your friends. Nearly 30 weeks ago, I was forced to cut ties with some of my best friends. The friends that I really knew, they were gone to me, and the friends that I could still go on with, expected me with my other group. So it is this I say, treasure them. Treat every day with them as it could be the last. I didn't know that lesson before this, and it still haunts me. I've spent nearly 30 weeks more or less alone, and I wake up each day forgetting that I'm alone, and I go to sleep missing each and every one of them.</p>

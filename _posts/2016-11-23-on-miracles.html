      \ had been my grandfathers, and in the family for 60 years.\r\n\r\nAggressively\
      \ paddling along, some 20 ft. (6.5M) from the coast (also a bit drunk), the\
      \ ring slipped off and begin to plunge to the bottom of the jade green sea.\
      \ I dove into the densely-salted water, eyes-stinging, frantically scanning\
      \ for the thin gold band. The weight of the sudden implications of losing this\
      \ ring, coupled with the superstitional significance of this happening one week\
      \ to my wedding day, brought a level of fear to me unfelt in nearly 36 years\
      \ of life.\r\n\r\nI couldn't see it, couldn't find it.\r\n\r\nNearby, a fellow\

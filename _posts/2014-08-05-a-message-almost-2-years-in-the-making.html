      was asked to, which also means that you can think of this as the only email
      written from the perspective of a non-winner of the Listserve lottery.</p>

      <p>Part One &#8211; Just Gonna Say It&#8230;</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m a generally happy, positive person, but I&#8217;m also a proud
      skeptic, a natural contrarian, a sometimes pessimist, and an occasional grump.
      I tell you this because I don&#8217;t want what follows to be read as insulting
      or critical of the Listserve project or any of the contributors &#8211; I look
      forward to the emails every day, even and especially those furthest from my
      ideological, philosophical or religious standpoint. All that being so, I&#8217;m
      just gonna say it: The deluge of positive messages is becoming one bright, shiny,
      happy blur, with no real weight or influence on my life in general or my days
      individually. I have grown numb to the wise and elegant words. I care little
      about the thoughtful, personal epiphanies, and I wonder if others have had the
      same experience. It strikes me as an interesting phenomenon, perhaps demonstrating
      the notion that you can have too much of a good thing. It&#8217;s also worth
      mentioning that I&#8217;m pretty sure I wouldn&#8217;t be writing this if I
      knew I&#8217;d been selected; that is, I imagine I&#8217;d get bright and shiny
      and happy real quick if I knew this were being sent to 20,000+ people.</p>

      <p>[Part Two deleted, explanation below]</p>

      <p>Part Three &#8211; ?</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m reserving part three in case I&#8217;m actually picked, meaning
      anything that follows was written after I was selected:</p>

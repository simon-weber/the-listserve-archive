      \ thread for the people on the Listserve to be able to continue with or start\
      \ some conversations.  I have kept several of the emails that I enjoyed and\
      \ conversed with a few people along the way. Special mentions to: Fred, Manuel\
      \ Loureiro, Leah R, M Willis,  Charles Austin,  Jason Rosenbaum,  Jennifer Cox,\
      \  Adam,  Ariel A,  Yakira Levy,  Lief Bloomquist,  John Huber,  Chris Powell,\

      \ on to my turn. I started writing a book just last week. I was going to start\
      \ last year but decided more research was in order and waited. I was hoping\
      \ that I would have my turn this year because I wanted to ask the People of\
      \ Listserve for help. I am writing a book about science, philosophy, and religion\
      \ and their interplay. I would like to get input and opinions from a varied\
      \ group and the Listserve is the very best group I can think of for that. It\
      \ spans most cultures, religions, education levels and geographical areas in\
      \ the world as best I can tell.  In essence, it is perfect for what I would\
      \ like to request.\r\n\r\nSo here is the request: please reply to the email\
      \ address below with your email address. Later this year and as need dictates\
      \ I will send you a few questions and ask for your opinions on the subject material\
      \ above. If enough people reply and I have a significantly sized group it will\
      \ become a cited source in the book. Basically you can become part of a poll\
      \ group. I promise not send too much and will never ask for anything other than\
      \ your email and opinion. Once the book is completed I will let you know and\
      \ you can see what you are a part of.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrandon\r\nUSA\r\nBldreso@gmail.com\r\

      <p>I would like to see an archive site. Maybe by month and year. A site that
      will provide a link to reread the emails from the winners on a certain date.  It
      would also be nice to have a rating system and comments thread for the people
      on the Listserve to be able to continue with or start some conversations.  I

      Bloomquist,  John Huber,  Chris Powell,  Alyissa and Anthony Albright. I have
      kept your emails and enjoy them for varied reasons. That is why I would like
      to see an archive site.</p>

      <p>Now on to my turn. I started writing a book just last week. I was going to
      start last year but decided more research was in order and waited. I was hoping
      that I would have my turn this year because I wanted to ask the People of Listserve
      for help. I am writing a book about science, philosophy, and religion and their
      interplay. I would like to get input and opinions from a varied group and the
      Listserve is the very best group I can think of for that. It spans most cultures,
      religions, education levels and geographical areas in the world as best I can
      tell.  In essence, it is perfect for what I would like to request.</p>

      <p>So here is the request: please reply to the email address below with your
      email address. Later this year and as need dictates I will send you a few questions
      and ask for your opinions on the subject material above. If enough people reply
      and I have a significantly sized group it will become a cited source in the
      book. Basically you can become part of a poll group. I promise not send too

      the book is completed I will let you know and you can see what you are a part
      of.</p>

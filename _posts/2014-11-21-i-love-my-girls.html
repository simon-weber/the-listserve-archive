      \  Watching as they learn to walk and talk are great but it is the smaller things\

      \ who knew how to count for quiet some time, learned that each marshmallow she\
      \ counted was represented by an actual number.  Before that, any group of 5\
      \ things could have been counted as 3, 8 or even 10.  It was so cool to see\
      \ her count 5 of them over and over, each represented by its own number.  She\
      \ finally understood!  Once when Xyana had done something mean to Isis while\
      \ we were driving somewhere, my wife was scolding her.  Her reply after a short\
      \ time was \u201Ccan you guys be quiet up there, I\u2019m trying to sleep. \
      \ They used to spend the night 3 or 4 times a week but now live 10 hours away.\
      \  It is not easy to have phone conversations with small children but we manage\
      \ (mostly due to my wife who is a better communicator than I).  It is extremely\

      \  I have kept a journal of them since their birth.  It chronicles the things\
      \ they have learned, the funny things they say and do, and things we have done\
      \ and shared together.  It will be a gift to them one day.  I love reading through\
      \ it.  Words paint a much better and clearer picture than a photo does.  It\
      \ is nice to relive those times in my head.\r\n\r\nThings I like (besides Isis\
      \ and Xyana).\r\nLaughing, talk radio, Rice-A-Roni, pizza, Chinese food, potato\u2019\
      s in any form except raw, pie, macaroni and cheese, licorice, and my cholesterol\
      \ and blood pressure medication.  Food is defiantly my drug of choice.\r\n\r\
      \nI am overweight by about 30 pounds.  Loosing weight is very hard for me. \
      \ I go up and down between 230 and 250.  I quit smoking 15 years ago and found\

      <p>The most memorable moment of any pilot&#8217;s career is the first solo.
      For most, it is considered the crowning achievement of years of hard work, learning
      and dedication to our craft. It is a chance to push ourselves past our comfort
      zone for the first time. It is a chance to question whether we have the chops
      to complete something very few have even had the opportunity to attempt. Well,
      a few years back I had that very chance.</p>

      <p>The day was uneventful, at least leading up to it. The sun was shining, a
      light wind out of the east and very little traffic at my local airport. After
      putting in about an hour of practice, my instructor pulled over. My hands sweating,
      he jumped out of the plane with a mere wink and wave. Even though I had prepared
      for this moment, I couldn&#8217;t stop the gnawing sense of nausea, stress and
      nervousness as I taxied away alone for the first time. Stopping short of Runway
      16 at Chicago Executive, I went through my checklists (probably about six times
      to make sure I didn&#8217;t screw anything up). Fumbling, I clicked the mic
      to call up the tower:</p>

      <p>&#8220;Tower, holding short of runway 16. Ready for takeoff&#8221;</p>

      <p>Maybe, I should amend my previous statement. It isn&#8217;t the first solo
      (as a whole) that a pilot will always remember, it is the moment you leave the
      ground. This has nothing to do with joy, but everything to do with fear. It
      is at that point, that critical moment, where every pilot makes a choice. We
      make the choice to continue, to push forward past our fears and to embrace the
      unknown.</p>

      <p>Let&#8217;s back up for a second &#8211; how did I even get here? High school
      was difficult for me, as it is or was for most of you all. I was sick a lot
      with various illnesses, a pretty big nerd (especially with aviation) and unsure

      <p>Aviation helped give me a voice. It gave me a sense of belonging, a passion,

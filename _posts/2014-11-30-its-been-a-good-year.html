      January 2014: I quit my excruciating job and packed my bags to move to San Francisco\
      \ from New York. I miss NYC every single day, it really is a place you should\
      \ live in atleast once in your life, it will change your life forever (maybe\
      \ for good, maybe for bad)\r\n\r\nFebruary 2014: I parked myself at a friend's\
      \ place and decided to go travel (ofcourse) and went to South East Asia (ofcourse)\
      \ for a few months. I am so thankful for amazing friends!\r\n\r\nMay 2014: Came\
      \ back and fun serendipitous things that usually are reserved for more fortunate\
      \ started happening to me!\r\n\r\nJuly 2014: I was convinced I would move to\
      \ India unless I found a job, I found a fantastic job\r\n\r\nAugust 2014: I\
      \ was convinced I would quit my new job and move to India unless I met someone\
      \ special, I met someone VERY special; I might be in love with him :)\r\n\r\n\
      October 2014: Found a fantastic apartment in SAN FRANCISCO! Rental market here\
      \ is worse than NYC incase you were wondering! It\u2019s more of a supply/ demand\
      \ thing, I get it!\r\n\r\nNovember 2014: My very close friend decided to move\
      \ to LA so now I am wondering if I should push my luck and threaten fate that\
      \ I'd move to India unless I won a multi-million $ lottery ha!\r\n\r\nAnyway,\
      \ I started a new chapter in my life this year. Love, life and a great apartment!\
      \ Does a girl need more in San Francisco? Yes, yes she does. I could use a great\
      \ taco. If you are from here or have been here and have suggestions for delicious\
      \ tacos (or food in general), please let me know! I promise to add it to my\
      \ list for the taco crawl and let you know how I liked it. I like crawls. If\
      \ you live in NYC please go to Taqueria LES on Orchard St. Get the carnitas\
      \ taco. It will blow your mind.\r\n\r\nThat's all I have today. No advice from\
      \ me, I wouldn't be very good at it if I tried. Its Thanksgiving time and I'll\
      \ spare y'll the mundane but I will say please be thankful for what you have,\
      \ you are definitely more fortunate than most if you have a laptop where you\
      \ are reading this email. Threaten fate every so often, sometimes it surprises\
      \ you!\r\n\r\nHave a lovely Thanksgiving and a wonderful Christmas!!\r\n\r\n\
      Love,\r\nAvani (Avni is how you pronounce it, means Earth! Isn't that cool?\
      \ My parents are the best!)\r\n\r\nPS: I want to start a microfinance organization\
      \ someday and also a school where kids especially women get education for free.\
      \ If you have ideas, stories, experiences with either please email me! Especially\
      \ if you tried and failed! Not to undermine the successes, but failures end\
      \ up getting better life experiences..\r\n\r\nPPS: I hate Uber. Look up the\
      \ recent slew of insanities by the company and their drivers. As a woman I find\
      \ the company's culture abhorrent. What are your thoughts about the company?\
      \ If you don't have an opinion, I say form one. Let me know. I love hearing\

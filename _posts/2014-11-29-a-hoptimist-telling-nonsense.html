    body: "Hi @ all out there!\r\n\r\nWhen I received the notification that I've won\
      \ \"The Listserve lottery\" I was sitting on the train\u2019s floor on my way\
      \ to work. My non-dog-dog (too tiny for being a dog too smart for being a cat)\
      \ was sitting on my lap licking a specific spot on my trousers. And I was deleting\
      \ thousands of spam mails, almost falling asleep and trying to keep my eyes\
      \ open (I almost deleted the notification).\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve lost my job and\
      \ there are \u2013 three days, 8 hours per days \u2013 24 hours left. I\u2019\
      ve been working there since I\u2019ve left school and started the 10th year\
      \ with the 2nd of November. I got told on 12thAugust -  one day after I returned\
      \ to work after I had to stay at home cause of a knee injury - that I\u2019\
      m fired. My boss asked me for an appointment, and I asked him if I was in troubles.\
      \ \u201CNo, nothing special\u2026 just a 15 min-talk\u201D was his answer. When\
      \ I got told on the other day I started laughing at him and congratulated him\
      \ for having the stones to do so. He looked at me as I\u2019m a moon calf and\
      \ yes I\u2019m.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t talk much about myself, but here \u2013\
      \ dear strangers \u2013 are some facts:\r\n\r\n## I\u2019m weird and crazy and\
      \ not very tall. I\u2019m a student, photographer, graphic designer, illustrator,\u2026\
      \ creative person. I was silly enough working there for 9 years, part-time studying\
      \ and full-time working. I\u2019m sometimes pusillanimous and sheepish but also\
      \ stubborn as a mule and I\u2019ve started to like the person I am just in that\
      \ specific moment, when I started laughing at my soon-2-be-ex-boss.\r\n## I\
      \ got told from my father \u2013 and yeah, your parents should be telling you\
      \ that you are the smartest and most awesome child in the world \u2013 that\
      \ I\u2019m crazy, dumb and so on for 25 years. The last time I\u2019ve talked\
      \ to him (the day before he moved out and the day before my parents got divorced)\
      \ he yelled some really bad things at me and I started laughing and congratulated\
      \ him for not having the stones to accept me as the person I\u2019m.\r\n## I\
      \ really hate my eldest brother, cause he did some really bad stuff to me. I\u2019\
      ve never told all of it to anybody and for years I was persuading myself, that\
      \ it has been my fault. To be honest I don\u2019t really hate him, I just don\u2019\
      t take care of him anymore and started to take care of myself.\r\n## My grandpa\
      \ was more like my father than my father was. He was an awesome person and when\
      \ he passed away in September 2010, some of my family-members thought I didn\u2019\
      t sorrow. But we had some really long talk in May 2010 and it was also the moment,\
      \ when he said good-bye to me. After this day he was not the same anymore, he\
      \ didn\u2019t even recognize his wife and I was everyone \u2013 his daughter,\
      \ his wife, old friends etc. Cause of this awesome person I\u2019m studying\
      \ and trying to do things I really want to do. Thx.\r\n## I have Aim. Not only\
      \ an aim \u2013 I really have many. But I\u2019ve Aim \u2013 aka Amy, non-dog-dog.\
      \ And the reason I got her, was cause I needed something to take care of, as\
      \ it was a tough time for me and I didn\u2019t take care of myself. It was after\
      \ my parent\u2019s divorce, my grandpa\u2019s death and accepting, that it wasn\u2019\
      t my fault, what happened when I was younger.\r\n\r\nSo as you can see, I\u2019\
      m not in the position in giving you some good advices for your life. I\u2019\
      m not the right person in telling you how you\u2019ve to live your life.\r\n\
      \r\nI\u2019m a \u201Choptimist\u201D - a hopeful optimist.\r\nAnd I\u2019m a\
      \ hoptimist all time.\r\n\r\nMy friend is working in Kurdish republic and I\
      \ know what\u2019s going on there.\r\nSomeone I know is working in Mali \u2013\
      \ (the Ebola virus epidemic around Mali has led to thousands of deaths).\r\n\
      A friend of mine \u2013 who always wanted to have children \u2013 has got told,\
      \ that she suffers from cervival cancer some weeks ago.\r\n\u2026\r\n\r\nI\u2019\
      m not the right person in giving you some good advices. I\u2019m just trying\
      \ to give my best and to change the world in some (good/better/acceptable/wonderful/awesome)\
      \ way.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not a genius and I won\u2019t find the global solution\
      \ for every problem out there.\r\nI\u2019m trying to give my best \u2013 trying\
      \ to make good graphic design (and not to accept bad one) to make our world\
      \ a little more beautiful. I\u2019m photographing to record (social) wrongs\
      \ and bloom sides. I\u2019m photographing and illustrating to make things visual.\
      \ I\u2019m trying to raise my voice whenever something bad happens.\r\n\r\n\
      I believe that we all can change the world in some way. And we all together\
      \ can change it to a better place for everybody.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a hoptimist.\r\
      \nAnd I started to believe in myself in August when I started to do what I want.\
      \ I\u2019m working together with my friend (who is the world\u2019s best photographer\
      \ \u2013 just had to mention that) \u2013 and although that was something I\
      \ didn\u2019t thought it would work - we already completed some nice joint projects\
      \ since August. Music Posters, CI for start-ups, \u2026\r\n\r\nAs we all know\
      \ that a Listserve-mail without advices wouldn\u2019t work or be right some\
      \ random advices for you:\r\n\r\nBelieve in yourself - do some cool stuff -\
      \ let\u2019s do something together - drink more coffee \u2013 let\u2019s help\
      \ each other \u2013 read more books (the real books) \u2013 if you own a pet,\
      \ cuddle it \u2013 if you own a dog one extra cuddle for it \u2013 kiss your\
      \ friend more often \u2013 tell persons you love that you do so more often \u2013\
      \ do what you want, it will make you happy \u2013 lets swap some work \u2013\

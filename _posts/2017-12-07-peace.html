      \ I want to share with you.\r\n\r\nI am a publicly-schooled, 33-year-old INFP\
      \ American male from a small-town/suburb.  I have a degree in something practical\
      \ from a local university and a job that is rarely demanding, allowing ample\
      \ time for my undisciplined mind to wander.  My parents were both from poor\
      \ families.  My father (ethos), mechanical whiz but emotionally immature, was\
      \ helping to support his divorced mother financially while still in high school\
      \ by working at McDonald\u2019s.  My mother (pathos) lives in fear that she\
      \ will inherit her mother\u2019s mental illness.  They sought simultaneously\
      \ to escape their families and to save each other.  Their relationship is a\
      \ cycle of eruptions and volcanic winters, and their unhappiness colored my\
      \ early life.  I love my parents and I no longer blame them for unconsciously\
      \ passing their unhappiness to me.  I have an older brother who does not speak\
      \ to me-- I don\u2019t know why-- and an older sister who makes me feel sane.\r\
      \n\r\nI have wrestled with what to share with you \u2013 wrestling with questions\
      \ of quality vs. quantity, the urgency of net neutrality and inequality and\

      \ so many days in bed, not able to persuade myself to get up. Fear of failure\
      \ has kept me from many opportunities to learn and grow.  For a long time, I\

      \ own death.  I remember being called a \u201Ccancer\u201D by a supervisor at\
      \ an organization I cared deeply for, breaking down in the bathroom, and feeling\
      \ an abiding inner reassurance during the whole episode.\r\n\r\nMany of these\
      \ moments of peace have resulted from meditation.  Meditation has given me hope,\
      \ insight, joy, space to hold troubling emotions and a tool for working through\
      \ them, creativity from parts of my unconscious that had become numb, and empowerment\
      \ to choose my responses and my impact on the world around me.\r\n\r\nNow, I\

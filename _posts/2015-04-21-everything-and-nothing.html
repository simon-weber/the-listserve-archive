      \ i realized that i've been collecting listserve emails for over a year without\
      \ reading them so i started to read them again and will keep reading a couple\
      \ of them a day until i read them all and it\u2019s great!\r\nI am sorry in\
      \ advance for the text, i will probably jump from one text to another.\r\n\r\
      \nSomething about me maybe. I am computer security enthusiast, beginner Geocacher\
      \ (check out Geocaching), programmer both private and professionally, nerd and\
      \ a little bit of an all doer.\r\nI used to think that the word nerd were negative\
      \ and usually got angry when someone called me that but i changed my mind and\
      \ now i think is great to be a nerd. It usually means that you are an enthusiast\
      \ of something and i would guess pretty good at it. From my perspective it seems\
      \ like the nerds are more fun than other people as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis weekend\
      \ me and my girlfriend went geocaching in the forest nearby and it was pretty\
      \ exciting because it was the first time we tried it, so there we went on this\
      \ real life treasure hunt.\r\nWe went into the forest a sunny afternoon and\
      \ we brought out our map with the coordinates to this first treasure and pretty\
      \ fast we saw that it wasn\u2019t too far away. When we got closer to the coordinates\
      \ there was a wooden bridge. We went over it and down one of the sides carefully\
      \ to not slip into the water and checked under it. And would you look at that\u2026\
      \r\n\r\nA horrific toad!\r\n\r\nNo actually there was a magnetic PET tube with\
      \ paper and a pencil inside. We logged our visit and got on our way again. Brought\
      \ up our map and checked the coordinates to the next treasure.\r\nWe got deeper\
      \ into the forest and picked up a couple of caches on our way but we were on\
      \ our way to one specific cache, at an old army training field.\r\nWe got to\
      \ the specified coordinates but could not really find anything but dead trees\
      \ and we almost gave up, my girlfriend told me that we should give it one last\
      \ try and so we did! I got back to the first place i looked at and found a little\
      \ door with a broken lock. I opened it and will you look at that! An old bunker,\
      \ i gave my girlfriend the flashlight and crawled inside to get a better look,\
      \ it went down and had a door on the other side as well. I saw that door before\
      \ but it was locked.\r\nI went down and took some easy steps because it was\
      \ some trash down there and BOOM! the door closed hard and it went pitch black\u2026\
      \ a scream! me i realized soon enough. I crawled up and clawed for the door\
      \ and, puh! the door went up and there she was smiling her brightest smile that\
      \ went into a laugh\u2026 I grinned at her and told her that if she wanted this\
      \ treasure she had to get into the bunker as well to light the way. We got down\
      \ there again and after a while we found it! It was a great cache, not many\
      \ other had found it. A great day!\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are in the IT business\
      \ you will probably appreciate a tumblr called Devops Reactions, search for\

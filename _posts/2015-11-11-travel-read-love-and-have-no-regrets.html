      \ I have been able to come out through the most difficult of times (read: a\

      \ travelling. It liberates you, makes you explore, and also makes you feel so\
      \ humble and thank god for giving you the opportunity to experience something\
      \ so beautiful. I travelled to Spiti Valley, Himachal, India, which felt like\
      \ heaven on earth. So, guys, go travel. I think I am the best version of myself\

      \nDon\u2019t ever have any, any, any regrets in life whatsoever. If you have\
      \ to bend or break to save a relationship, do it. It\u2019s okay if it doesn\u2019\
      t work, but if you don\u2019t try enough, trust me, a few years down the line,\
      \ you may just regret not putting in that extra effort. If it doesn\u2019t work\
      \ out, then I am sure, it wasn\u2019t mean to be.\r\n\r\nApart from travelling,\
      \ I love reading. I\u2019m currently reading \u2018Still Alice,\u2019 which\
      \ has managed to choke me up quite often. I usually alternate between a happy\
      \ book and a rather emotional one. Helps balance it all! And, movies! I can\
      \ spend my life in an auditorium, or having movie marathons at home.\r\n\r\n\
      I guess, that sums it up. Here\u2019s wishing you all a great end to the year\

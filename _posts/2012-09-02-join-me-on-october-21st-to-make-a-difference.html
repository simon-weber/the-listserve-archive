<p>So, if you're already familiar with ALS, feel free to skip to the next paragraph. Take a moment and imagine what it would be like to be a prisoner in your body. You are unable to move, communicate, or even breathe on your own. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, affects the nerve cells in the brain and spinal column that control all of your body's voluntary muscle movements. Little by little, as these muscles weaken and die, you lose control of your body. Your cognitive abilities remain intact, and so the disease effectively traps you inside your own body until the end of your life. ALS is currently incurable.</p>
<p>A little over 2 years ago, my uncle lost his battle with ALS. The heartache it has brought to my father, my aunt and my cousins is something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. Since his passing, many members of our family have become active in the fight against ALS, which brings me to my heartfelt plea:</p>
<p>On October 21st I'll be participating in the ALS Association's Walk to Defeat ALS at the Los Angeles Coliseum. I'd like to invite everyone in the LA/Southern California area to walk with me! You can e-mail me for details about joining my team, let's harness the incredible power of this group to make a difference in the world! If you can't walk, please consider making a donation to ALS research. Together we can find a cure.</p>

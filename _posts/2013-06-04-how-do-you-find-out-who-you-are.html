      \ with it.  I live with it.  I am a mother with it.  I laugh with it.  I cry\
      \ with it.  I am mad at it, and yet, I am happy with it.  And if it feels the\
      \ same about me, I hope I make it mad.  I define it, and I defy it.  I get up\
      \ with it.  I go on vacation with it.  I wear it in my sneakers and walk it\
      \ with my cane.  I move with it, I move on with it, and maybe one day we can\
      \ be friends.  But until then\u2026I will prove it wrong.\r\n\r\nI think that\u2019\
      s the definition of what we all should be.  We should actually be the ability\
      \ to prove it wrong.  Whatever it is.  MS, any chronic illness, any non-chronic\
      \ illness, any time and any where someone or something asks who you are\u2026\
      \ define yourself.  Anyone who says you can\u2019t, prove them wrong.  Anything\
      \ that says you shouldn\u2019t, prove it wrong.  So, just be.  Be you, be the\
      \ best you that you can be.  Get up every morning, put your feet on the ground,\
      \ and go.  Go prove them wrong!\r\n\r\nPS \u2013 I made a video for a well known\
      \ company that I hope will inspire people with MS, and any other chronic illnesses\
      \ to hang in there.  If you would like to see it, please email me.\r\n\r\nPPS-\
      \ I am an avid reader, and love all types of books, both fiction and non-fiction\

      <p>For me, it was in 1998.  Six months until I was getting married, and I couldn&#8217;t

      <p>I think that&#8217;s the definition of what we all should be.  We should
      actually be the ability to prove it wrong.  Whatever it is.  MS, any chronic
      illness, any non-chronic illness, any time and any where someone or something

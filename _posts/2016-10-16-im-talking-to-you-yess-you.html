      \ LA, gazing out the window, wondering what all of you are doing right now,\
      \ & where in the world you might be.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s twilight, & the sky\u2019\
      s a deep purple\u2026 I see 9 commercial airlines waiting to land at LAX. Also,\
      \ I can see both the sun and the moon in the sky.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m alive, breathing\
      \ the same air as you, walking on the ground you once stepped on, or one day\
      \ will. \u2026 I can\u2019t help but wonder if you and I have brushed shoulders\
      \ somewhere in the world, we very well might have.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s 6:47pm on\
      \ a Friday, and my dog, whom I utterly adore is curled up on my feet, fast asleep.\
      \ I\u2019m glad he is because his warm, heavy body is preventing me from getting\

      \ that this is more than likely the largest audience I will ever have, and I\
      \ am humbled to have the opportunity to reach you in as personal a space as\
      \ your email.\r\n\r\nYou know, it\u2019s very possible that as a collective,\
      \ we have experienced every variation of human emotion\u2026 cool! Together,\
      \ we\u2019ve walked on every continent; who knows, maybe we\u2019ve collectively\
      \ darn near explored every corner of our earth.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not a blind\
      \ optimistic; I, too, live in the very same world that you do. Yes, I\u2019\
      m abridge to the issues that we as humanity are currently facing. I\u2019m exposed\
      \ to the same news as you, & inundated with messages of bigotry and discrimination,\
      \ just like you. I only wish the media would gratify us with a little positivity\
      \ every now and then. In actuality, we as a \u2018people\u2019 do kind, selfless,\
      \ and amazing things every day, but they go unrecognized.\r\n\r\nTo quote the\
      \ Listserve, \u201CIf given the opportunity, what would you say to a million\

      \ when it\u2019s all said and done, apparently the content of this email is\
      \ what I would say.\r\n\r\nBefore I slink away into obscurity, I want to create\
      \ an opportunity for us to connect. If you feel inspired, do reach out.. I\u2019\
      d love to hear from you! You can email me at \u2018shareyourstorieswithme11\

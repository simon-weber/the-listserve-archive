      \ I understood what I am and realized that being an empath is gift, that sometimes\

      \ I can read people and their emotions like a book. I can sense motivations\
      \ (pro). This has helped me be good at my job. Flip side - it\u2019s impossible\
      \ to separate myself from the negativity of others. I can FEEL everything they\
      \ FEEL (con). Depending on the person, this can leave me in a variety of states:\r\
      \n\r\nExample: At my grandfathers funeral I was fine, UNTIL I saw my grandmother\
      \ crying.\r\nExample: When someone I love feels wronged, I get angry FOR them.\r\
      \nExample: When I\u2019m around people with bad vibes (you know the type), I\
      \ walk on egg shells and CANNOT shake it until they are gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
      Television shows can also affect me in bizarrely intense ways. This severely\
      \ limits my Netflix options (con, lol).\r\n\r\nExample: I only watched 2 seasons\
      \ of Sons of Anarchy. I gave up. The violence was too much.\r\nExample: I suffered\
      \ through Making a Murderer. Watching Brendan Dassey on that couch, I BECAME\
      \ him. I felt interrogated! I panicked when I couldn\u2019t remember my alibi,\

      \ After shows, it takes me three days to recover. Not because I drank (I don\u2019\
      t drink) or because I stayed out late. It's because of the energy of the crowd.\
      \ Everyone is searching for something so desperately... it\u2019s as if they\
      \ are not whole. They want to meet another person, be another person, take home\
      \ another person, etc.\r\n\r\nThe collective missing pieces amongst 1,500 strangers\

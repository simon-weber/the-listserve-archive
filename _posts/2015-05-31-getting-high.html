      \ high pressure ridge which resulted in light and variable surface winds and\
      \ a lazy northwest flow aloft with fat cumulus clouds that filled the sky most\
      \ days.  The flying that week was exceptionally good. It was hot and dry, with\
      \ drought conditions throughout the region, and daily temps that hovered near\
      \ or exceeded 100 degrees (F) on the hottest days.\r\n\r\nThe conditions on\
      \ the concrete launch ramp (2,000msl) that day were brutal, and made worse with\
      \ the extra clothing I wore, as I hoped I would get really high.  Cloud base\
      \ was expected to exceed 8,000\u2019 msl. The lack of any wind at launch meant\
      \ there was no cooling breeze and I had to wait quite a while, fully geared\
      \ up and hooked in, on the launch ramp for an indication that thermal lift was\
      \ within reach.  When Mack- a pilot who had towed up - began climbing in a thermal\
      \ I could easily glide to, I launched.  It was about 4:20 pm and I immediately\
      \ began circling in the abundant lift.  I flew aggressively, banking steeply\
      \ and flying as close to stall as possible to maximize my climb rate.\r\n\r\n\
      My climb rate was 1,200 fpm at times and averaged 800 fpm. What a rush!  I watched\
      \ a large cumulus cloud form above me and  as I approached it\u2019s base I\
      \ stopped circling and raced to it\u2019s edge, since entering it was both foolish\
      \ and illegal.  I arrived at the edge and the base simultaneously and looked\
      \ at my altimeter.  9,100\u2019msl!  Man, I was HIGH!\r\n\r\n As I flew away\
      \ from the cloud I looked behind me and was stunned to see I was now above cloud\
      \ base!  Whoa!  I turned 180 degrees, slowed to minimum sink speed, and,  in\
      \ a state of indescribable bliss, climbed in some of the smoothest lift I\u2019\
      d ever encountered- at a steady 100 fpm- as I made passes along the face of\
      \ the pure white cumulus.  I was now in wave lift, created by a layer of air\
      \ above cloud base flowing up the \u2018ridge\u2019 that the cloud\u2019s mass\
      \ had created. My \u2018glory\u2019 was a vivid rainbow shadow on the white\
      \ face below me.  I eventually climbed high enough to see over the top of the\
      \ cloud (!) and decided I did not need to get any higher.  I topped out at 10,930\u2019\
      msl.\r\n\r\nI was, by then, bitterly cold, as the temperature at that altitude\

      \ but limiting  my climbs  to 7,500\u2019msl to stay warm while I waited for\

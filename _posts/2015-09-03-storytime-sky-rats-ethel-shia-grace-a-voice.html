      <p>My friends and I are storytellers all - so much so that we create origin
      stories for our Christmas trees and identities for our main courses (see Story
      2). It''s our way of remembering what''s good, what''s changed, and what''s
      fun. I''m thankful for the story I get to live.</p>

      <p>Story 1: Sky Rats<br />The day after my grandfather''s memorial service,
      my mom, dad, and I went to my happy place: Santa Cruz, CA. We were sitting on
      a wharf, looking out over the ocean. The sky was incredibly clear, sea lions
      barked below us, and a surf competition was taking place a little ways off.
      We dug into our recently purchased colossal-sized box of taffy, peering out
      over the California-goodness. My dad uttered, "Man, I could sit here all afternoon."
      A deep, collective sigh of contentment. When, BLOOOOOPPPPPPP!!! A flock of seagulls
      sharted on all three of us. My dad and I looked at each other in shock, as my
      mom let out a wild laugh and yelped, "Blessed by the sky rats!" We all cracked
      up as I wiped bird poop off of my dad''s head.</p>

      <p>Story 2: Ethel Merman, Shia LeDuck, &amp; Grace Kelly<br />We named our first
      Christmas tree Ethel Merman. She was tall and gawky, her top branch scraping
      our ceiling, her branches creeping over the armrest of our couch. In the spirit
      of a woman clinging desperately to her gilded glory days, she dressed in far
      too much tinsel. She took photos with all of our guests, sang "Everything''s
      Coming Up Roses" with that jarring voice, and even had a boyfriend, Harry -
      a real boy! We escorted her to our snowy curb after having enough of her wild
      ways, but we weren''t fully rid of her until October of the next year! Ethel,
      smh. At Thanksgiving, the duck we were cooking became "Shia LaDuck," after watching
      Rob Cantor''s genius Shia Labeouf video somewhere between 1 and 20 times. We

      <p>Story 3: A Voice<br />My life has been pretty easy when compared to others.
      But everyone''s got their stuff. I was abused as a kid by friends, dealt with
      anorexia and all the crap that comes with that, and had some serious co-dependency
      issues. In my last year of grad school, I was losing my mind trying to keep

      \ of writing a list of my life rules, in order to achieve all my goals and become\
      \ the person I want to be, and suddenly an email from the Listserve arrives\
      \ to my inbox, like sent from heaven!.\r\n\r\nMy name is Javier Sanchez and\
      \ I\xB4m from Mexico City. I\xB4m 26 and I work as an auditor in a Copper Mining\
      \ Corporation. I love to work out at the gym, read LOTS of books and walk my\
      \ dog.\r\n\r\nBut who really I am on the inside? I am a dreamer, a goal setter,\
      \ a go-getter; so that is what occupies my mind all day, everyday. Stuff like:\
      \ \xBFHow to become the perfect version of myself? \xBFHow to achieve the life\
      \ I wish for? \xBFHow to lead, inspire, and help the people? I\xB4m craving\
      \ to know the whole world, and as a secret between us, my BIGGEST dream is to\
      \ live someday in NY, but I still don't have a plan for achieving that u_u.\r\
      \nSuch kind of things are my life quest.\r\n\r\nI was reading the other day\
      \ \"The Great Gatsby\" (which you should read if you haven't because its awesome!)\
      \ and there is a part at the end of the book (no spoilers) where we learn which\
      \ were the life rules of Gatsby because he knew from a very young age that he\
      \ was meant for greatness.\r\n\r\nSo I decided today that I was going to start\
      \ my own life rules, and so far they go like this:\r\n\r\n1.- THE FIRST RULE\
      \ IS THAT DON'T EVEN ME CAN BREAK A RULE.\r\n2.- FIRST THINGS ALWAYS COMES FIRST.\r\
      \n3.- I sleep and wake up everyday at the same hour. At 9 p.m. and 5 a.m.\r\n\
      4.- I work out everyday at 6 a.m. at the gym, except for weekends which I only\
      \ run.\r\n5.- No fat foods ever. That includes sugar (like sodas) or any fried\
      \ food.\r\n6.- Sundays are for cleaning the house, buy the grocery and preparing\
      \ my clothes for the week.\r\n7.- I\xB4m a person of integrity and I live according\
      \ to my values and principles. Some of they are: I never lie and I never take\
      \ anything that doesn't belongs to me.\r\n8.- I\xB4m punctual to any meeting,\
      \ and I do mean ANY meeting.\r\n9.- I take care of my image a lot. That includes\
      \ my hygiene, clothes, posture, smell, breath and calligraphy.\r\n10.- I'm a\
      \ gentlemen, in my way of talking and treating everyone.\r\n11.- No one is allowed\
      \ to treat me bad. Also I'm nowhere allowed to treat bad anyone.\r\n12.- I\xB4\
      m 100% self confident.\r\n13.- I\xB4m never afraid to talk to anyone, nor to\

      <p>Almost like a coincidence, I am today in the process of writing a list of
      my life rules, in order to achieve all my goals and become the person I want
      to be, and suddenly an email from the Listserve arrives to my inbox, like sent
      from heaven!.</p>

      <p>My name is Javier Sanchez and I&#180;m from Mexico City. I&#180;m 26 and
      I work as an auditor in a Copper Mining Corporation. I love to work out at the
      gym, read LOTS of books and walk my dog.</p>

      <p>But who really I am on the inside? I am a dreamer, a goal setter, a go-getter;
      so that is what occupies my mind all day, everyday. Stuff like: &#191;How to
      become the perfect version of myself? &#191;How to achieve the life I wish for?
      &#191;How to lead, inspire, and help the people? I&#180;m craving to know the
      whole world, and as a secret between us, my BIGGEST dream is to live someday
      in NY, but I still don''t have a plan for achieving that u_u.<br />Such kind
      of things are my life quest.</p>

      <p>I was reading the other day "The Great Gatsby" (which you should read if
      you haven''t because its awesome!) and there is a part at the end of the book
      (no spoilers) where we learn which were the life rules of Gatsby because he
      knew from a very young age that he was meant for greatness.</p>

      <p>So I decided today that I was going to start my own life rules, and so far
      they go like this:</p>

      <p>1.- THE FIRST RULE IS THAT DON''T EVEN ME CAN BREAK A RULE.<br />2.- FIRST
      THINGS ALWAYS COMES FIRST.<br />3.- I sleep and wake up everyday at the same
      hour. At 9 p.m. and 5 a.m.<br />4.- I work out everyday at 6 a.m. at the gym,
      except for weekends which I only run.<br />5.- No fat foods ever. That includes
      sugar (like sodas) or any fried food.<br />6.- Sundays are for cleaning the
      house, buy the grocery and preparing my clothes for the week.<br />7.- I&#180;m
      a person of integrity and I live according to my values and principles. Some
      of they are: I never lie and I never take anything that doesn''t belongs to
      me.<br />8.- I&#180;m punctual to any meeting, and I do mean ANY meeting.<br
      />9.- I take care of my image a lot. That includes my hygiene, clothes, posture,

      <p>That&#180;s how far I&#180;ve got. &#191;What do you think about it? &#191;Do
      you have any life rules?</p>

      <p>I WOULD REALLY LOVE TO SPEAK, WRITE AND KNOW YOU. IT DOESN''T MATTER WHERE

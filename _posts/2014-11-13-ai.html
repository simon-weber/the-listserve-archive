      <p>AI is the process of understanding of how people think on a fundamental level.
      Instead of trying to figure out how each individual neuron in your brain works,
      AI tries to generalized this by think computationally. An easy way of understanding
      this, is as The Wright Brothers, they didn''t look at birds and try to model

      general basic such as aerodynamics and how to get a similar effect using everyday
      materials.</p>

      <p>Most of the time when you think you apply some kind of a computational scheme,
      for example if you are trying to find your car keys, you know that they are
      usually either in your pocket or on the table. So the next logical step would
      be to check your pocket, if you do not find anything then that means that they
      are on a table. This is done automatically by your brain without you realising
      most of the time. If we scale this problem up, to say going grocery shopping,
      then it become a lot more difficult: what products to buy, at which supermarket(better
      quality, closer location, cheaper prices), how to carry them home(on car or
      by foot, limiting the amount of groceries you are able to buy). This becomes
      such a complex task that we have to individually dedicate our time to thinking

<p>I literally received the "you've been selected" email yesterday 30 minutes after telling two of my best friends about the Listserve &amp; how crazy it would be to write for it over lunch at "Don Molina&#180;s" in Bariloche, Argentina.  WOW Timing is everything!</p>
<p>And today I am writing you from my hostel after getting back from white water rafting on the Rio Manso river which is in the mountains  2 hours north of Bariloche.  It was aaaaamazing and this town is breathtaking.  It sits at the foothills of the Andes mountains near the Chilean border.  If you ever get the chance please visit!</p>
<p>I manage a commercial real estate firm near Silicon Valley where all the Tech Giants live, Facebook, Google etc...  I am successful at what I do, not because I have any secret formula but because I work my but off, know my market like the back of my hand &amp; I always try to be in the right place at the right time.  I can&#180;t tell  you how many deals I have done when I called a potential client consistently or met a client at a function I didn't have to be at and on that day happened to be the day they decided they needed a commercial agent for their business.  Timing is everything!</p>
<p>I actually fell in love with the girl who introduced me to The Listserve.  We met volunteering at the Aids Health Project in San Francisco of all places.  We dated on and off for over a year and a half until she moved back east (where she is from) to go to grad school in New York to get her masters in social work.  I think it is inspiring that she has chosen a career where she gives all of her time, knowledge &amp; help to those who truly need it.  Oh and she is also smart, funny &amp; sexy as all get-up.  We both live very busy lives,  she is living her life life studying, working &amp; experiencing New York and all it has to offer on her own, which makes me happy now and I know she is too.  I miss her like crazy sometimes and would love to be in the same city again so we could go on our fun dates and just enjoy each-other.  I have no idea what the future holds for us? But that's OK, such is the mystery of life &amp; like I said... Timing is EVERYTHING</p>
<p>I would love to hear your "timing is everything stories"  or anything at all:)</p>

    body: 'You are a unique, badass, and multi-faceted human being. There is no one
      else even remotely like you. Who are you to withhold your greatness from the
      world?


      Why would you waste a second of your precious time pretending to be someone
      else? How dare you hide your gifts from us? Why would we want you to be like
      every other [insert category here] out there?


      We don''t.


      We want you. The authentic you. The real, genuine, imperfect, weird, quirky,
      REAL you. Anything less than that is  not enough.


      Just be you. It''s the most amazing gift you can give to yourself, to me, to
      everyone in your world, and everyone in the world.


      It''s easier for some people than it is for others. If it''s hard for you, make
      it your life''s work to search for and find your authentic self. There is nothing
      more urgent.


      Take full responsibility for your thoughts, behaviors, actions, the consequences
      of those actions, and the impact you have on people around you.


      Be grateful. Appreciate and love what you have and what''s working.


      Seek clarity. Figure out what you like, what you want, and what''s important
      to you.


      Make decisions based on what''s aligned with your values and what you''re passionate
      about.


      Learn to let go of the things/people/thoughts that don''t serve you or steer
      you toward happiness and fulfillment.


      If you know what''s important to you, it''s easier to know why you are doing
      things and what things you should be doing. Don''t waste time doing things that
      are not related to what''s important to you.


      Dare to be emotionally accessible, vulnerable, and to expand your emotional
      range. Go for depth, richness, and honesty. It''s raw, it''s terrifying, and
      it''s exhilarating.


      Whatever you are, whoever you are, and whatever it is that you''re all about
      - OWN IT.


      Be unapologetically you. Know what you''re about and pursue your dreams with
      an open heart and genuine passion. If someone doesn''t like it, that''s fine.
      But it''s not your problem.


      Seek resonance. This is where the magic happens. Don''t fear it. Embrace it.


      Be alive. Be real. Be you.


      I dare you.

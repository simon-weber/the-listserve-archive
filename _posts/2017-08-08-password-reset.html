      <p>So instead I get to share some random thoughts with you.</p>

      <p>I joined the Listserve in 2015 and about 2 weeks after I joined I received
      an email that one of you sent and it changed my life&#8230;because it basically
      helped me relearn the same lesson that I&#8217;ve been learning and continue

      true for you all but it&#8217;s true for me.</p>

      <p>A few things:</p>

      <p>People are not always nice and that&#8217;s okay.</p>

      <p>People come in and out of your life, if they&#8217;ve left try not to hold
      on too hard, sometimes you have to loosen your grip. I think about my relationships
      as a solar system, I&#8217;ve found it very useful.</p>

      some have helped and others have backfired so much that some things I think
      have retreated farther into the depths of my body than they should have.</p>

      <p>Question I&#8217;ve been wondering, I&#8217;m positive the answer is yes
      but I&#8217;m going to ask anyways: Is there anything that you all don&#8217;t

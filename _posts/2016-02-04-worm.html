      \ I love how a really good story can change the way I look at things. I also\
      \ love talking with people about reading, hearing their opinions, getting recommendations,\
      \ and giving some in turn. My favorite messages from the listserve have been\
      \ reading recommendations. When I get exposed to something outside of what I\u2019\
      m used to it\u2019s like getting to see from another person\u2019s eyes. In\
      \ that vein I\u2019d like to give you all a recommendation for something a bit\
      \ off the beaten path.\r\n\r\nA few months back I stumbled across a web serial\
      \ (like a book but published online a chapter at a time) called Worm. It\u2019\
      s long, about as many words as the complete Song of Ice and Fire series so far.\
      \ I found it during an incredibly busy time what with life, research, and finals.\r\
      \n\r\nI read the whole thing in three weeks.\r\n\r\nI read quite a bit in 2015,\
      \ including many Hugo and Pulitzer prize winners. Worm was without a doubt my\
      \ favorite read of the year.\r\n\r\nPlot Summary from the website: \u201CAn\
      \ introverted teenage girl with an unconventional superpower, Taylor goes out\
      \ in costume to find escape from a deeply unhappy and frustrated civilian life.\
      \ Her first attempt at taking down a supervillain sees her mistaken for one,\
      \ thrusting her into the midst of the local \u2018cape\u2019 scene\u2019s politics,\
      \ unwritten rules, and ambiguous morals. As she risks life and limb, Taylor\
      \ faces the dilemma of having to do the wrong things for the right reasons.\u201D\
      \r\n\r\nWhile Taylor is a teen and the first few chapters focus on issues she\u2019\
      s having at school this is in no way a work about a teenage hero who has to\
      \ balance high school against their superhero life. It is instead an answer\
      \ to the question \u201CWhat would it be like in the real world if superheroes\
      \ started appearing?\u201D. There aren\u2019t any pure paragons of virtue or\
      \ mustachio twirling villains here. Every aspect of the world is carefully considered\
      \ and every action has consequences.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite things about\
      \ the series is how smart the characters and plotting feel. Fights aren\u2019\
      t won on brute force alone and people very rarely play fair (Taylor especially).\
      \ As the story progresses the stakes keep rising higher and higher, but there\
      \ aren\u2019t any cop outs or magical resolutions to problems. The story strikes\
      \ a nice balance between progressing logically and having enough surprises to\
      \ keep you guessing what will happen next.\r\n\r\nA warning: this series is\
      \ addictive and many chapters end on cliffhangers, making it difficult to put\
      \ down. I pulled more than a few late nights while reading it. If you\u2019\
      re in the middle of a busy period it may be best to wait on picking this up.\r\
      \n\r\nIt\u2019s available in its entirety for free. Just google \u2018worm parahumans\u2019\
      \ and the first result should be the wordpress site where it was published.\
      \ There\u2019s also a free unabridged fan made audiobook, just google \u2018\
      worm audiobook\u2019.\r\n\r\nI hope some of you get as much out of this series\
      \ as I have. If you want to talk about it with me feel free to email. There\u2019\
      s also an active community over on Reddit at r/Parahumans. Shoutouts to them\
      \ for giving me advice on how to properly explain the sprawling epic that is\
      \ Worm.\r\n\r\nFinally, if you have any unusual recommendations for books that\
      \ meant a lot to you I\u2019d love to hear them!\r\n\r\n\r\nIan Fox\r\nian4listserve@gmail.com\r\

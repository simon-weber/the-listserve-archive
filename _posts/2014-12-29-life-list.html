      \ -Eleanor Roosevelt\r\n\r\nMany of you are probably familiar with the concept\

      \ way off, I've more optimistically dubbed mine a \"life list.\" I've been keeping\
      \ it since I was 15, with the goal of mesmerizing my future grandchildren with\
      \ crazy tales of my bizarre and eventful life. Every time the road seems too\
      \ narrow or my life feels circumscribed, I push all my energy towards achieving\
      \ one of the items on the list. This year, I checked off \"hug a panda,\" \"\
      learn to saber open a bottle of Champagne,\" and \"eat ramen in Tokyo,\" not\
      \ to mention some unintentional additions, like \"get paid to write 50 trivia\
      \ questions about Gilmore Girls\" and \"get made fun of by Brian Boitano.\"\r\
      \n\r\nMy life list, like life itself, will never be completed, and that's OK.\
      \ If anything, it gets longer every year, and every item checked off seems to\
      \ grow three new ones, hydra-like, in its place. Some of the items are genuine\
      \ life skills, some are idle fantasies, and probably far too many of them involve\
      \ drinking the most delicious drinks possible. But though it may be silly, the\
      \ list reminds me that the world is open, that some dreams can be small and\
      \ attainable, that if you don't ask, you don't get. For a little insight into\
      \ my (admittedly odd) brain, here are 15 items that I'm working on right now.\

      <p>Many of you are probably familiar with the concept of a "bucket list," a
      tally of all the things that you want to do and be and see before you die. In
      the hope that my dance with the bucket is a long way off, I''ve more optimistically
      dubbed mine a "life list." I''ve been keeping it since I was 15, with the goal
      of mesmerizing my future grandchildren with crazy tales of my bizarre and eventful
      life. Every time the road seems too narrow or my life feels circumscribed, I
      push all my energy towards achieving one of the items on the list. This year,
      I checked off "hug a panda," "learn to saber open a bottle of Champagne," and
      "eat ramen in Tokyo," not to mention some unintentional additions, like "get
      paid to write 50 trivia questions about Gilmore Girls" and "get made fun of
      by Brian Boitano."</p>

      <p>My life list, like life itself, will never be completed, and that''s OK.
      If anything, it gets longer every year, and every item checked off seems to
      grow three new ones, hydra-like, in its place. Some of the items are genuine
      life skills, some are idle fantasies, and probably far too many of them involve

      list reminds me that the world is open, that some dreams can be small and attainable,
      that if you don''t ask, you don''t get. For a little insight into my (admittedly
      odd) brain, here are 15 items that I''m working on right now. If you think you
      can help me get closer to achieving any of them, I''d be so grateful.</p>

      <p>- Learn to caramelize onions perfectly, every time<br />- Go to a Japanese
      baseball game, and know all the coordinated cheers<br />- Build a fire without
      matches or a lighter<br />- Get a kiss from Jon Hamm (I know he''s taken&#8212;on

      <p>I''m especially hoping you can help me with that last one. An obstetric fistula
      is an injury sustained in childbirth that renders a woman incontinent. It''s

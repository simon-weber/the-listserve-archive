<p>I love movies. </p>
<p>The last movie that I really liked was Anna Karenina. Ok, I admit I am a huge Joe Wright fan but the cinematography on that movie is just amazing. The dance, the shot at dusk in the farm and the last shot on the movie. I could go on.</p>
<p>The one movie I couldn't bring myself to watch again is Atonement (from Joe Wright also). It was just too depressing to endure again. Heart-achingly beautiful.</p>
<p>Score is as important as a good plot. Pulls the heartstrings, sort of speak. Ennio Morricone is my favorite composer. It was him with Guiseppe Tornatore on Cinema Paradiso whom brought out my first tears from watching a movie. That scene near the end with grown-up Toto on the theaters. I hope you know what I am talking about.</p>
<p>Sometimes I surprise myself identifying movies on cable by their score and a few dialogues without looking at it. #Humblebrag?</p>
<p>I try to make every movie experience as immersive as possible. I prefer seeing it on the big screen, anywhere between the first to fourth row on the front, no noisy/crunchy snacks (even popcorn) and if with company, who rarely speaks. </p>
<p>Of all the big movies coming out in 2013 (Oblivion, Pacific Rim, Iron Man 3, Star Trek and Man of Steel), I am looking forward more to Richard Linklater's Before Midnight with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Remember Before Sunrise and Before Sunset? This is the latest and last of the trilogy. </p>
<p>I especially like foreign movies (non-US), subtitles and all. I am a sucker for movies nominated for Best Foreign Film at Oscars and I have seen a lot since I could remember. I would love to hear recommendations especially from your home countries.</p>

<p>There was this nice and cheesy movie of Matt Damon called We Bought a Zoo that probably etched deeper than any of the movies I had seen in my entire life. It wasn't because of a mind-blowing CGI or a hauntingly beautiful score but from a conversation between a father and his son:</p>
<p>"Sometimes all you need is twenty seconds of insane courage. Just literally twenty seconds of just embarrassing bravery. And I promise you, something great will come of it."</p>
<p>Great advice, isn't it. Every time I need some push, I just start counting down and it would just flow out. :D</p>

<p>It's really hot on my side of the globe lately so to everyone experiencing the tropic heat, stay cool and keep hydrated. </p>
<p>And to the rest of the world, ingat!</p>

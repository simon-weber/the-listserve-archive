    body: "Hello ListServe community!\r\n\r\nSo EXACTLY a year ago from today my close\
      \ friend & home girl Layla (Hii Lovely!) forwarded me a ListServe email titled\
      \ Random Beauty (by Ishita in Kolkata, India, hello to you as well J ). It is\
      \ such beautiful synchronicity that now, literally to the day, I just won the\
      \ chance to write to you all! I\u2019ve thought about this day happening since\
      \ I signed up, but I also believed that something amazing would be in the process\
      \ of occurring when this lucky moment aligns with my life...  And I\u2019m sitting\
      \ here laughing to myself because this is probably the first time in my life\
      \ that I have absolutely nothing concrete/academic or otherwise happening. Well\
      \ played universe, well played... It\u2019s quite unsettling for me, realizing\
      \ this and not knowing when things will change, but at the same time knowing\
      \ they will. Ever get the feeling of knowing something without knowing anything\
      \ at all?\r\n\r\nI know many people avoid changing, and it\u2019s a shame because\
      \ change is beautiful if you let it be. About 3 years ago I moved to New York\
      \ City to pursue a graduate degree in Counseling Psychology at Columbia University,\
      \ but what I have gained in the process of my education is an evolution of my\
      \ entire self.  Young, na\xEFve, hopeful and afraid, I eagerly ventured out\
      \ of my hometown in Houston, TX (what up, Htown!)\u2026 I wanted more, to know\
      \ more, to experience more, and do more. And I still do.  As a counselor, I\
      \ get to help people re-shift, refocus, and empower their life into a more meaningful\
      \ experience, but to me, the most special part of that is the relationships\
      \ I build with people; just connecting with someone. Currently, I\u2019m at\
      \ a very in between place, or rather in transition I should say. I just graduated\
      \ with a double Masters (I know, overachiever much\u2026), and finished an amazing\
      \ yearlong internship as a Family/Couples/Individual Counselor, so what\u2019\
      s next? I can\u2019t wait to find out! Potential employers do feel free to contact\
      \ me (or look me up on Linkedin) J\r\n\r\nSo coming full circle now, in the\
      \ initial ListServe email I was forwarded, I learned about a Japanese phrase,\
      \ Koi No Yokan.  Ishita, you described it as \u201CThe feeling you can get when\
      \ meeting a person for the first time, that you will fall in love with them.\
      \ Different from \"love at first sight\", as it does not say that love already\
      \ exists, only the knowledge that it WILL happen later.\u201D\r\nTo me this\
      \ perfectly describes my relationship with NYC, I didn\u2019t know then that\
      \ I would fall so deeply in love with this city, but I felt it immediately <3\r\
      \n\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\"When we make a change, it's\
      \ so easy to interpret our unsettledness as unhappiness, and our unhappiness\
      \ as the result of having made the wrong decision. Our mental and emotional\
      \ states fluctuate madly when we make big changes in our lives, and some days\
      \ we could tight-rope across Manhattan, and other days we are too weary to clean\
      \ our teeth. This is normal. This is natural. This is change.\"-- Jeanette Winterson\r\
      \n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAlso, just wanted to send\
      \ a special hello out there to my Girls (Fizz, Fatimah, Lay, Elvy, Chirstie;\
      \ love ya ladies), my immediate and extended family (Hey hey\u2026 Muneel/Mustufa\
      \ y\u2019all are probably the only ones that read this...), my soul-mate (somewhere\
      \ out there; you can show up now), and Justin Timberlake (for obvious reasons,\
      \ hehe).\r\n\r\nAnd much love to you all over the world! Be brilliant! <3\r\n\

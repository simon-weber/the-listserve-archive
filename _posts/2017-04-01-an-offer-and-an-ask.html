    body: "Today, for you I have an offer - something that I'd like to share with\
      \ you - and an ask - something that I'd like to request from you:\r\n\r\nMy\
      \ offer: \r\nI'm 22 years old, and am born and raised on the West Coast of Canada.\
      \ I grew up in the heart of the city, but was always let free to play in the\
      \ park, spent summers camping in the interior of BC, and have fond memories\
      \ of forest walks and sandy beach days. I grew up with a deep appreciation for\
      \ the natural environment and my community, but it wasn't until my high school\
      \ years that I really started to learn about the concept of sustainability and\
      \ connect the dots between the things that I care about - our environment, my\
      \ community and future generations. \r\n\r\nOver the past years, I've spent\
      \ time working with policy makers, kids, high school students, bureaucrats,\
      \ campaigners, organizers and many others working to make our world more sustainable.\
      \ It's a field that I'm devoting my life to and that consumes my life: I have\
      \ a strong vision for a planet that is livable, sustainable and equitable.\r\
      \n\r\nIt's a fact that Climate Change is happening, and that we're emitting\
      \ greenhouse gases at an accelerating rate. There are overwhelming numbers and\
      \ projections, all pointing to consequences that are already existent but also\
      \ pointing at future threats - sea levels rising, major droughts and food security,\
      \ massive unpredictable weather events, and the list goes on. \r\n\r\nThis is\
      \ overwhelming to think about. But there are THREE simple things that you can\
      \ do that have an enormous positive impact on reducing your emissions: commit\
      \ to these things at your own pace, and you are playing a huge role in improving\
      \ our planet :)\r\n1. Eat less meat: Food makes up 50% of our emissions, and\
      \ red meat makes up over 50% of our food emissions. Either cut out all beef\
      \ and stick to more sustainable meat sources, like poultry, or have more meatless\
      \ meals. \r\n2. Buy less stuff: We are prone to buying more, sharing less, and\
      \ having the newest best thing. Try to buy something used, fix something instead\
      \ of buying a newer version or just not buying things you don't really need\
      \ in the first place.\r\n3. Participate in democratic processes: Vote! Be engaged\
      \ in local decision-making processes! When a pipeline or other fossil fuel-related\
      \ project is proposed, speak out and let your politicians know that this is\
      \ not consistent with a lower carbon future that we need for our kids.\r\n\r\
      \n\r\nMy ask:\r\nWhen do you feel a sense of purpose? In particular, when do\
      \ you know that you've found your sense of purpose?\r\nThis is coming from a\
      \ 22 year old, about to graduate post-secondary, and in quite a privileged place\
      \ of having a number of doors open post-graduation, passions, self-motivation\
      \ and nothing tying me down. Now as I enter this period of deciding which path\
      \ to pursue at first (and knowing that this will change over time), I'm asking\
      \ myself what gives me my greatest sense of fulfillment and sense of purpose.\
      \ I'd love to hear what gives you your sense of purpose.. or stories of discovering\
      \ yours!\r\n\r\nThank you truly for reading, and sending you good vibes wherever\
      \ you're at - in life and in the world :)\r\n\r\nVeronika\r\nVancouver, Canada\r\
      \n\r\n\r\nPS You never think you're actually going to win the Listserve! But\

      <p>This is overwhelming to think about. But there are THREE simple things that

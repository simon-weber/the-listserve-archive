    body: "How would you know if you were dysfunctional - that you had a toxic self\
      \ image, an inability to have meaningful relationships with others, an obsessive\
      \ need for control, or some other emotional debility?  If you were in denial\
      \ about your dysfunction, how would you know it?\r\n \r\nIf you identify with\
      \ much of the following, called the Laundry List - 14 Traits of an Adult Child\
      \ of an Alcoholic, then you may have learned dysfunctional coping strategies\
      \ as a child that you carried with you into adult life.  These coping mechanisms\
      \ are the laundry list traits below.\r\n \r\nNote that alcoholism is only one\
      \ of many possible \"family diseases\" that can create abuse and neglect.  Other\
      \ addictions, mental illness, sexual abuse, extreme religiosity, etc., can also\
      \ produce adults that identify with the Laundry List.\r\n \r\nThe Laundry List\r\
      \nWe became isolated and afraid of people and authority figures.\r\nWe became\
      \ approval seekers and lost our identity in the process.\r\nWe are frightened\
      \ of angry people and any personal criticism.\r\nWe either become alcoholics,\
      \ marry them or both, or find another compulsive personality such as a workaholic\
      \ to fulfill our sick abandonment needs.\r\nWe live life from the viewpoint\
      \ of victims and we are attracted by that weakness in our love and friendship\
      \ relationships.\r\nWe have an overdeveloped sense of responsibility and it\
      \ is easier for us to be concerned with others rather than ourselves; this enables\
      \ us not to look too closely at our own faults, etc.\r\nWe get guilt feelings\
      \ when we stand up for ourselves instead of giving in to others.\r\nWe became\
      \ addicted to excitement.\r\nWe confuse love and pity and tend to \"love\" people\
      \ we can \"pity\" and \"rescue.\"\r\nWe have \"stuffed\" our feelings from our\
      \ traumatic childhoods and have lost the ability to feel or express our feelings\
      \ because it hurts so much (Denial).\r\nWe judge ourselves harshly and have\
      \ a very low sense of self-esteem.\r\nWe are dependent personalities who are\
      \ terrified of abandonment and will do anything to hold on to a relationship\
      \ in order not to experience painful abandonment feelings, which we received\
      \ from living with sick people who were never there emotionally for us.\r\n\
      Alcoholism is a family disease; and we became para-alcoholics and took on the\
      \ characteristics of that disease even though we did not pick up the drink.\r\
      \nPara-alcoholics are reactors rather than actors.\r\n \r\nRecovery from dysfunction\
      \ is manifested through self-love, emotional sobriety, and serenity. It literally\
      \ means to grow up, to go from an adult child to an adult who is a child at\
      \ heart.\r\n \r\nI have been in recovery for nearly five years. My coping strategies\
      \ were to isolate and daydream, to blend into the background and become invisible,\
      \ and to extract love from my family by disappearing.  Deprived of the attention\
      \ I desperately craved, I unquestioningly accepted abuse and humiliation as\
      \ the price of being included and learned to deny the terrible feelings that\
      \ accompanied them. So naturally my biggest fears have to do with being visible,\
      \ the center of attention, and appearing in any way different from those around\
      \ me. \r\n \r\nIn recovery I have come to love and value myself. I have found\
      \ the courage to be myself, to hang in there and ride out the bad feelings,\
      \ and push back if someone crosses a boundary.  I increasingly know and accept\
      \ what drives me. I can deal with uncertainty.\r\n \r\nIf the pain of staying\
      \ the same is greater than the pain of changing, google \"adult children\" and\
      \ take it from there. Break the cycle!\r\n\r\n\r\nLove to all,\r\n\r\nAnonymous\r\

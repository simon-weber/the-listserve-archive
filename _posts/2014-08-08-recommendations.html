      Place in Hollister, Missouri is the best Chicago-style pizza I''ve ever had.</p>

      <p>Recipes:</p>

      <p>I''ve been on a bit of a health kick lately and this has been a staple. From
      the American Heart Association:</p>

      <p>Fish Tacos</p>

      <p>2 - 4oz tilapia fillets<br />1 tbsp fresh lime juice<br />1/2 tsp chili powder<br
      />1/2 tsp garlic powder<br />1/2 tsp onion powder<br />1/4 tsp salt<br />2 small
      plum tomatoes<br />1 jalapeno pepper<br />1 green onion<br />2 tbsp cilantro<br
      />3 tbsp yellow cornmeal<br />2 tsp olive oil<br />8 corn tortillas</p>

      <p>1. Sprinkle the fish with the lime juice, combine the spices in a bowl and
      rub over the fillets, refrigerate for 30 mins.<br />2. Combine the tomatoes,
      pepper, onion and cilantro in a food processor for 15 seconds. Refrigerate until
      needed.<br />3. Coat the fillets in the cornmeal, shake off the excess. Coat
      a skillet with olive oil, cook the fillets over medium high for 5 minutes a
      side.<br />4. To serve, heat the tortillas, quarter the fillets, add one quarter
      of a fillet to each tortilla and a spoonful of the salsa. Makes 8 tacos. 1 serving
      is 2 tacos (173 calories).</p>

      <p><br /> ...But when I need to carbo-load, this is delicious. Slightly modified
      from the tasting table website:</p>

      <p>Purple Noodles</p>

      <p>1&#189; lbs broccoli<br />1 lb spaghetti<br />1 bottle (750 ml) red wine<br
      />1 tbsp sugar<br />&#8531; cup extra-virgin olive oil<br />2 tsp thinly sliced
      garlic (about 4 cloves)<br />&#188; tsp red-pepper flakes<br />1 tsp salt<br
      />&#189; tsp freshly ground black pepper<br />&#189; cup grated Pecorino Romano
      cheese</p>

      <p>1. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. Add the broccoli and cook for 3
      minutes or until just tender. Transfer the broccoli to a baking sheet and let
      cool. In the same boiling water, cook the spaghetti, stirring occasionally,
      for 5 minutes. (The pasta will finish cooking in the wine.) Reserve 1 cup of
      the pasta water and then drain the pasta and set it aside. Return the empty

      Add the pasta and shake to prevent the pasta from sticking. Gently stir with
      tongs until coated and boil over high heat, stirring occasionally, until most
      of the liquid is absorbed and the pasta is al dente, about 4 to 5 minutes.<br
      />3. While the pasta cooks in the wine, heat a large, deep skillet over high
      heat. Add the olive oil, reduce the heat to medium-low and cook the garlic until
      golden, about 3 minutes. Add the broccoli, red-pepper flakes, salt and pepper
      and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes. Add &#189; cup of the reserved
      pasta water, or more if desired, and stir to combine.<br />4. Add the broccoli
      mixture to the pasta pot, toss gently and transfer to a platter. Sprinkle with
      the cheese and serve.</p>

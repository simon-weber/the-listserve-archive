      \n- I like Sundays.\r\n-I like that football season started today and the Bengals\
      \ beat the Ravens.\r\n- I love Cincinnati. I moved away about six years ago,\
      \ but I know that's where I'll probably settle back down.\r\n- One guy I went\
      \ to high school with was killed about a week and a half ago. I wish I could\
      \ say he's the first.  A different girl I went to high school with's son was\
      \ killed by her boyfriend around the same time. He was two. If you're the praying\
      \ type, Big Ant's and little Josiya's families would appreciate it. If you're\
      \ not that's cool, just try to do something to decrease world suck today with\
      \ them in mind. Actually, even if you do pray, try to do something concrete\
      \ too.\r\n                -Slight tangent: I realized awhile back that many\
      \ of the people I met in college had never known anyone who died violently,\
      \ or even just died young. I once had a conversation with a girl and noted that\
      \ it was entirely possible that 50% or more of our lives might be over. It didn't\
      \ go over well, but it's important to remember.  \r\n- Church was good today.\
      \ We just started a series called \"Live and Let Die.\" Appropriate, I guess,\
      \ given the above.\r\n- I should be writing an exam for my ESL students right\
      \ now. I got my Bachelor's in translation, but had a hard time finding a job\
      \ working with people. I did not want to translate documents, so I went back\
      \ to school for a TESL degree. That's where I am now.  Teaching adults has been\
      \ wild. I'm still not sure if I'm any good at it. They often don't tell me when\
      \ they don't understand things, so it's been a little rough figuring it out.\r\
      \n                - Fun story about how strange it is to teach in a university\
      \ setting: My students did not know the word \"spread.\" I explained it could\
      \ be used for both things and ideas and asked for examples. One girl just looked\
      \ at me and said, \"Oh, like disseminate.\"\r\n-I really want to travel once\
      \ I finish my Master's in a year-ish. I love languages. I'm not always good\
      \ about studying, but I have a list that I'd like to at least become conversational\
      \ in. I'm hoping to teach abroad for 3-5 years. My friends keep pushing me towards\
      \ the Middle East. I think I'd like it, but my mom would have a heart attack.\
      \ One of my professors is pushing Chile. I've got time to decide.\r\n      \
      \          -Quandary: I really want the whole marriage/babies life too. It's\
      \ supposed to be easier if you start before 30, and if I travel I'm gonna be\
      \ pushing that limit. \r\n3) Things I like:\r\n-Languages! If you speak Spanish,\
      \ Arabic, Dutch, or Malay and would like to chat, I would love penpals. Those\
      \ are my focus right now, in order of \"fluency.\" If you speak Turkish, Korean,\
      \ or Tagalog, that's what I'm studying next.\r\n-Soccer! I'm a goalie.  Arsenal,\
      \ Monterrey, and both US teams.\r\n-Books! I will read nearly anything. If you\
      \ have any recommendations (in Spanish or English) I'm interested.\r\n-Being\

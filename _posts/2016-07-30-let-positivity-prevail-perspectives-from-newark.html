      \ Newark. The conference room is jam packed and there\u2019s a buzz throughout\
      \ the place. I take my seat along the side and wait for the ceremony to start.\
      \ In the middle of the room sit 134 eager students, and behind them are hundreds\
      \ of proud family members with their cameras poised, ready to snap a photo of\
      \ their child walking across the stage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s graduation\
      \ day, and although it\u2019s much like every graduation happening across the\
      \ country, it feels even more special because all of the seniors are young people\
      \ of color who grew up in low-income communities. The weight of the occasion\
      \ comes not only because these students made it to high school graduation; it\u2019\
      s also because they finally have a day to celebrate, which is not easy to come\
      \ by in the tough city of Newark. More often than not, they are mourning, angry,\
      \ sad, or frustrated, but today is all about joy. The ceremony proceeds like\
      \ graduations do, but with a few highlights:  the scholarship winners are announced,\
      \ which causes an eruption of cheers from the crowd and a flow of tears from\
      \ the students who are shocked to discover they\u2019ve won thousands of dollars\
      \ towards their college education; the keynote speaker brings her own DJ, and\
      \ part of her speech is to play \u201CAll the Way Up\u201D by Fat Joe and Remy\
      \ Ma, during which the students pop out of their seats and dance; and a fellow\
      \ 2016 classmate, who passed away from cancer, is honored, and her family is\
      \ given a diploma in her name. All of this culminates with the students walking\
      \ across the stage to receive their high school diploma, while their families\
      \ run up to take the photo they\u2019ve been waiting for, big smiles across\
      \ everyone\u2019s faces.\r\n\r\nOnce caps have been thrown in the air and degrees\
      \ have officially been conferred, I make my way across the crowd to congratulate\
      \ the seniors. While doing so, I can\u2019t help but pause and revel in what\u2019\
      s going on. Everywhere I turn, the students from the Class of 2016 are embracing.\
      \ And my favorite part about it is it\u2019s mostly the boys. I see Malik, the\
      \ scholar athlete, and Saheed, the class videographer, hugging and clapping\
      \ each other\u2019s backs. I see James, the class clown, doing the same with\
      \ his best friend from 5th grade. It\u2019s such an emotional scene that I\u2019\
      m frozen - all I can do is look around and smile for these amazing young people.\
      \ To be in this room is to experience the purest and most acute sense of joy\
      \ and possibility. I leave the graduation feeling uplifted and energetic, hoping\

      \ been overwhelmed with the news of violence in this country and throughout\
      \ the world. The feeling of hopelessness, anger and frustration is permeating,\
      \ which only leads to more violence. I believe much of this stems from the stories\
      \ and images we see, and the stories of black men and women are far too often\
      \ negative and violent. This is not my experience at all - the students that\

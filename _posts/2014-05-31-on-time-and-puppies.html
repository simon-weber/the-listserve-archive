      <p>This is not a sad story. I have learned, over time, that missing someone
      is not that bad. In fact, if I can resume my life so far, this is what I can
      say about it for sure: missing someone, be it a father who died, a friend who
      left you or the one that got away, is something that somehow pushes you forward
      &amp; upward, in all the right ways you need to be as a person.</p>

      <p>What I miss about my dad the most is probably the things he missed, too.
      Like seeing me graduate high school. Or college. Seeing me get a job and then
      quit it. Seeing me heartbroken.</p>

      <p>I miss him on my birthday. And on his. And I still write to him on March
      19th, every year.</p>

      <p>A good friend one day told me how lucky I am for all the things I have left
      of my dad. My passion for reading, my career choices, my love for eyewear, my
      collection of toy bunnies, the stories he told me, the ones he wrote. If I leave

      <p>2: Most of the time, I''m walking the fuzzy line that separates a lot of

      a type Six) that summed it up perfectly: No matter what is said about a Six,

      <p>3: Moms. My favorite thing about mine is that I didn''t even realize until
      I left for college that a lot of the words she uses aren''t&#8230; common? The

      <p>4: Small towns can be so charming! They have a story, a past, and their inhabitants

      things like the annual Strawberry Festival, that cat that''s always around&#8211;
      they''re the heart and soul of the place.</p>

      <p>5: I''ve been working for a fair trade clothing company for two years now,
      but I''ll admit that before I started, I easily forgot that humans make clothing.
      Hands made what you''re wearing right now. Fingers pushed that seam through
      a sewing machine, and with International Women''s Day right around the corner,
      wouldn''t you like to know that those fingers belong to a woman who''s paid
      fairly and works in a safe environment? And can in turn provide for her family?
      The fair trade community is the small town of the garment industry&#8211; search

      <p>But enough about me: if you want to tell me 1 or, hey, even 2 of the following
      things, email me at tellmelotsofthings@gmail.com.<br />I want to know:</p>

      <p>1: Your favorite small towns (and why). I grew up in one and I want to visit
      more&#8211; international small towns appreciated, as long as they''ll welcome
      me.</p>

      <p>2: Your favorite thing about your mom. Also accepted: a specific story OR
      over-arching great-thing about your mom OR grandma, aunt, friend, doesn''t matter.
      I like focusing on the good parts of people and I''d love to hear what you have

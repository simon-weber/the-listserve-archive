    \ ones, free ones, expensive ones, exclusive ones and niche ones. For the last\
    \ 6 years, on and off.\r\n\r\nThe one thing they have in common is that they're\
    \ mostly rotten and dishonest. I'd say they're giving the industry a bad name,\
    \ but they *are* the industry, and that's the problem.\r\n\r\nDating sites started\
    \ in the 90s with good intentions. In the 00s, it all started going wrong. Smaller\
    \ sites had to look big, so they made fake profiles and sent fake messages to\
    \ their users to grab their subscription money. And unfortunately, nothing's really\
    \ changed. If you live in the UK you might even have seen a Panorama documentary\
    \ about it recently.\r\n\r\nFree sites are spam-ridden cattlemarkets, where men\
    \ send huge amounts of degrading, filthy and often bizarre messages to women,\
    \ whose inboxes are so full that the genuine down-to-earth good guys are drowned\
    \ out. Generally, if you're not willing to pay to find a match, your heart's not\
    \ really in it (pun intended!).\r\n\r\nThen the subscription-only sites are the\
    \ way to go, right? Except they don't tell you when your matches were last online,\
    \ they will often send pretend profile views and messages your way, and restrict\
    \ anything that would allow you an informed choice - until you hand over your\
    \ credit card info, at which point, you realise the three people you had your\
    \ eye on have long moved on (or don't subscribe, and thus won't reply) - or that\
    \ those messages you received weren't even real.\r\n\r\nI'm probably preaching\
    \ to the choir here. If you're dating online, you've already encountered all this\
    \ I have no doubt. And it might seem like there's no choice, and that's largely\
    \ true, as companies have to make a profit somewhere.\r\n\r\nSo I got sick of\
    \ this, having dated online for years and learned of all the nasty tricks of the\
    \ trade, and now I'm building my own site. It's called opendating dot co dot uk,\
    \ and it will launch later this year. I'm really hoping to build something that\
    \ will shake up the industry and give those evil big boys a run for their money.\
    \ There will be no subscriptions, no fakes, and daters will have all the information\
    \ they need about their matches before they hand any money over. It's going to\
    \ be morally just and ethically minded, and I'm really excited at the thought\
    \ of doing something that just feels *right*.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested, please\
    \ do get in touch, especially if you're an online dater (or have been). I'd love\
    \ to throw ideas around with any like-minded people, and your feedback really\
    \ would be SO welcome. Tell me your tales of online dating woes. Any stories from\
    \ people that have been successful while online dating would be lovely too - I\
    \ know it's not all bad!\r\n\r\nOh and of course, sign up if you're looking for\
    \ love. Perhaps I can be your Cupid... :)\r\n\r\n\r\nTom Haczewski\t\r\nemail@tomhaczewski.co.uk\t\

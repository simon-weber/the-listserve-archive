    body: '<p>Digital Health</p>

      <p>Two of my greatest passions are digital and health. I&#8217;m most excited
      when these two things can be combined - when we use digital solutions to get
      people active, to empower them to make decisions about their healthcare, to
      surface information they need when they need it, to help them live happier,
      healthier, simpler lives. Between innovative startups, large corporations making
      big moves, and public health organizations that are embracing these changes,
      there is a lot of exciting work underway. I would love to connect and share
      ideas with others in the industry.</p>

      <p>Feminism</p>

      <p>I am trying to be a better feminist. I am a passionate feminist, but I have
      a lot to learn. I&#8217;ve learned the most by reading books by women, particularly
      women of colour. I&#8217;ve loved exploring the minds of Rupi Kaur, bell hooks
      and Hanya Yanagihara. What is your favourite book by a WOC?</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve just started reading a book called the Feminist Utopia Project
      that shares the visions of feminist utopias by a variety of women. Women, I&#8217;d
      love to know, what&#8217;s your feminist utopia?</p>

      <p>Recommendation #1: The Depanneur</p>

      <p>Check out Newcomer Kitchen at The Depanneur in Toronto. They have created
      a space for Syrian refugees to cook together and share their cuisine with the
      city. It&#8217;s a beautiful initiative.</p>

      <p>Recommendation #2: Hanya Yanagihara</p>

      <p>A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara is a beautifully written, heart wrenching
      novel and is my absolute favourite, miles ahead of any of the other books I
      have ever read. I am mesmerized by the way she strings together words, sentences,
      paragraphs. I have never read anything more pleasing.</p>

      <p>&#8230;</p>

      <p>If you want to chat about digital health, feminism or books (or a combination
      of these things), shoot me an email.</p>

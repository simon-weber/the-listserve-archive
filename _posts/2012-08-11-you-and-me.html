      <p>You are worthy of love no matter what. You hold no dark secret, no horrible
      regret nor difference of opinion that lessens your value. You are important,
      you mean something, you deserve love. Further, what you believe, think and do
      are significant. You and I believe some true and false things, but we choose
      what we believe and how we live. And these choices matter.</p>

      <p>Despite our significance, however, something about the world still isn''t
      right. And I have questions.</p>

      <p>I believe you and I are more than smart animals, but who are we? I believe
      death brings more than nonexistence, but what? I believe the standard of right
      and wrong comes from somewhere outside ourselves, but where? I believe God designed
      us and allows us to mess up, but loves us anyway and saves us through Jesus
      Christ. I don''t understand it all, and I have doubts and questions, but I believe
      it''s true and means a great deal to you and me.</p>

      <p>Thanks for your time.</p>

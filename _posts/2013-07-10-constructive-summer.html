      \ and shifted the way I saw the world. That book was Pulitzer-winning journalist\
      \ Tracy Kidder\u2019s biography of Dr. Paul Farmer, Mountains Beyond Mountains.\
      \ Briefly, it chronicles Dr. Farmer\u2019s experiences administering healthcare\
      \ to impoverished patients in Haiti, Russia and Peru during the 90\u2019s, but\
      \ more importantly it illuminates the vast health inequities our world faced\
      \ then and still faces now. It introduced to me the concepts of structural violence\
      \ and the oppression of the poor, and bluntly asked me to face some very unsettling\
      \ truths. For example, after administering antibiotics to an impoverished TB\
      \ patient who had been suffering for months, Paul wrote, \u201CWhen she received\
      \ them, she soon began to respond- almost as if she had a treatable infectious\
      \ disease.\u201D  I hope that quotation makes you uncomfortable; it should.\
      \ We live in a world where people die of treatable diseases because money is\
      \ not allocated for their cure. How can we change that?\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t\
      \ possibly sit here and dispense advice on solving these problems because they\
      \ are immensely complex issues with roots in politics, economics, and technology.\
      \ What makes the Listserve such a phenomenal project is that it offers the incomparable\
      \ opportunity to connect to so many incredible, talented people with such vastly\
      \ different experiences, skillsets, and worldviews. All of whom are now at my\
      \ fingertips, reading the words and thoughts I think are important enough to\
      \ express. No pressure. But since I\u2019ve been given this opportunity, I\u2019\
      ll share a bit about where I\u2019m coming from so that I can invite you all\
      \ to think seriously about some interesting questions and hopefully let me ask\
      \ for your ideas in return.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a graduate student, distance runner,\
      \ and aspiring mountaineer. I\u2019ve logged serious hours in most of the national\
      \ parks of the American West. I\u2019m currently working towards my PhD studying\
      \ genome instability and recombination in yeast as a model for cancer. I find\
      \ my project endlessly fascinating, and am now using next-generation sequencing\
      \ technology to detect individual chromosome rearrangements. Ultimately, I want\
      \ to work at the intersection of science and global health, but when it comes\
      \ to the arc of my career, I\u2019m still trying to determine precisely where\
      \ I want to be. Over the last few years I\u2019ve been trying to develop a skillset\
      \ that extends beyond the arena of scientific research, interning for a well-established\
      \ NGO, learning a programming language, and working on the policy side of drug\
      \ accessibility with an organization targeting patent agreements. I\u2019m hoping\
      \ to participate in a program that will allow me to spend time conducting clinical\
      \ research in a developing country because I understand how formative such an\
      \ experience would be.\r\n\r\nOverall, I\u2019m trying to get a grasp of the\
      \ more significant needs and gaps in global health, international development,\
      \ and antipoverty efforts that someone like me could fill. What applications\
      \ do you see for science and genetics outside of basic research?\r\n\r\nI\u2019\
      d love to hear from people in the field, people who have created their own fields,\
      \ and people who are in no way related to the field but have advice on shaping\
      \ a career that is challenging on a daily basis but is also truly bent on improving\
      \ the human condition across the world.\r\n\r\nFor those also struggling through\

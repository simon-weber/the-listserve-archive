      <p>I am writing all of you from this little place called Zipaquir&#225;, Colombia.
      Tomorrow, wednesday the 6th of March, marks my 8 weeks anniversary! 8 weeks
      of living in another country, fulfilling one of my dreams, and finally living
      outside the city I''ve been born and raised in for the first time ever! (Leiden,
      the Netherlands, is however a beautiful, lovely, lively and amazing little place!
      Make sure to check it out.)</p>

      <p>Back in 2014/2015 I spent 7 months over here in South-America. I didn''t
      actually finish my studies yet, but hey- I did already buy my tickets. And that
      thesis wasn''t going anywhere anyway. South-America was my very last continent
      to visit, as I chose it to be. I had this idea it was scary, daunting and you
      must be at least completely fluent in Spanish to survive. Ofcourse, after arriving
      back in October 2014 I fell in love straight away, and knew I wanted to go back
      as soon as I could.</p>

      <p>So here I am, working for a NGO in Zipa, giving English lessons and going
      on all these new adventures during my weekends off. I would love to tell all
      of you about these, exploring this beautiful country and continent. How Brazil
      is a rollercoaster every day, which in the end gives for the best memories.
      How I finally learned Spanish hitchhiking through Patagonia with 4 of my newly-found
      Argentinean girlfriends, or so I thought. Until I got picked up by some lovely
      Chileans..</p>

      <p>Stories are best told face to face however, especially in combination with

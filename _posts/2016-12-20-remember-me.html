      \ family that her father started to applause at the end of the video. :)\r\n\
      \r\nNow, I am happily and thankfully married with the perfect lady, Suheyla\
      \ who gave me a son, Kutay Mete, last spring. We were in \u0130stanbul and after\
      \ his birth we have moved to our hometown, \xC7orum. We wanted him to have a\
      \ good enough childhood to learn the names of the animals and plants not from\
      \ the TV but from the nature. Having travelled in Europe several times, we are\
      \ seeking for chances to start living there \u2013in a world of refugees\u2026\

      \ your opportunities. Living in Turkey, we wake up to a shocking incident everyday.\
      \ We don\u2019t want our son to live through this. You got it.\r\n\r\nCurrently,\
      \ I am working at a public education center that provides both personal and\

      \nSuheyla is working at a public secondary school as a councellor. She is also\

      \ for the children of the refugess living in \xC7orum. (By the way, people of\

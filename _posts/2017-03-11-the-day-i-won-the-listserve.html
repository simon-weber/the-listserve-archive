    body: "The first alarm goes off at 5am.  This is the reminder to take my temperature,\
      \ the most recent chore in 2.5 years of trying to get pregnant with our second\
      \ child.  I have turned off the alarm every day for the last week, since I went\
      \ on a trip, left my thermometer in my travel bag, and woke up the next morning\
      \ to realize that I didn't care enough to continue the exercise in futility\
      \ to go retrieve it.  This morning, guilt lies heavy on me, for giving up on\
      \ my body, for giving up on the child we wanted so badly we already have a name\
      \ chosen.  I am awake when my wife's alarm goes off, and she rolls over to hug\
      \ me. Two rounds of IVF, 6 of IUI, surgeries and so many shots and pills.  Boxes\
      \ of maternity and infant clothes in our closet.  \u201CI think I\u2019m ready\
      \ to give up\u201D, I tell her.\r\n\r\nWe rise, and I am in the shower when\
      \ our nearly four-year-old son comes in crying, \u201CYou were supposed to still\
      \ be in bed when I woke up!\u201D  My wife comforts him, then heads out to do\
      \ morning chores in the barn:  feed our flock of 40 chickens and 5 turkeys,\
      \ open the barn doors for our 8 dairy goats, and walk our two sheep and their\
      \ 3 bouncing lambs to a pasture.  Inside, I start a fire in the wood stove,\
      \ cook breakfast, and wrangle our son into clothes and a slightly less crazy\
      \ hairdo.\r\n\r\nBy 9:30 I have dropped the child at school, caught up on email,\
      \ and completed a conference call with Italy from my rented office, a little\
      \ room in a little building on the main street of the small town that is the\
      \ biggest near our farm.  I work remotely for a massive international company,\
      \ and I am grateful every day for the flexibility and support my job provides.\
      \  Today, I take advantage of it by pivoting to work on a project for the local\
      \ group I have been helping to lead since my world was shaken by the election.\
      \  I am determined to make my female, queer, mixed-race family more visible\
      \ in my community to let those who voted for Trump see who their vote harmed.\
      \  I\u2019ll finish sending emails later tonight, before Italy wakes up.\r\n\
      \r\nAt 11:30, I meet a friend for a celebratory lunch:  after a year of hard\
      \ work by our board, the tiny, private, nonprofit school that we are creating\
      \ has received $10k in donations AND official approval of non-profit status\
      \ from the IRS this week.  I am so proud of her, and of this project, and I\
      \ am so excited to welcome our first students to this innovative education model\
      \ this fall.\r\n\r\nAfter lunch, I take a little time to prepare for an upcoming\
      \ board meeting of our rural water cooperative. I am President of the board,\
      \ a title that means I must lead the often contentious Annual Member Meeting\
      \ at the end of this month. I\u2019m dreading this, and I contemplate again\
      \ the possibility that I was elected to this position as punishment for all\
      \ my inconvenient questions.\r\n\r\nAt bedtime, we are brushing teeth and our\
      \ son asks me if I am old.  I say well, today I feel kind of old, and he turns\
      \ his enormous brown eyes to me and says, 'Mama, are you going to die?'.\r\n\
      \r\nNot anytime soon, I say, and he says, \"oh, so I will be old enough to cook\

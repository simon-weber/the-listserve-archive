      \ in general are great.  I grew up playing games like Pinochle and Michigan\
      \ Rummy and have taught my friends how to play them.  One of my favorite card\

      \ mess with each other in knock-out mode.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m also a huge fan of\
      \ Dungeons & Dragons.  D&D is a table-top role playing game where you make a\
      \ character and play through a campaign of the dungeon masters choosing.  I\
      \ get together with my friends every other weekend to play and next weekend\
      \ is my first time as dungeon master.  I\u2019m really excited but also really\
      \ nervous.\r\n\r\nLaura\t\r\nzorpox08@aim.com\t\r\nBensalem, PA\r\n\r\n"

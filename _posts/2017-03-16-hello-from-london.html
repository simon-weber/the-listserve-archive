      \ rhetoric in the public sphere at present is scary and almost prehistoric,\

      \ but time heals.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tSay what you mean, and mean what you say. Too\

      \ to change things if they aren\u2019t working. I had what was best described\
      \ as a career existential crisis at 25 and swapped degrees and years of work\
      \ in psychology for a career in advertising. Whilst I work longer hours, I\u2019\
      m much happier and satisfied. Don\u2019t ignore your red flags.\r\n\r\n\u2022\
      \tPlease, please don\u2019t text and drive. We lost my 3-year-old goddaughter\

    body: "Hi everyone! My name is Ben and I am a 20 year old American college student\
      \ hailing from the bustling metropolis that is North Bend, Washington. I actually\
      \ attend university in Washington, D.C. where I am double majoring in International\
      \ Affairs and German.\r\n            Now that you at least know a few things\
      \ about me, I\u2019d like for you to go back to the subject line and read it\
      \ over again. It is my opinion that to know a person, and I mean really understand\
      \ what makes them tick, you must know what they are most afraid of. In the above\
      \ paragraph I told you some basic information about myself, but all of that\
      \ doesn\u2019t really show who I am or what I am like.\r\n\r\nI am terrified\
      \ of being forgotten.\r\n\r\nHow about now? Know me a little better? I hope\
      \ so. Let me give you a little insight into the depths of my fear.\r\nMy fear\
      \ motivates everything that I do.\r\nIt\u2019s why I moved 3,000 miles away\
      \ to continue my education. Staying in my hometown with the same 5,000 people\
      \ doesn\u2019t lend itself to the kind of life changing feats as does moving\
      \ to a city with a population of over 120 times that. I wanted a chance to meet\
      \ people I would never have the chance to meet if I had stayed in the region\
      \ my entire life. I wanted to embrace the kind of change in myself that I hoped\

      \r\nMy fear is why I volunteer in my community and in others wherever I can.\
      \ It\u2019s why I spent a week in New Orleans building a house with Habitat\
      \ for Humanity in the lower 9th ward for a former carney (and human blockhead!!)\
      \ who lost his home during Hurricane Katrina. It\u2019s why I\u2019m going back\
      \ again this coming winter.\r\nIt\u2019s why I worry so much about what people\

      \ remember someone who is boring, or a jerk. Who would want to remember that\
      \ person? Who would want to remember some short kid who looks 5 years younger\
      \ than he actually is? Even now writing an email to 25,000 strangers I wonder\

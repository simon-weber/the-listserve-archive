      \nYou see, growing up this way, however, taught me the one guarantee: death\

      I found myself often thinking of the life after death\u2014if there even was\

      \ my story,\r\n\r\nI grew up thinking I wasn\u2019t worth anything\u2014thinking\
      \ this world was better off without me. I grew up wanting to be rid of the pain\

      chose to spare me from the just penalty of my depravity: hell. It wasn\u2019\

    body: "My boyfriend says that to know me, you have to understand 3 things: I love\
      \ the beach, I live for Texas Football, and above everything else, I love my\
      \ Abuela.  She is my favorite person in the world.\r\n\r\nFor those of you who\
      \ don\u2019t know, Abuela is Spanish for grandmother and mine is top notch.\
      \  When I was five and my favorite movie was Mary Poppins, Abuela promised me\
      \ to take me to feed the birds at St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral.  She did so much\
      \ more \u2013 she took me to Spain, England and France on an almost month long\
      \ and amazing trip. You couldn't feed the birds anymore at St. Paul's Cathedral,\
      \ but that didn't slow us down.\r\n\r\nWhen I was thirteen, she retired and\
      \ moved to Austin, where I grew up. I think she knew how much my little brother\
      \ and I would need her \u2013 my parents separated 8 months later and her house,\
      \ just 2 miles from mine, became a much needed oasis. At 18, I decided to defer\
      \ college and join AmeriCorps, a decision that wasn\u2019t well received by\
      \ my parents, but she supported me.  When I was 23 and wanted to move across\
      \ the country to be with the man I adore, she said \u201Cgo and be happy.\u201D\
      \r\n\r\nShe taught me that even though people might not treat you well, you\
      \ should still treat them with kindness and dignity.\r\n\r\nShe taught me patience\
      \ through knitting and that you can always fix a mistake without taking out\
      \ the last 10 rows.\r\n\r\nShe taught me how to shuffle a deck of cards and\
      \ that you don't come to the card table without money.\r\n\r\nShe taught me\
      \ that Thanksgiving was the best holiday because, it\u2019s not about things,\
      \ it\u2019s about people and being gracious for what you have. I will always\
      \ cherish our pre-Thanksgiving Chinese food dinners and how she would turn the\
      \ AC on in November so my homemade hot chocolate would warm me while we watched\
      \ the Thanksgiving Day parade.\r\n\r\nShe taught me that good friends were more\
      \ important than many friends. She always insisted that it was going to be those\
      \ good friends that get you through the toughest times. She's right. I went\
      \ home a few weeks ago, after Abuela was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer.\
      \  She's fighting against some ridiculous odds, but at 84, she's winning.  It's\
      \ wonderful.  She has the most amazing group of friends helping her and I have\
      \ a great group supporting me.\r\n\r\nI want to move home to spend time with\
      \ her, take her to doctor\u2019s appointment, and to be sure someone is there\
      \ when she needs a hand. I'm excited about this opportunity -- I get to care\
      \ for my favorite person, but I'm also scared.  I would be leaving my boyfriend\
      \ of seven years and well-paying job for something unknown.  Any advice?\r\n\

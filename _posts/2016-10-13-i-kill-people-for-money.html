      I wrote the movies Severance, Cockneys Vs Zombies, Tower Block, TV episodes\

      \nWhen people find out what I've written, their first question is usually \"\
      \"do you write the whole story, or just the dialogue?\"\" Yes, when I write\
      \ scripts, I do both the story and the dialogue. Everything you see and hear\
      \ on screen, has to be in the script first, otherwise they don't know what sets\
      \ to build, what people say, and what happens. Obviously there is some improvisation\
      \ on set, things change, but it all starts with a script.\r\n\r\nIt's a strange\
      \ job. You work alone, writing, for weeks, occasionally meeting the team for\
      \ feedback if you're on something that's in production. If you're directing,\
      \ you have a short burst of shooting before you disappear into a dark room to\
      \ edit, grade, do the sound, fx, etc. And then you unleash it on an unsuspecting\
      \ audience.\r\n\r\nThe most stressful part is just before it's released. Suddenly,\
      \ you start second guessing yourself. What if everyone hates it? I'm a fraud.\
      \ I'm terrible. I'm ugly. I smell. My career is over. But then you see your\
      \ work unfold on screen, and all the hard work and worries are worth it. And\
      \ you remember why you do this: to give people something entertaining, something\
      \ they'll be talking about the next day.\r\n\r\nAnd that's why it's the best\
      \ job in the world. Even if nobody quite understands it.\r\n\r\nMy current project\
      \ coincides with me winning the Listserve lottery - it's a webseries, which\
      \ has just started airing the first season online, so I'm still in the \"\"\
      worry\"\" phase. The hardest part of doing a webseries is letting people know\
      \ it exists, so I'd love it if you had a look. It's a modernised, vlog-style\
      \ adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula (I'm trying not to say \"\"Vladaptation\"\
      \"). I've flipped the characters around so that Mina and Lucy are the heroes\
      \ instead of the boys, it's a funnier, more self aware take, with plenty of\
      \ left turns - even if you think you know the story, you'll have some surprises\
      \ along the way.\r\n\r\nAnd obviously, because it's Dracula, not everyone will\
      \ make it to the end in one piece. But you'll have to wait and see. It's called\
      \ Mina Murray's Journal (minasjournal[dot]com), if you check out the show's\
      \ Twitter account at @MinasJournal or mine at @JamesMoran then you'll find the\
      \ links. If you like it, please like, subscribe, and/or pass it on to someone\
      \ else that might like it! These things live or die on word of mouth, and it's\
      \ very much a labour of love for me, so I really want people to see it.\r\n\r\
      \nThanks for reading this, I hope you enjoy some of my work (some of which is\
      \ on Netflix, DVD, etc). And thanks to PJ Holden for introducing me to the Listserve!\r\

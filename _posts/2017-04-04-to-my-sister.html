      \ because I believe only she could be the one to write it. She doesn\u2019t\
      \ see herself in this way, and thus her essence has never been documented on\

      \ and the women who will surround her on that journey. I think about you, Allie.\
      \ I hope she has your bravery and allows herself to be courageously vulnerable\
      \ like you do. I hope she laughs with her entire body and can feel joy just\

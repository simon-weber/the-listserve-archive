    body: "Another wave crashes down. Under a tumbling wave the salt water fizzles\

      \ My lungs are full and it makes me smile.\r\n\r\nI feel this often. After exams;\
      \ after moving from one home to another; one country to another; after leaving\
      \ graduation as a post-grad but entering into another kind of grad. I wave to\
      \ my friends with jobs who live in independence where they put hours into projects\
      \ like CommuniGift. They utterly live for someone else. They are committed to\
      \ goodness that they haven\u2019t seen but absolutely see. Vision for the not-yet\

      \ Even in my walk to the one place I can go to start my day and think clearly\
      \ at 6am every morning in Chiang Mai, Thailand. It is consistently open and\
      \ has free 4-hours of wifi with the purchase of an overpriced espresso that\
      \ makes me bitter. But the air conditioning, oh, the air conditioning. I\u2019\
      ve realized it is the real secret ingredient to S-V-O\u2026 not all-nighters\
      \ or office hours or memorization. The first time I sipped the coffee, tears\
      \ fell from my face. For so many reasons, it this place is my only option.\r\
      \n\r\nFaith is freeing when it is not dependent on me. With floating steps I\
      \ can walk there. Every day I start burdened trying to lead a team and change\
      \ their complaints to positivity. I feel the pressure of trying to make every\
      \ day a memorable experience that will make them say It was worth it after 51\
      \ days in a place where we are asked to walk through the conversations with\
      \ people who don\u2019t know the speech sounds a, and, and the have meaning.\
      \ But in that coffeeshop I sit on the mats on the floor, bruising my tailbone\
      \ further, feeling my legs prickle as my circulation becomes more limited, and\
      \ I change. Over truth, Burden and Pressure and Weight become Light and Free\
      \ and I float like the butterflies at 6am.\r\n\r\nAnd even though it sounds\
      \ cheesy, it is true, love is the common denominator and the truth that changes\
      \ people from the inside out. And evil and hatred and shootings and shame exists\
      \ in any pocket of this planet but love is deeper still. I\u2019ve seen it change\
      \ a calloused soul. One carrying the guilt of death. One so scared of her own\
      \ thoughts and words. One who is so determined to make up for herself that she\
      \ was too tired to live. Little by little, she is still changing.\r\n\r\nBut\
      \ the faith in someone else who lived for her brought her to rest. To joy. To\
      \ Chiang Mai to tell friends about love that changes people and never ends,\
      \ like an infinite fountain that sends waves to crash down on the earth. Though\
      \ I can\u2019t always see it, sometimes blinded by the wave itself, the fountain\
      \ changes color from red like scarlet to white as snow. It\u2019s changed me\
      \ from red like scarlet to white as snow.\r\n\r\n\r\nErin Rolandelli\r\nerolandelli1@gmail.com\r\

      <p>BE AWARE OF YOUR OWN PRIVILEGE.</p>

      <p>I''m a well-off white male who can afford to live in one of the greatest
      places in the world and hold down a steady, semi-inspiring job. Moneyed itinerancy,
      grad school and motivational speaking aren''t for me, but they''re all within

      <p>Since the Listserve flock is self-selected, it makes sense that most of you
      would share at least some of the same privilege. Just do me a favor: step back
      for a second and recognize what you have. Then realize how it informs your everyday
      interactions with the people you meet, and for god''s sake, do something constructive
      with it.</p>

      <p>Maybe instead of sharing the same personal advice columns or superficial
      first-day-of-summer-camp facts about yourself, do a little soul-searching --
      the kind that doesn''t involve ''Chicken Soup,'' you know? Then report back
      with what you''ve learned.</p>

      <p>I''d take my own advice but I think I''m over the word count...</p>

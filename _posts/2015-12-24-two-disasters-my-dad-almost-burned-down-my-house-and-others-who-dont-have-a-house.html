      \  They build schools in rural villages and have for 10 years.  In April, the\
      \ earthquake destroyed a place that hardly had anything to begin with.  In June,\
      \ we had Seattle wedding.  Instead of a registry we encouraged donations to\
      \ our friend\u2019s charity.  Google \u201Ccrowdrise bkrainier\u201D for more\
      \ info.\r\n\r\nThe Story:\r\nThe day my father met my (future) wife was literally\
      \ a disaster.  He arrived around lunchtime for a father/son weekend.  My sister\
      \ and mother hadn\u2019t met her yet. I was a week away from telling friends\
      \ \u201Cshe\u2019s the one\u201D  (to which they replied \u201Cyeah we know\u201D\
      ).  First meeting, everyone got along great.   After lunch, she left for friend\u2019\
      s wedding while Dad and I hung out.  Later, he dropped me off to join the wedding\
      \ and planned a \u201Cbachelor night\u201D at my place.  I jokingly muttered,\
      \ \u201CDon\u2019t burn the house down,\u201D as I exited the car!\r\n\r\nWe\
      \ get home post-wedding, Dad\u2019s passed out in the guest room (clothes on)\
      \ having killed a bottle of wine by himself.  We pass out (clothes off) in my\
      \ room.  Two hours later, I wake to 11ft high flames coming in the patio window\
      \ and the smoke detector!  Mind you, we\u2019re on the 3rd floor!  Yelling,\
      \ running, primal things - you\u2019re not supposed to be in the middle of fires.\
      \  I put most of it out with my feet (OUCH!) and a towel, but had to back away\
      \ for air.  Still naked.  She runs out.  Imagine the sight of a naked 6\u2019\
      4\u201D man jumping up and down amongst flames.  Yelling.  Hot.  Dad trundles\
      \ upstairs.  Imagine a 5\u20196 not-small-chested woman jumping around and bending\
      \ over to put out flames in front of her would-be-father-in-law.  Nice to meet\
      \ you. The former fireman grabs a trash can, fills it with water, and fire is\
      \ out.  We find clothes, the fire department arrives, my \u201Cnon-smoker\u201D\
      \ Dad admits he smoked, but flushed the butt.  (Logic says he put it out in\
      \ the too-dry planter, which smoldered for hours until it caught.)  He refused\

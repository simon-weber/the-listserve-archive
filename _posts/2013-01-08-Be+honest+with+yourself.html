<p>2012 was a rough year for me - losing my house, car, credit rating, shifting around friends' places and wasting a bunch of time recovering from technical issues.</p>
<p>It was the culmination of years of almost-sensible decisions. I offer one suggestion to avoid this:</p>
<p>Be honest with yourself.</p>
<p>Look in the mirror every morning and ask "what truth am I hiding from?"</p>
<p>Here are some ways I've been dishonest with myself:<br />=> Living like I was close to great entrepreneurial success with really I had no plan.<br />=> Spending more than I was earning: You don't *need* anything except food and used clothing.<br />=> Enduring a non-constructive relationship - telling yourself "marriage is for life" doesn't make it any happier. Inevitably you'll end up compensating in other ways.<br />=> Focusing on *appearing* successful rather than *being* successful. Who's "meaningful" was I trying to achieve?<br />=> Believing "I'm special" thus ignoring the logical advice of friends & mentors.</p>
<p>This is all obvious stuff. Reaching me as "advice" it didn't digest deep enough. I needed to experience the painful consequences of not "living" it to appreciate in hindsight how I failed to thoroughly practice it.</p>
<p>I'm working hard to be honest in the mirror. Honest with people around me and inviting honesty.</p>
<p>2013 is kicking off without the outward symbols of success I held onto so tightly before, but I feel better about myself than ever.</p>
<p>Happy new year friends.</p>

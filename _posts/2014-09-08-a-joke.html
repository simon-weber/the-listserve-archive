      \ Next, he has to get some flowers, so he heads over the the florist and there's\

      \ Then he heads out to rent a limo. Unfortunately, there's a large limo line\
      \ at the rental office, but he's patient and gets the job done.  Finally, the\
      \ day of the prom comes. The two are dancing happily and his girlfriend is having\
      \ a great time. When the song is over, she asks him to get her some punch, so\
      \ he heads over the the punch table and there is no punch line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\

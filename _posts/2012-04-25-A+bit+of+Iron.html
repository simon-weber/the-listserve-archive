<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To begin, let me say that I live a blessed life, surrounded by<br />friends and family that love and support me. &#160;I attempt to appreciate<br />such great fortune as much as I am able, especially as I have grown<br />older and seen such disparity between friends of mine who do not enjoy<br />my same socioeconomic advantages. &#160;Even now, as I am preparing to<br />leave for college, which promises to be a separate segment of my life<br />entirely, I know I have my parents and friends to look to in times of<br />trouble. &#160;That is not to say I haven't lived without struggle.<br />&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From the onset of my life, at the very inception of my beginning<br />days, I endured disappointment. &#160;I was an unhealthily premature baby,<br />8 weeks ahead of schedule by the doctors shared estimations.<br />Naturally, this made me extremely fragile and unhealthy. &#160;I had to<br />extend my stay in the hospital from a single night to almost two weeks<br />as my parents weighed the magnitude of the reality &#160;they were facing:<br />if their first-born son would die before even leaving his hospital<br />incubator. &#160;I had every device available monitoring my precarious<br />state of health, and I know that my parents listened to every one of<br />my heart beats in an attempt to be somewhat closer to me. &#160;As you may<br />have guessed, I ended up recovering.<br />&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;That was not to be the last of my health problems. &#160;In third and<br />fourth grade I got sick with pneumonia that threatened my life. &#160;My<br />sophomore year of high school, I had what doctors believed at first to<br />be a dangerous heart-arrhythmia from which I would also eventually<br />recover. &#160; And, for good measure, I also had panic attacks so<br />frequently I had to be medicated, and was almost diagnosed with an<br />anxiety disorder.<br />&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;All of these things aside though, what one of my father's childhood<br />friend's posits is that I am able to persevere because of how I began<br />my life. She believes that because I was born so weak and had to<br />fight, that I formed a large part of my person immediately. She<br />believes, and has convinced me to believe, that enduring these<br />struggles so early instilled some bit of iron in me that enabled me to<br />overcome what challenges I faced, especially as they relate to health.<br />&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I in no way think that I'm extraordinary, or otherwise remarkable,<br />but I am thankful for the environment in which I live now. &#160;I'm also<br />pressed to contemplate if my father's friend was correct in that my<br />socialization process was so drastic and so immediate that it formed<br />much of my being. &#160;Regardless, I find it to be a fascinating thought.<br />If we can all seek to find what is a large part of ourselves, perhaps<br />we can use that knowledge to secure better lives for ourselves, each<br />other, and our children. &#160;If I can do so, I give all appreciation and<br />thanks to those who have made my life full of wonder. &#160;Only the<br />mistakes have been mine.</p>

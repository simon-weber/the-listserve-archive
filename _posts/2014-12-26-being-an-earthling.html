      <p>Firstly, thanks to Listserve HQ friends for the chance to say something to
      the global community.  Even if it''s random choice, it''s still an honour to
      be given the opportunity to write, as well as to read.</p>

      <p>For my moment of your time, I''d like to remind you of the first-ever photo,
      taken from the Moon in 1969, of planet Earth.  What an extraordinary thing that
      was to see - the view of the home of Earthlings that our neighbours would have,
      if there were such creatures.  Suddenly the whole, huge, complex, busy and taken-for-granted
      thing you and I live on and rarely think about, probably, was seen hanging unsupported
      in dark empty space, looking delicate, fragile even - just a small blue-green
      empty-looking ball, where in fact all life as we know it started, and still
      exists.</p>

      <p>Being an Earthling is an interesting idea, I believe.  You and I are members
      of a single human race, and seeing Earth as one entity in that photo - a single
      atom in a vast, endless universe - suggests that there''s much more to link

      frontiers, even countries?  All that naming the bits of the planet we each inhabit

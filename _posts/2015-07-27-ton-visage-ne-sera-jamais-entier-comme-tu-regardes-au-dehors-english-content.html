      <p>One thing I discovered lately was meeting different people. Growing up in
      a small city, I used to stay with the same friends for years. Because of my
      studies, I went to increasingly large cities, but still met people in the same
      fields or having the same interest. Friendship was an important part of my comfort
      zone. I felt more and more trapped in my world, seeing people with the same
      background, the same interests, the same view, the same goal in life.<br />One
      day, I finally decided to stop. I went on holiday, broke up with my boyfriend,
      moved to another place and started a new job. I had the opportunity to work
      in an environment with people from different cultures, having done diverse things
      in their life and seeing the world differently. I also started volunteering
      for several associations, discovering a new life in a city I thought I knew
      well. I''ve since then met various people, some deeply engaged in changing the
      world however they can, others with a unique point of view on topics I never
      really thought about in depth. I discovered new lifestyles, out of my comfort
      zone, which made me reconsider the choices I''ve made so far. They helped me
      to reflect on the life I want to live and the values I want to defend. They
      taught me to respect people and their opinions, and how to communicate better.
      I owe them&#160; so much I don''t have the words to thank them enough for what
      they gave me.<br />Now, one of the consequences of all these meetings is my
      future move to Australia next year. I''m still struggling to choose where I''ll

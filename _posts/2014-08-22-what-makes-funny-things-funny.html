      <p>The root of all humor is "the swerve". This is an element of surprise built
      into the structure of a joke which pulls the audience off of the implied path
      into a punchline. The strength of a joke is related to how strongly the implied
      path is set and then how well you can craft a swerve that people can follow.</p>

      <p>The simplest joke I know of to use a swerve is a form of comic triple: a
      to-do list joke ("my weekend projects: 1- fix door, 2- sweep garage, 3- kill
      my wife"). The first two items establish a straight line to follow and the third
      swerves from it in a surprising way.</p>

      <p>Jokes can also intentionally not swerve, and exploit an audience''s expectation
      of a swerve to form the surprise element.</p>

      <p>One of my favorite types of jokes is latvian joke which as far as I can tell
      was invented by a guy named Chris Connolly, so (congratulate/get mad at) him
      for it, not me:</p>

      <p>"Joke: Man is hungry. He steal bread to feed family. Get home, find all family
      have sent Siberia! ''More bread for me,'' man think. But bread have worm."</p>

      <p>The end.</p>

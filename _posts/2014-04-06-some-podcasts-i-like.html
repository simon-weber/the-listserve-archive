      \ art form, above movies, tv, books, music, paintings, and cat gifs is podcasts.\
      \ That\u2019s not to say that I don\u2019t love all those other things (especially\
      \ cat gifs) but my podcast obsession trumps all.\r\n\_\r\nAnd I like to think\
      \ I know a good bit about podcasts, since I listen regularly to 45 of them.\
      \ Which is too many. Like, seriously too many. I have to listen to most of them\
      \ on 1.5 or 2x speed, and even then I end up with a huge backlog of episodes.Eventually\
      \ I go through a purge where I just delete some old episodes and move on. There\u2019\
      s probably something poetic about that. Someone could probably make that a metaphor\
      \ for an aspect of life.\r\n\r\n\_\r\nWhatever.\r\n\_\r\nAnyway, here are my\
      \ top ten favorite podcasts:\r\n\_\r\n10) Pop My Culture: Improvisers Cole Stratton\
      \ and Vanessa Ragland talk about the week\u2019s happenings in pop culture with\
      \ a celebrity guest. It\u2019s fun, it\u2019s silly, and it\u2019s always a\
      \ blast.\r\n\_\r\n9) The Mental Illness Happy Hour: Comedian Paul Gilmartin\
      \ talks to guests of all kinds, from comedians to listeners to therapists, about\
      \ mental health. The show is amazingly touching and has truly some of the best,\
      \ most honest and open interviews I\u2019ve ever heard.\r\n\_\r\n8) How Did\
      \ This Get Made? Comedians Paul Scheer, June Diane Rapheal, and Jason Mantzoukas,\
      \ along with another guest, all watch a terrible movie and spend an hour breaking\
      \ it down.\r\n\_\r\n7) Scriptnotes: Screenwriters John August and Craig Mazin\
      \ spend an hour every week talking in-depth about various aspects of screenwriting.\r\
      \n\_\r\n6) Doug Loves Movies: Comedian (noticing a theme?) Doug Benson runs\
      \ a live movie-themed game show, featuring a rotating panel of awesomely funny\
      \ comedians, actors, and the occasional musician.\r\n\_\r\n5) The Indoor Kids:\
      \ Comedian (it\u2019s gonna keep going on like this\u2026) Kumail Nanjiani and\
      \ his wife Emily Gordon host the best video game podcast. I don\u2019t even\
      \ really play video games and I still love the show.\r\n\_\r\n4) You Made It\
      \ Weird: Comedian (I really like comedy. Deal.) Pete Holmes does crazy-long,\
      \ crazy-in-depth interviews with one guest per week (usually a comedian.) They\
      \ talk about the big stuff.\r\n\_\r\n3) The Nerdist: Hosted by uber-nerd Christ\
      \ Hardwick, it\u2019s got excellent interviews with all kinds of great personalities,\
      \ and has a really fun, enthusiastic, and friendly vibe.\r\n\_\r\n2) Welcome\
      \ To Night Vale: No description would do it justice, just listen and hear for\
      \ yourself. All I will say is that it is beyond incredible. And stay out of\
      \ the Dog Park.\r\n\_\r\n1) Harmontown: Consistently the funniest 2 hours of\
      \ my week. Community creator Dan Harmon and his friends do a goofy, off the\
      \ rails, town-hall-esque live show every week that features rapping, ranting,\
      \ and Dungeons & Dragons. It\u2019s the best.\r\n\_\r\nSome others that I recommend\
      \ checking out: Alison Rosen Is Your New Best Friend, The Nerdist Writers Panel,\
      \ Before You Were Funny, FeaB, Jonah Raydio, Who Charted, The Big Pull, James\
      \ Bonding, and The Alton Browncast.\r\n\_\r\nIf you have podcasts to recommend,\
      \ or just want to say hi (or have an internship to give a college computer science\
      \ sophomore interested in writing and producing for film/tv/internet/radio\u2026\
      ) email me, or hit me up on twitter (@AndrewTheWhip)\r\n\_\r\nAnd if you like\
      \ music and vlogs, check me on the YouTubes (TheAndrewWhipple) and, much more\
      \ importantly, check my ridiculously talented friends Hannah Moroz and Kirstyn\
      \ Hippe.\r\n\_\r\n(Meow.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrew Whipple\r\nandrewwhipplelistserve@gmail.com\r\

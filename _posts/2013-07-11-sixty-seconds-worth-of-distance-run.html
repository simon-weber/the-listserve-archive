      \  I turn 43 next week and I\u2019d like to go back to school, get an engineering\

      \ energy into something that will make a concrete difference in the lives of\
      \ others.  I\u2019d like to use my talents to help others achieve more than\

      \ the challenges seem so monumental that they've frozen any real progress for\
      \ literally years.  I'm afraid of failing.  I\u2019m afraid of succeeding and\
      \ it not being what I imagined it would be.  How am I going to pay for school?\
      \  Is it smart to take out loans?  It is the right thing to do to leave a profession\

      \ and tell you how to live your life.  I\u2019m not sharing this to ask for\
      \ help in figuring out my life.  I\u2019m sharing this because I believe the\

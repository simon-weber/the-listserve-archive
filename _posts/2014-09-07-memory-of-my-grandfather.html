    body: "My grandfather whom I spend my childhood with, passed away more than one\
      \ year ago. Though it is anticipated because of his illness, the pain and sadness\
      \ is worse than I expected, I might have imagine, predict, forecast but when\
      \ the reality comes, it is worse. There is no time you will be ready to lose\
      \ someone that you love and there is no words can describe how heavy the pain\
      \ is.  This whole experience also teaches something new, so heavy sadness can\
      \ paralyze you, literally, it is true. Like I am trying to standing when I come\
      \ in to the room where my late grandfather lied but I cannot because the wave\
      \ of sadness is so big.  Paralyzed. Numb. Weak.I am a true believer that the\
      \ best regret in life is for the things that you didn\u2019t do rather than\
      \ something that we did. My biggest regret with regards to my grandfather departure\
      \ is I don\u2019t spend enough time to know about his childhood, his teenage\
      \ life, his young adult life, his ambitions when he was young, his achievement\
      \ when he was young, what drives him happy when he was a young man; all the\
      \ things that he went through before he is a grey haired man who raised me.\
      \  I have this privileges that he knows me so well, my ambitions, my accomplishments,\
      \ things that make me happy, things that I like but I don\u2019t know those\
      \ things about him.  I am not. I will never know.  I only know him as my grandfather,\
      \ I f I can turn back time, I want to know him as a person, as a man before\
      \ I came to this life, before he became my grandfather.\r\n\r\nHis last question\
      \ to me whether I am happy considering my miserable love life.  He told people\
      \ that the only thing that still keeps him alive is because he wants to assure\
      \ my happiness so I told him before he went comma that I am happy that he doesn\u2019\
      t have anything to worry about, that even though my love live is complicated,\
      \ I am happy in my own way, he doesn\u2019t need to worry about me..\r\n\r\n\
      I considered myself strong enough to deal with my grandfather departure while\
      \ other people expect the worse from me because of my intimacy with him, I don\u2019\
      t cry a lot especially in front of my mother and my grandmother; I work like\
      \ nothing happens, like my grandfather, one of the most important person in\
      \ my life is still here and every weekend, he will wait for me to visit him.\
      \  What they don\u2019t know is the first time I cried out loud after the funeral\
      \ is when I flipped over the photo album and found his picture as a young man\
      \ laughs, he looks very happy as a young man but yet I don\u2019t know that\
      \ part of his life, not even a bit.  The second time is when I found my pictures\

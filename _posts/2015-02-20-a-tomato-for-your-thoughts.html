    body: "When I was 12 years old and entering middle school there was a distinct\
      \ shift from the carefree innocence of elementary school. The girls started\
      \ wearing makeup and straightening their hair. It was then that I realized there\
      \ was one definition of beauty and I was not it. My lips were too thin. My nose\
      \ was too round. My skin had been taken over my pimples. My boobs were nonexistent.\
      \ I was awkward. Not helping my \u201Csituation\u201D was that I had the most\
      \ gorgeous mother. She was the definition of beauty that I strived to be. And\
      \ there was my sister who was only14 months older, yet had developed much earlier\
      \ and seemed to have skipped the awkward phase.\r\n\r\nThis insecurity that\
      \ began while I was in middle school continued throughout high school and by\
      \ the time I reached college this insecurity had grown to affect my interactions\
      \ with people, my focus in school, and my ability to be comfortable being myself...I\
      \ had put my mom on a pedestal and constantly compared myself to my sister and\
      \ the models and actresses airbrushed on magazines. This physical insecurity\
      \ had completely enveloped me and had grown to affect my own self worth- I was\
      \ internally telling myself that I was ugly, unattractive, not smart enough,\
      \ not cool enough, not funny enough, not worthy of friends.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\u2019\
      t until I was 20-21 years old that things started to shift internally. I started\
      \ \u201Cto come into my own\u201D as they say. I met truly wonderful, confident\
      \ and beautiful friends in college who opened me up to acknowledging my own\
      \ self worth. I realized I was more than my external self. My inner dialogue\
      \ which I\u2019ve become even more in touch with recently through my meditation\
      \ practice changed from negative self talk to positive reinforcement, appreciation\
      \ and love for myself.\r\n\r\nI think everyone has dealt with some sort of insecurity\
      \ at some point. What I\u2019ve learned is how important confidence is, our\
      \ internal dialogue, and acceptance. We are all our own worst critic. And that\u2019\
      s by choice. We have the power to change how we think and govern our own thoughts.\
      \ We have the power to be confident, to love ourselves and to be happy. Someone\
      \ once told me that we can choose our thoughts like we choose our tomatoes.\
      \ When we go to the grocery store and we\u2019re selecting which tomatoes we\u2019\
      re going to purchase, we sort through the bin and avoid the discolored or bruised\
      \ ones. We seek to find that perfectly shaped, bright colored tomato. The same\
      \ goes for our thoughts, except we\u2019re less selective\u2026We don\u2019\
      t spend as much time choosing our thoughts. We let the negative thoughts seep\
      \ right in.\r\n\r\nThere will always be external factors affecting what you\
      \ may be dealing with internally. But, only YOU can choose how to interpret\
      \ and react to them. It\u2019s still a learning process for me but let me ask\
      \ you-how do you channel your inner voice? How have you found your confidence\

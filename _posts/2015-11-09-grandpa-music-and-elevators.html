    body: "Hello Listserve,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a 25-ish year old Mechanical Engineer\
      \ in Atlanta.  I\u2019m passionate about my job, but I don\u2019t like to let\

      \ a 3D printer at home, I love math, I\u2019m a bad dresser, and I\u2019m a\
      \ bit of an introvert). I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m no \u201Cspecial snowflake\u201D\
      \ in that regard, but my main passion is music.\r\n\r\nI play with a few bands\
      \ around town on weekends (guitar, fiddle, and stand-up bass).  I\u2019m crazy\
      \ about pre-WWII blues (especially piedmont-style guitar), old-time fiddle tunes,\
      \ ragtime, and early jazz/swing. If I could, I\u2019d love to go hang out in\
      \ the 1920\u2019s for a week or so. Lately I\u2019ve been listening to Lowe\
      \ Stokes, Boswell Sisters, Stuff Smith, Clarence Williams, Bull City Red, Rev.\
      \ Gary Davis, Blind Blake, Charlie Poole, and Mississippi Sheiks (to name a\
      \ few).  I love finding new people to play with and being introduced to old\
      \ songs and styles I\u2019ve never played.  If you\u2019re in the Atlanta area,\

      \n\r\nAre you afraid or cautious of elevators? Are you an elevator mechanic?\r\
      \n\r\nRegardless of the order, if you answered \"yes\" to one question and \"\
      no\" to the other question, you should change your mind. If you only ride them,\

      \ other mode of transportation if you look at it by miles traveled. I would\

      \ multiple redundant safety mechanisms in place to protect passengers, and they\
      \ are waaaaay over-engineered.  For example, the MINIMUM number of suspension\
      \ cables allowed by law in the USA is 3, and each cable is required to support\
      \ 6 to 12 times the weight of whole system by itself.  You can throw away any\
      \ fears you have about those cables snapping and falling to your death.  Even\
      \ if they magically disappeared, there are emergency brakes in place to stop\

      \ work\u201D if you\u2019re mechanically inclined and interested.\r\n\r\nHaving\

      \  If you do a search for \u201Celevator fatalities,\u201D you will find that\
      \ an overwhelming majority of elevator-related accidents involve technicians\
      \ and installers rather than passengers. They\u2019re working with hunks of\
      \ steel moving at high speeds and operating on high voltages suspended high\
      \ above the ground.  It\u2019s a recipe for disaster if one isn\u2019t careful.\r\

      <p>Let&#8217;s talk about Elevators.</p>

      <p>Are you afraid or cautious of elevators? Are you an elevator mechanic?</p>

      <p>Regardless of the order, if you answered "yes" to one question and "no" to

      <p>For passengers, elevators are approximately 10-bajillion times safer than

      <p>Critical mass is the most fun you''ll have on a bike. So what is it? Its
      an informal mass bike ride that happens on the last Friday of every month. In
      Los Angeles, it meets at Wilshire and Western. Its a good idea for riders to
      meet beforehand, but as long as you get your ass to the start point at 730,

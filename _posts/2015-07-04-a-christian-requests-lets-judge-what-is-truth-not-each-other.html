      \ are judging right now, weighing my beliefs against yours. You judge everyone,\

      \ While many judgments are based on external laws, I believe there are absolute\

      \ wrong. Judgment is part of our nature. We cannot function without making judgments.\
      \  We cannot NOT judge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWE CANNOT JUDGE WITH RELATIVE STANDARDS\r\
      \n\r\nLet's  judge for ourselves what is right or wrong, you may say. However,\
      \ if we each have our own \"truths\" and truth is relative, there is no real\
      \ truth. Diametrically opposing beliefs cannot both be true. Consequently, we\
      \ cannot even tell anyone what they \"ought\" to do. Absent a universal standard,\
      \ we cannot measure what is right or wrong.  We couldn't even say  \"She shouldn't\
      \ judge.\" or \"He should be tolerant.\" That would be judging.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
      \nTOLERANCE MEANS RESPECTFUL DISAGREEMENT\r\n\r\nBy definition, tolerance means\
      \  putting up with beliefs with which we don't agree. If you agree with someone,\
      \ tolerance isn't necessary.\r\n\r\nTolerance  also means not forcing others\
      \ to participate in and affirm our own beliefs. \"Don't like gay marriage? Don't\
      \ get gay married.\" Point well taken. \" Do like gay marriage?\" Don't force\
      \ someone against their personal beliefs to directly take part in supporting\
      \ it. Hate speech, lawsuits or fines for someone not willing to participate\
      \ as  a wedding photographer or cater a gay wedding against a morally held belief\
      \ is not tolerance. Should a gay print-shop owner be forced to print material\
      \ teaching against the gay lifestyle?\r\n\r\nThis is distinctly different from\
      \ someone being denied service at a restaurant, etc. Gay people are welcome\
      \ in my life, but I should not be forced to act in violation of deeply held\
      \ moral beliefs, nor should you be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLET'S JUDGE WHAT IS TRUTH,\
      \ NOT EACH OTHER\r\n\r\nDon't judge ME or my RIGHT to what I believe.  I have\

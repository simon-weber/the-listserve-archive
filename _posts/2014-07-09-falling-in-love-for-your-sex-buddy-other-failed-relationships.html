      \r\nI\u2019ve never been able to commit to someone, tell them I liked them,\
      \ and call them when I wanted to.\r\nI fell in love for my sex buddy, never\
      \ told him, got offended when he dated other girls, and then disappeared from\
      \ his life.\r\nI fell in love with a married man, who broke apart his life -\
      \ but never dared to ask him to come back to me.\r\nI never fell in love with\
      \ the men that were in love with me, for some reason.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is the\
      \ secret of love? Why don\u2019t I get it?\r\nI see my friends - I\u2019m 27\

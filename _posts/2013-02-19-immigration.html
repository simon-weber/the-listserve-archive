      \ Maybe I'm bored of my current location? I don't know. Maybe I don't like my\
      \ country? I can't tell you this too. For me it looks like a challenge. You're\
      \ in foreign country, you know nobody, you're pretty scared. You have to speak\
      \ on foreign language. You're nervous all days long for the first time. So does\
      \ it worth it? Please share you stiry with me if you have such experience. \r\

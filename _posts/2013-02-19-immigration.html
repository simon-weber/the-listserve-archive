<p>Let's talk about immigration. To be honest I think about it almost every day. Ok, not every day but this theme appears in my head from time to time. And I really do not know why exactly I want to immigrate to another country. Maybe I'm bored of my current location? I don't know. Maybe I don't like my country? I can't tell you this too. For me it looks like a challenge. You're in foreign country, you know nobody, you're pretty scared. You have to speak on foreign language. You're nervous all days long for the first time. So does it worth it? Please share you stiry with me if you have such experience. </p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

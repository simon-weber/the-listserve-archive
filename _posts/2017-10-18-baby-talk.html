      \ things resolved: we didn\u2019t have our baby last night, though we did spend\
      \ a few hours in the hospital and some more painful hours dealing with intermittent\
      \ pre-labor contractions at home. One doctor had wanted to induce her right\
      \ away, but we managed to avoid that for now. We\u2019re at home now, measuring\
      \ the occasional contraction, making bets as to whether or not our daughter\
      \ will arrive today. One thing I\u2019m pretty confident of: by the time any\
      \ of you read this, I\u2019ll have a newborn.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, we\u2019\
      re ready for this. My wife and I are both real grown-up adults, in our early\
      \ 30s, well-educated. We\u2019ve bought and read easily a dozen books on pregnancy\
      \ and early childhood; we\u2019ve made a detailed checklist of things we need\
      \ to prepare for a child; we\u2019ve dutifully checked off every item. We are\
      \ as ready as it is possible to be for this baby.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand,\
      \ who can be really prepared to begin a commitment which lasts the entire duration\
      \ of the remainder of your life? If getting married was a big deal\u2014and\
      \ it was\u2014there was still at least the theoretical option of an out if things\
      \ didn\u2019t work out between us. There\u2019s no divorcing your child. Of\
      \ course, marriage turned out to be a great decision, and I have no doubt that\
      \ having a baby will turn out the same way.\r\n\r\nStill, there is some angst.\
      \ My job as a freelance programmer pays well when I work, but gives me no stability\
      \ whatsoever. My wife doesn\u2019t have a job to come back to either; she was\
      \ contract-based, and her last one expired a few weeks ago. Her plan is to go\
      \ back to school in the spring semester and hope that a second master\u2019\
      s in a more generalized field will make her more employable than when she had\
      \ a single master\u2019s in a hyper-specialized field. This is all fine when\
      \ you\u2019re a young competitive couple, but can we afford to keep this sort\
      \ of high-risk high-reward career when there\u2019s a kid who depends on us?\
      \ We have to assume so\u2014we do assume so\u2014but now there\u2019s a new\
      \ voice in the back of our minds, and it\u2019s very insistent: Risks Are Bad\
      \ Now. You Have To Keep The Baby Fed.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ll make it work, one way\
      \ or another. In the meantime, we\u2019re just on the hook, waiting for this\
      \ kid. I\u2019m actually a bit peeved that she didn\u2019t keep to schedule.\
      \ I\u2019m aware that only 5% of babies are born on the due date, and as many\
      \ come after as before, so I\u2019m trying to suppress the emotion, but it\u2019\
      s resilient. Even if you ignore my personal desire to play with my child, my\
      \ wife is having a really rough time of it these days, and it seems cruel to\
      \ prolong that. In the meantime, I\u2019m just keeping the midwife\u2019s words\

      <p>"The Listserve" has been impressively void of self promotion, probably due
      to the ban on links. Amongst those in the know, the classic "Diva Cup" post
      stands out as a favorite. Unfortunately, I was unable to find a sponsor for
      this post within the 48 hours I was allotted and I have no Chicken Soup for
      the Soul words of wisdom. I do, however, have some things I think people should
      know: </p>

      <p>* You should brush your teeth before you eat, or wait 30 minutes after (for
      pH reasons)<br />* HBO''s Girls would be better if they cut out all the focus
      grouped portions (i.e. any scene not involving Hannah).<br />* Ashton Kutcher
      is a megadouche who used the issue of sex trafficking to further his career
      <br />* Popchips (and Alison Brod Public Relations) is run by people too dumb
      to realize that dressing a megadouche up in brownface and telling him to fake
      a foreign accent to sell some revolting chips might be deemed offensive. <br
      />* You can make popcorn in the microwave using a paper bag and some popcorn<br
      />* Google George Zimmerman''s MySpace profile and tell me he''s not guilty
      <br />* 15 of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 were Saudi Arabian citizens<br />* I
      need a 1 BR apt in Portland near the Yellow Max line with no carpet and a gas
      stove </p>

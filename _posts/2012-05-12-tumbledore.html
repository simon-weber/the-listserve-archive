<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>"The Listserve" has been impressively void of self promotion, probably due to the ban on links. Amongst those in the know, the classic "Diva Cup" post stands out as a favorite. Unfortunately, I was unable to find a sponsor for this post within the 48 hours I was allotted and I have no Chicken Soup for the Soul words of wisdom. I do, however, have some things I think people should know: </p>
<p>* You should brush your teeth before you eat, or wait 30 minutes after (for pH reasons)<br />* HBO's Girls would be better if they cut out all the focus grouped portions (i.e. any scene not involving Hannah).<br />* Ashton Kutcher is a megadouche who used the issue of sex trafficking to further his career <br />* Popchips (and Alison Brod Public Relations) is run by people too dumb to realize that dressing a megadouche up in brownface and telling him to fake a foreign accent to sell some revolting chips might be deemed offensive. <br />* You can make popcorn in the microwave using a paper bag and some popcorn<br />* Google George Zimmerman's MySpace profile and tell me he's not guilty <br />* 15 of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 were Saudi Arabian citizens<br />* I need a 1 BR apt in Portland near the Yellow Max line with no carpet and a gas stove </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

  body: "...She walked round the block, from her house to ours, after her chemotherapy\
    \ treatment. She didn\u2019t wear her kerchief. The morning was light, airy, and\
    \ blue. Green leaves hung heavily from strong oak branches, and cicadas buzzed\
    \ heavily from within them, hidden. As Maya trudged over the sidewalk, her legs\
    \ began to feel lighter and lighter.\r\n\tHer walk was short, and took all of\
    \ two minutes. By the time she arrived at our yellow house her legs were so light,\
    \ she began to float. She was in the air; only by a few inches, but not at all\
    \ grounded. With purposeful movements she opened the wide, white gate to our backyard\
    \ garden and entered, closing it behind her carefully. She didn\u2019t ring a\
    \ doorbell or knock. No one, besides herself, knew where she was.\r\n\tThe garden\
    \ had been watered that morning, and it was still early. Humid air was trapped\
    \ below the greenery, giving the garden a damp, jungle-like feel.\r\n\tMaya looked\
    \ over the rows of shrubbery, and the assortment of flowers, and took up the nearby\
    \ shovel. She started digging up the pink impatiens, then the large, leafy bleeding\
    \ heart.\r\n\tWe, inside, heard the loud shoveling noise and gathered at the back\
    \ window. Seeing her, we watched with a sense of dread. What was she doing? Under\
    \ some spell, we didn\u2019t think to go out and ask; we stayed in, observing,\
    \ unblinking, chests pounding. Mom called Maya\u2019s mom, told her Maya was up\
    \ to something; that none of us knew what to do.\r\n\tWe watched as Maya shoveled\
    \ with regular strong strokes, carefully piling the dirt to the side of the growing\
    \ hole, which within an hour gaped. Clearly satisfied, visibly tiring, she sat\
    \ in it and began covering herself; all except her hairless head. It stuck up,\
    \ surrounded by dirt, severed flowers, and half-leaves. Then she began to yell.\r\
    \n\t\u201CI need water!\u201D\r\n\tWe heard her from our window perch, and so\
    \ went to the backyard. Arriving at the site, we saw exactly what we had viewed\
    \ from inside: Maya\u2019s face sticking up out of the dirt. Like a flower, but\
    \ pale, and plain, and beckoning. I grasped the handle of a watering can.\r\n\t\
    \u201CWater me!,\u201D she cried.\r\n\tThe water from the hose was cold. I ran\
    \ some into the can, and then positioned it over her head.\r\n\t\u201CYes!,\u201D\
    \ she said.\r\n\tWe all took turns watering Maya\u2019s head, and she made clownish\
    \ faces as the water flowed downwards, over her eyes which blinked and opened\
    \ wide repetitively, over her mouth which spurted and smiled; over her pale, vein-lined\
    \ scalp.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnonymous\r\nlistserve.address5@gmail.com\r\nNew York\r\n\r\

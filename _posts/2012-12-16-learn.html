<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that I know a lot more than everybody else; it&#8217;s that I want to know more.&#8221;</p>
<p>A very wise woman said these words to me, and I have breathed them in ever since.</p>
<p>If you have that desire&#8212;that spark&#8212;to dedicate a minute, an hour, a day, or your life to learning, amazing things can and will change. This doesn&#8217;t mean sitting in a classroom and listening to lectures, this means immersing yourself in new situations, new places, new conversations, and new perspectives.</p>
<p>I plan to live with this mindset for the rest of my life. The smallest changes in my daily routine teach me so much; I have learned from these experiences and learned to take bigger, and bigger risks.</p>
<p>Listen to This American Life, eat a chocolate mousse cake for a snack, be a Buddhist for a day, move to Indonesia, backpack, read The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime over and over again, laugh too often, cry even more, smile, befriend a stranger, embarrass yourself, swap music with a friend, speak Mandarin, compliment somebody for no reason, learn.</p>
<p>Share this mindset. And share it with me. Tell me your stories, how to learn, who to learn from, what to learn, and what I can teach others.</p>
<p>In the wise words of the very same woman, &#8220;Sharing is the second hardest thing in life, the first is finding people to share with.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>

      <p>I have 3 orders of business that I have been waiting forever to send out
      to the listserve.</p>

      <p>1) Help me find my sister: In 2004, my dad passed away suddenly and while
      sorting through old copies of his will, we found out that we have a sister named
      Sarah (or Sara, I cannot remember the spelling). My mom knows very little as
      this happened before they met. I realize this is a long shot, but I''m going
      to take it! Here''s what I know:</p>

      <p>---- Her name is Sara(h), her mother was from either Finland, Sweden, or
      Norway and returned there when she was pregnant. Norway seems to stick out in
      my mom''s mind. My dad was Filipino so she would be a beautiful mix of those
      2. She''s born anywhere from 1977-1980. They either met in Hawaii, Minnesota,
      or Chicago.</p>

      <p>Any leads? Please send info to dionisiolistserve@gmail.com<br />(Dionisio
      is my last name if that helps)</p>

      <p>2) For about 5-6 years, I have traveled the world and asked people one question:
      What is love to you? I have not decided what to do so far with the responses
      I have received thus far, but am hoping to get a big enough database to either
      start some sort of website (like PostSecret which is fabulous) or a listserv
      of sorts. So, I ask you listserve, what is love to you? </p>

      <p>3) PSA: Please never ever, ever, ever, EVER shake a baby! It seems common
      sense, but happens more often than you think. When frustrated, put the baby
      down in a safe place and walk away.</p>

      <p><br />Hug more, love more, everyone! Hope to hear from you all soon :)</p>

      \ \u2013 Andrew Harvey\r\n\r\nAs an almost-20 year old, I feel like it isn't\
      \ my place to offer others advice. (Except, maybe, to someone under 20 years\
      \ old, in which case, two things: First, take education very seriously, not\
      \ because it will make you wealthy or prominent, but because it will immensely\
      \ enrich your life. Second, it is very hard to avoid becoming very much like\
      \ one or both of your parents when you grow up. This isn't a piece of advice\
      \ but rather an observation.)\r\n\r\nAnyways, I was recently thinking about\
      \ getting a tattoo of the phrase, \"This too shall pass,\" in Hebrew. (I recommend\
      \ reading the Wikipedia page about this phrase, as it provides some intriguing\
      \ insight and history.) My best friend texted me some advice, which included\
      \ the following sentence: \"I think you are the type of person who can tell\
      \ others what in your life has meaning without it being on your body.\" It was\
      \ incredibly thought-provoking, and I realized she was right.\r\n\r\nI suppose\
      \ this is my chance to do so, seeing as this email is all I have to show you\
      \ all what in my life has meaning. Because I don\u2019t think I should be offering\
      \ advice, and because my best friend\u2019s words have had such a profound effect\
      \ on me, I hope it won't be too conceited or boring to mention what has made\
      \ my life good: staying perpetually curious and fascinated.\r\n\r\nI have learned\
      \ as much from an astronomy course taught by Alex Filippenko (Google him!) as\
      \ I have from a class on English literature from 1300-1650, or from my 13-month-old\
      \ niece\u2019s laughter, or from travelling all over Europe, or from reading\
      \ Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s Wikipedia page. I think it is nice to be reminded\
      \ that our lives and our selves are very teeny tiny parts of the vast world\
      \ (not to mention the universe!). There\u2019s a lot to see, hear, read, and\
      \ encounter out there; some of it might be momentarily interesting and then\
      \ get lost somewhere in the depths of your memory, and some of it might be so\
      \ incredibly powerful and overwhelming that it will stay with you forever. Here\
      \ are a few things that have fallen in the latter category for me, and I hope\
      \ they will for you, as well: J.D. Salinger\u2019s Franny and Zooey, Zora Neale\
      \ Hurston\u2019s Their Eyes Were Watching God, Death Cab for Cutie\u2019s \u201C\
      St. Peter\u2019s Cathedral,\u201D the word \u201Cephemeral,\u201D and the city\
      \ of Berkeley, California.\r\n\r\n(If you\u2019re a fellow UC Berkeley student,\
      \ and you\u2019ve read this far, let\u2019s be friends! \u201CSometimes life\
      \ is merely a matter of coffee and whatever intimacy a cup of coffee affords.\u201D\
      \ - Richard Brautigan)\r\n\r\nThere are three things I would like to do before\
      \ my time here (in this world, not in this email) is up: be a loving and happy\
      \ wife and mother (and grandmother and great-grandmother\u2026), write something\
      \ (be it an essay, a poem, a bunch of poems, a short story, a bunch of short\
      \ stories, or a novel) (or a mix of all of those) that stirs people\u2019s souls,\
      \ and get appointed to the United States Supreme Court (it\u2019s a pipe dream,\
      \ but that\u2019s okay).\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, I still have a lot to learn.\

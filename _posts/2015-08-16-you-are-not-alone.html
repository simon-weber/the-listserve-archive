      <p>Who is this:<br />I&#8217;m an Egyptian who learned English while living
      in Japan. I&#8217;m currently living in Toronto, Canada after being kicked out
      of New York City.</p>

      <p>I didn&#8217;t get kicked out for cool reasons - like running an underground
      dumpling operation, or something. It mostly had to do with paperwork, and timelines.
      However - getting &#8220;kicked out&#8221; has been the best thing to happen
      to me so far.</p>

      <p>Introspection:<br />I''m 25 years old. I&#8217;ve had a good life by definition.
      I have a family that loves me. I got to live in different countries. I got to
      be part of a failed startup. I am now with a successful startup. I&#8217;ve
      got a great group of friends (who I should be better to). And I have so many
      opportunities.</p>

      <p>So why do I doubt myself? Why am I constantly fluctuating between thinking
      I&#8217;ve got everything figured out, and I&#8217;ve got nothing figured out?
      Purpose? Value? One of my best friends described this as just being in your
      20s. I don&#8217;t know if it will stop - and to be honest I don&#8217;t know
      if I want it to stop. It&#8217;s tedious, it keeps me up at night - but It feels
      human.</p>

      <p>Dealing with bad situations:<br />I have a tendency to smile when I talk
      about bad things that have happened to me. I''m not sure why, but maybe this
      explains it:</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m not owed anything. I was born naked into this world. When something
      "bad" happens to me - I don''t think it''s an inherently bad, or malicious thing.
      It is just a thing that has happened that has resulted in me being sad/upset.
      So the adversary that I''m fighting isn''t this external cause which I have
      little-to-no control over. Instead it''s about how I handle my emotions, and
      my response to this circumstance - which is completely within my control. I
      may not always get the result I want - but, hey, I wasn''t owed it to begin
      with. :)</p>

      <p>Questions:<br /> - People older than 25 - what&#8217;s one thing that you&#8217;ve
      come to learn that you would tell someone in their mid-20s that you don''t think
      they''d know, but should just trust you on. Not that younger people don&#8217;t
      have any wisdom to impart - but I do believe some things are learned by time
      alone.</p>

      <p> - To everyone on the list: Where do you live? If you love it, why should
      I live there? If you hate it, why should I not live there?</p>

      <p>Fun things:<br />Favourite website ever: whosampled[dot]com. Discover music
      through samples, covers, and remixes.</p>

      <p>I love getting glimpses into complete stranger&#8217;s lives (in a non-creepy

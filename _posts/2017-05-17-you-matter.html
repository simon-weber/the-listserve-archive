      <p>I''ve been a subscriber for years, since I was thirteen, and like every subscriber
      I''ve wondered what I would say when I had the chance. Now my chance has come,
      and I flat out balked. I''m actually pretty terrified because what if I do it
      wrong? But, as the cliche goes, it''s better to do anything than nothing at
      all.<br />So here it goes.<br />I want to tell you all that you matter. Everything
      you do, no matter how small, matters. No pressure. It''s true! This may come
      across as a little cheesy, but bear with me. Earlier today my mom and I were
      having a heart to heart about our life, and she told me that the reason we are
      where we are today is because nine years ago when I was nine years old, I came
      back from a horse riding lesson (background~ my mom was a competitive dressage
      rider and teacher, and I have been riding and competing since I was two) and
      said to her that I didn''t want to ride that way anymore. I wanted to find a
      different way. Years later, my mom now has her own leadership through natural
      horsemanship company. And I forgot I said that. It didn''t mean anything to
      me at the time, it just drifted out there, but to her it changed everything.
      This is just what made me think about this. It made me remember when I got a
      hug that I really needed and I didn''t have to ask, or when the stranger next
      to me on an airplane put subtitles on her movie so I could watch too, or a dear
      friend saying "someone is going to be so lucky to fall in love with you one
      day". Never underestimate these moments in life. Never underestimate what you
      can affect when you''re not even trying.</p>

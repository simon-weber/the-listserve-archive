<p>I was told a while ago that I should write a book about networking&#8230;it was a joke. However, if you&#8217;d like some random social advice from a UNC-Chapel Hill senior, here ya go:</p>
<p>1)   Never be shy introducing yourself. Anytime you approach someone, whether at work or a bar, it&#8217;s a compliment to them.</p>
<p>     a.    People love to be approached for networking. Just by being interested you&#8217;re telling them that you see them as an expert in their field and you&#8217;d like to be where they are. I&#8217;ve never had anyone be less than thrilled when I asked them about their experiences.</p>
<p>     b.    Ex. I met the Partner and CCO at my advertising agency internship recently who everyone thought was intimidating. He&#8217;s actually extremely open, easy to get along with and full of advice.</p>
<p>Resulting from things that irk me:</p>
<p>2)   If a girl is in a bar, she wants to be approached. Doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;ll be the one to get her number or take her home, but don&#8217;t be afraid to introduce yourself.</p>
<p>     a.    Guys may have a fear of rejection, but we came out that night in our 5-inch heels to talk to someone.</p>
<p>     b.    Hint: it might be scary to approach a pack of girls, but we&#8217;re in the pack because we&#8217;re just as nervous to approach you. The pack is safe, but we&#8217;d rather break away.</p>
<p>                                     i.     It&#8217;s depressing when you catch a guy&#8217;s eye and he smiles, but then never gets the courage to come up to you.</p>
<p>3)   Know when to leave</p>
<p>     a.    I recently had a guy follow me around a bar even after separating twice. He was nice at first, but when a girl tells you she has to find her friends, she isn&#8217;t asking for help.</p>
<p>4)   Don&#8217;t become the &#8220;corner creeper.&#8221;</p>
<p>     a.    It&#8217;s surprising how many guys will literally stare a girl down like it&#8217;s a pickup line. I wonder if that works on someone&#8230;</p>
<p>5)   I&#8217;ll give you the best opening line that works on me: &#8220;Hi, I&#8217;m Tyler. *smiles*.&#8221;</p>
<p><br />A note to McLovett&#8230;</p>
<p>Stop hating winter. I know it&#8217;s freezing and dreary up there in Connecticut, and the days are shorter and darker, but it&#8217;s the best time of the year. There&#8217;s a calm about winter, when the air smells like burning wood and everything sparkles from the crystals on the trees. My favorite memories are from NY, sitting around a bon fire in snow with hot chocolate and family. Just enjoy the weather next to a fire with your favorite strawberry frosted mini wheats, and realize how much better summer is because you have to put up with winter. Don&#8217;t be a Negative Nancy. Winter is wonderful.</p>

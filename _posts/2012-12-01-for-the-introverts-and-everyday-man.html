      was a joke. However, if you&#8217;d like some random social advice from a UNC-Chapel
      Hill senior, here ya go:</p>

      <p>1)   Never be shy introducing yourself. Anytime you approach someone, whether
      at work or a bar, it&#8217;s a compliment to them.</p>

      <p>     a.    People love to be approached for networking. Just by being interested
      you&#8217;re telling them that you see them as an expert in their field and
      you&#8217;d like to be where they are. I&#8217;ve never had anyone be less than
      thrilled when I asked them about their experiences.</p>

      <p>     b.    Ex. I met the Partner and CCO at my advertising agency internship
      recently who everyone thought was intimidating. He&#8217;s actually extremely
      open, easy to get along with and full of advice.</p>

      <p>Resulting from things that irk me:</p>

      <p>2)   If a girl is in a bar, she wants to be approached. Doesn&#8217;t mean
      you&#8217;ll be the one to get her number or take her home, but don&#8217;t
      be afraid to introduce yourself.</p>

      <p>     a.    Guys may have a fear of rejection, but we came out that night
      in our 5-inch heels to talk to someone.</p>

      <p>     b.    Hint: it might be scary to approach a pack of girls, but we&#8217;re
      in the pack because we&#8217;re just as nervous to approach you. The pack is
      safe, but we&#8217;d rather break away.</p>

      catch a guy&#8217;s eye and he smiles, but then never gets the courage to come
      up to you.</p>

      <p>3)   Know when to leave</p>

      <p>     a.    I recently had a guy follow me around a bar even after separating
      twice. He was nice at first, but when a girl tells you she has to find her friends,
      she isn&#8217;t asking for help.</p>

      down like it&#8217;s a pickup line. I wonder if that works on someone&#8230;</p>

      I&#8217;m Tyler. *smiles*.&#8221;</p>

      <p><br />A note to McLovett&#8230;</p>

<p>Hello everyone !</p>
<p>My name is Steven Page, and I live in Montreal, most precisely in the Verdun area. You may be interested in Free Shit Verdun, which is something that me, my friend (Hi, Ludauvick) and my girlfriend (Hi, Catherine) started just about a year ago.</p>
<p><br />The concept is simple : We give free shit in Verdun.</p>
<p>We have a free library 24/7 in front of our apartment where people can take books and also give some. From time to time, we give some free stuff with a huge &#8220;FREE&#8221; panel. It makes people happy, and our neighbours love it.</p>
<p>Tomorrow (Thurday the 6th), we will be doing a &#8220;Cin&#233; Free&#8221; event, which is basically a movie that we screen in front of our apartment, near the street. People bring beer and popcorn, we vote for a movie and we chill all night. If you are in the Montreal area, you can come over if you want !</p>
<p>Just type Free Shit Verdun in Facebook and you&#8217;ll get all you need to know.</p>
<p>AND NOW, SOME FREE INSPIRATIONAL SHIT :</p>
<p>Here are some of my favorite quotes &#8220;An extraterrestrial being, newly arrived on Earth - scrutinizing what we mainly present to our children in television, radio, movies, newspapers, magazines, the comics, and many books - might easily conclude that we are intent on teaching them murder, rape, cruelty, superstition, credulity, and consumerism. We keep at it, and through constant repetition many of them finally get it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In science it often happens that scientists say, "You know that's a really good argument; my position is mistaken," and then they would actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again. They really do it. It doesn't happen as often as it should, because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful. But it happens every day. I cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or religion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You're an interesting species. An interesting mix. You're capable of such beautiful dreams, and such horrible nightmares. You feel so lost, so cut off, so alone, only you're not. See, in all our searching, the only thing we've found that makes the emptiness bearable, is each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Frederick Douglas taught that literacy is the path from slavery to freedom. There are many kinds of slavery and many kinds of freedom, but reading is still the path.&#8221;</p>
<p><br /> ALSO, BE AWARE OF THIS : Legal counterfeiting of a national currency for private gains.</p>
<p><br />AND FINALLY : I&#8217;d just like to take some time to salute someone very important to me. Cath, c&#8217;&#233;tait ta f&#234;te le 31 et je crois que c&#8217;est encore temps de te faire une petite surprise. En fait, tous les jours de l&#8217;ann&#233;e peuvent &#234;tre bons pour &#231;a :) Alors voil&#224;, je ne t&#8217;avais pas dit que j&#8217;avais gagn&#233; le listserve. Cette fois, c&#8217;est pas un troll, j&#8217;ai gagn&#233; pour de vrai. Tu as le visage d&#8217;un ange du moment o&#249; tu te l&#232;ves le matin jusqu&#8217;au moment o&#249; tu te couches le soir, et tout &#231;a sans avoir &#224; mettre de d&#233;guisement sur ton visage. Je t&#8217;aime comme &#231;a. Tu es une des seules personnes avec qui je peux d&#233;compresser. Merci d&#8217;&#234;tre chill.</p>
<p>GOOD DAY TO EVERYONE !!!!!! :)</p>

<p>Simple rules to live by:<br />1. Tell the Truth  <br />2. Be optimistic - You'll live longer, be happier and potentially make more. If you're not optimistic fake it 'till you are.<br />3. (Generally) Don't make assumptions </p>
<p>For 2 years now I've been a single parent. Nothing has shaped me more than learning to parent alone. The first year was grueling as learning to be mr. mom was never part of my life plan. I kept at it and in time, found peace and a deeper connection with my daughter as a result of the work I put in. </p>
<p>Simple parenting rules that have helped me:<br />1. Play is a powerful tool. Learn to play with your kids and use it to teach them lessons.<br />2. Kids f'in love choices. Give them an option a or option b vs. do a now!</p>

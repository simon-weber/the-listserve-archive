      \ I come from the bleak era of Standardized Testing, but I always enjoyed (or\

      s a story of reckless bravery and adventure. It\u2019s a story of family. It\u2019\
      s a story about the power of nature. Or maybe it\u2019s just about the power\
      \ of cookies.\r\n\r\nMost of my dad\u2019s family lives scattered throughout\
      \ California. Around my dad\u2019s birthday in June, we all went on a camping\
      \ trip to the Pinnacles. My parents (wisely) brought an RV, the rest of the\
      \ adults slept in a giant tent, and the four cousins slept in the back of a\
      \ truck. We heard rustling all night, but thought nothing of it.\r\n\r\nIn the\
      \ morning we went on a grueling hike. We brought enough snacks, but not nearly\
      \ enough water. California gets pretty hot and dry in June, but apparently all\
      \ of us native Californians had forgotten this particular climate fact. My dad\
      \ saved the day by taking the empty water bottles, hiking down to the bottom\
      \ to fill them up, and rescuing my dehydrated family members.\r\n\r\nAs if that\
      \ weren't enough excitement for one day, when we got back to the campsite and\
      \ had made dinner, we started hearing more rustling over by the food storage.\
      \ Thinking it was probably a raccoon or something, my aunts, parents, and grandparents\
      \ go over to investigate. Naturally, the kids follow. It\u2019s not a raccoon.\
      \ It has tusks and is GIANT. It\u2019s a wild boar. And there\u2019s another\
      \ one. And it\u2019s eating our garlic bread!\r\n\r\nMy biologist grandpa starts\
      \ clapping and making a bunch of noise, but the boar doesn\u2019t seem to notice\
      \ and keeps chomping away. Foldable metal chairs are brandished, flashlights\
      \ are turned on, someone even thinks to snap a photo of the lunacy. But it\u2019\
      s not until the boars go for the cookies that my aunt goes for the boars. Wielding\
      \ a folding chair, she snatches the cookies, and the boars, apparently satisfied,\
      \ saunter off.\r\n\r\nI hear that the wild boars have been exterminated from\

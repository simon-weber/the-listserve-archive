<p>I'm so not ready for this. I'm going to try to just be as honest and in the moment as possible.  This is a first-take sorta thing kids and kid-ettes, so buckle up and try to bear with me :)</p>
<p>I don't know if any of you have heard about Harsha Maddula these past weeks, but if you Google his name the story you will find is a heartbreaking one.  He and his family have not been off my mind for over a week.  His family wants answers.  I just want them to not feel pain anymore... </p>
<p>I wrote the words above ^^^ yesterday, and then completely blanked.  My mind was muddled mush.  I came back to writing this today after music cleared my mind.  I was able to jam with some friends of mine and the whole process from beginning to end sort of reset me.</p>
<p>So here it is:</p>
<p>Find something in your life that allows you to return to being you, so that you can face the world clear-headed.  I had no idea i should have even been looking when i found music. What helps you/what have you found?</p>

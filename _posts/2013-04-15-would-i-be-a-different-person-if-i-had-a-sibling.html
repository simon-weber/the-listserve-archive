<p>I won The ListServe Lottery, not on April Fool&#8217;s Day, but on National Sibling Day, as an only child.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in China, a country known for a lot of things, including the &#8220;one child policy.&#8221; More than half of the people started to ask about the &#8220;one child policy&#8221; right after they knew I was born in China.</p>
<p>Do you guys still have that policy?</p>
<p>Why did your country have that policy?</p>
<p>Does China really have a large population? How large is it?</p>
<p>But I heard that people still had more than one child, right?</p>
<p>Blah blah blah.</p>
<p>Yes, we did have that policy, because we did have and still have a large population. It&#8217;s very large.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s 1/5 of the world&#8217;s population.</p>
<p>Right now if two only child get married, they could have two kids.</p>
<p>Just two.</p>
<p>No more than two.</p>
<p>However, what I want to talk about today, isn&#8217;t that policy, but a question that has been lingering in my head &#8212; how different would I be, if I had a sibling or two?</p>
<p>Recently at work, we interviewed a lot of people for a project. A young women in her late twenties said that her little sister, who&#8217;s now nine-year-old, is like her baby before she has her own baby. She would tell her all the lessons that she&#8217;d learned in life to prevent her from making the same mistakes. And her biggest wish is for her little sister to grow into a happy and healthy young lady.</p>
<p>I was so moved. I never had that kind of feeling. I never loved anyone in this world unselfishly and unconditionally other than my mom and dad.</p>
<p>I never had a big sister who could have warned me not to fall for Mr. Wrong;</p>
<p>I never had a big brother who could have taught me how to pitch, how to dance, and how to explore the world;</p>
<p>I never had a little sister with whom I could have shared every little secret and every pretty dress;</p>
<p>I never had a little brother whom I&#8217;d call dumb and obnoxious all day long but be secretly proud of.</p>
<p>A &#8220;mean&#8221; friend of mine always says that because I&#8217;m the only child, I&#8217;m spoiled. I&#8217;m eager to win and I always want everything.</p>
<p>But I disagree. Because I was given everything growing up, I cannot care less about monetary things and thus find myself less competitive in a lot of situations.</p>
<p>I cannot prove he&#8217;s wrong, nor prove I&#8217;m right.</p>
<p>If I had a sibling&#8230;</p>
<p>Would I be tougher? Would I be stronger? Would I be kinder?</p>
<p>Would I be more considerate? Would I be more patient? Would I be more mature?</p>
<p>How would they shape me and help me become someone different and better?</p>
<p>I now live a Pacific away from my parents. If I had a sibling, would him or her move here to be closer to me? Would we be each other&#8217;s support?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know. And I will never know.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like, I&#8217;ve never had a true adventure so I&#8217;m ready to take a true adventure;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like, I&#8217;ve never fallen onto the cold, hard ground so I&#8217;m ready to take the biggest chance.</p>
<p>I could never go back in time and grow up once again with a sibling.</p>
<p>Don't be greedy with your love for your siblings, coz there are people longing to have one.</p>

    \ clearly explain why the reader should take action and what effect their action\

    <p>I used to write email for a living for progressive political causes, so I thought
    I''d take this opportunity to share what I''ve learned about writing emails to
    large numbers of people. Perhaps these tips will serve you well when you win the
    Listserve lottery or whenever you find yourself needing to send a clear, compelling
    email to many people at once.</p>

    <p>First, have a clear ask. Don''t bury the story -- effective emails ask the

    what they should do as quickly as possible. If you''ve typed more than a sentence
    or two and haven''t gotten to your ask, revise your draft and see if you can get
    it in earlier. And try to have only one ask per email. If you want your readers
    to do more than one unrelated thing, send them more than one email.</p>

    <p>Second, use direct, conversational language, and keep it short. Your email
    isn''t a term paper or a novel or a text message. A casual tone, clear wording,
    and an eye for brevity will quickly communicate to your readers what you want
    them to do. Save the long explanations, detailed asides, and endless adjectives
    for another time.</p>

    <p>Third, tell a story and be authentic. There is a saying that you should write

    way, so people are moved to take whatever action you''re asking of them. Your
    story should be real and heartfelt, should clearly explain why the reader should

    everyone. I read these emails to look for new trends, get ideas, and scope out

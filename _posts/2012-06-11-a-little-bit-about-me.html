<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am going to have to write this quickly because I am really busy! My flatmate and I are organising a Eurovision party and people will be arriving any minute. Check out wikipedia if you don't know what that is.</p>
<p>My name is James and I am English. I live in Barcelona which I love. Some people say I'm lucky to live here but anyone can do it if they want, it just takes determination and a little bit of sacrifice.</p>
<p>I've not had a Eurovision party before but I think it will be fun, if a little camp! I recently moved into a new flat and have done a lot of work to make it a home. It's nice to be able to enjoy it with my friends.</p>
<p>I'm feeling very happy at the moment. Maybe partly because the weather is good and I can spend time on the beach. Work is going well and I am getting on well with my friends. I certainly didn't feel so happy during the winter, but then it always makes me a bit depressed.</p>
<p>The only downside is I find it harder to eat well and have put on a couple of pounds. It is definitely worth the sacrifice!</p>
<p>I guess the only thing missing is "that special someone", I hope I'll meet them soon. Maybe I already have.</p>
<p><br />Take care, <br />James x <br />Saturday 26 May 2011 <br />Barcelona, Spain</p>

<p>Currently at Lollapalooza in Chicago, so forgive my brevity. Surrounded by festival-goers of all kinds and covered in mud from the the rain. However, the song everyone knew the best was "tonight" by fun. Seems like everyone, including me, is trying to reclaim, or claim, or invent, their wild youth. I hope we all succeed. </p>

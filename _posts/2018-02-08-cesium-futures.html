      <p>CESIUM FUTURES</p>

      <p>Now you may be wondering what exactly this cesium thing is and why to buy
      futures. If you look at the periodic table, it''s on the lower left side, sorta.
      How can this guy give us back our money if we give him this loan? Let me assuage
      your worries. Do I have some sort of insider trading knowledge? None at all!
      Do I work with the element and have special knowledge of its properties in a
      way that could be commercialized? Honestly, I probably haven''t stepped within
      100 around a molecule of the substance in my lifetime.</p>

      <p>Apparently, cesium blows up if my recollection serves well (in all general
      regards, it does. I served as a witness to a neighborhood drug store robbery
      in which the felon was convicted, as clearly stated on my LinkedIn profile).
      Around the same time in school, my friends and I were talking about getting
      into the Des Moines, Iowa real estate market (which has since gone thermonuclear
      hot!) and never acted. While I''ll never forgive myself for that mistake; two
      wrongs don''t make a right. I''m pushing my chips into the middle with this

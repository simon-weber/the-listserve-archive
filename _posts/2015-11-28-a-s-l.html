      \ maps)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBack in April 2009, I spent an evening procrastinating.\
      \ My best friend Rona suggested I try Omegle, which at the time, was a simple\
      \ video-less messenger website for strangers to talk to each other. Conversations\
      \ were assigned randomly. One conversation started, not with demands of \u201C\
      A/S/L?\u201D, or even what I was wearing but with a fairly normal interaction.\
      \ I was studying film at university; he was working on some independent films\
      \ in LA, where he lived. \"Wow\", I thought - \"He might be a great contact\
      \ to have!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBack then, the Omegle website was temperamental\
      \ and conversations used to be cut off all the time. I often wonder what would\
      \ have happened if we had been cut off before we had the chance to exchange\
      \ our full names. Perhaps there is a parallel universe in which this happened\
      \ \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t even recall this now as a significant event, and my\
      \ life would have taken many different turns instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe then\
      \ proceeded to talk for a minimum 4 hours a day. It just felt so easy. I deliberately\
      \ didn't tell anyone at first- I didn't want to overreact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\
      \ had to go away to a place with hardly any Internet connection for a week,\
      \ two weeks after we met. I laid on the hotel bed and felt physically sick because\
      \ I missed him so much. I also felt confused- how could I miss someone I had\
      \ never met?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGradually, we told people about the other. Reactions\
      \ varied, but my best friend Karen told me to go for it. My parents got used\
      \ to me sitting talking to this boy on the other side of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\
      \n\r\nNearly 3 months after we met, I flew over to LA for 2 weeks. I remember\
      \ when I was sitting on the plane, thinking \u201CWHAT AM I DOING?!\u201D\r\n\
      \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we first hugged, he was shaking.\r\n\r\nFirst week was a little\

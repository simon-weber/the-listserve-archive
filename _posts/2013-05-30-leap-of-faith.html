<p>I have moved countries to be with the person I love. To be specific, I moved from a small town in Germany, away from a great job and a great apartment, to the beautiful land of New Zealand.</p>
<p>Ten years have passed and it wasn't always easy. There are still moments where I very much miss my loving family and my german friends, but looking at me now and then-how much have I grown personally and professionally! It was the best decision of my life!</p>
<p>What I am trying to say is, sometimes in life it is important to take a leap of faith. I know it is scary, overwhelming (and exciting) but don't hold yourself back from venturing into life. Live your life to the fullest. Sometimes it takes a leap of faith to really start up your life.</p>
<p>(The person who I met 10 years ago at 2 Kingsley Street in Auckland is now my husband, my best friend and the love of my life who has brought out the best in me. The past ten years have been the best years of my life&#8230;may there be many more to come x)</p>

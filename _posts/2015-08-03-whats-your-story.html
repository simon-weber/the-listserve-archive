      \ to us when a client successfully mobilizes thousands or tens of thousands\
      \ of advocates to stand up for something, and they win their issue. It shows\
      \ the power that people have in our (American) democracy.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite\
      \ stories comes from a campaign led by one of our clients, the American Heart\
      \ Association (AHA). The New York branch, and advocate across the state, had\
      \ struggled for the past 15 years to get lawmakers in New York State to pass\
      \ legislation that would provide CPR training for high school students.\r\n\r\
      \nLast year, they decided to change their strategy. Instead of focusing the\
      \ New York campaign\u2019s messaging on the large numbers of people affected\
      \ by cardiac issues \u2014 like the hundreds of thousands of people that die\
      \ each year to sudden cardiac arrest \u2014 they focused on the stories of a\
      \ handful of courageous parents who had experienced painful personal losses\
      \ of love ones to sudden cardiac arrest. They channeled these parents\u2019\
      \ losses into strength by featuring their stories front and center on the campaign.\
      \ The parents lent their stories, the photos of their children, and their voices\
      \ to a campaign that instantly resonated with people.\r\n\r\nAHA deployed several\
      \ tools through our software platform and made it very easy for their advocates\
      \ statewide to connect with lawmakers, and with the Governor, to voice support\
      \ for policy change. Finally, after 15 years, the New York legislature passed\
      \ the bill in last year\u2019s session. Governor Cuomo later signed the bill.\r\
      \n\r\nStories have a compelling effect on the brain; they draw people in, and\
      \ they let them connect. According to Neuroscientist Uri Hasson, stories actually\
      \ make two people\u2019s brains synchronize.\r\n\r\nI had a professor in business\
      \ school, Craig Wortmann, who was an entrepreneur before he started teaching\
      \ (would be) entrepreneurs. He wrote a book called \u201CWhat\u2019s Your Story\u201D\
      \ and encouraged everyone in the class to sit down and assemble their own stories\
      \ in a story matrix. The idea is that you can draw on stories in different life\
      \ situations and use them to connect with people, in both personal and professional\
      \ situations. Having stories at the ready makes you a  more effective communicator.\

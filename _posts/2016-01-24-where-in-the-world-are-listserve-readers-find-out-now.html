      \nEver wonder who else is reading these Listserve emails? Find out now! Here\u2019\
      s a quick survey (only asking your age and location):\r\nbit[dot]ly/Listserve\r\
      \nOnce you\u2019re done, you\u2019ll be able to see the results, and find out\
      \ where in the world the other Listserve readers are! If you\u2019d prefer a\
      \ clickable link, send me an email.\r\n\r\n***Opportunity***\r\nI\u2019m part\
      \ of the PhET Interactive Simulations project (search for \u201CPhET Simulations\u201D\
      ). If you teach, learn, are a kid, know a kid, or were ever a kid, I\u2019m\
      \ guessing you will find a simulation on our site that will become your new\
      \ favorite thing. They\u2019re all free, and available in your favorite language\
      \ (I swear!).\r\nWe\u2019ve recently started a new collaborative effort to make\
      \ the simulations more accessible for people with disabilities. Right now they\u2019\
      re highly interactive, dynamic, and visual. Which is great! But what if your\
      \ vision isn\u2019t so great and you use a screen reader to navigate webpages,\
      \ or using a mouse is difficult for you and you\u2019re much handier with a\
      \ keyboard or switch device. Or what if it\u2019s helpful for you to have onscreen\
      \ labels read out loud, or it\u2019s much easier for you to learn when dynamic\
      \ representations move a little more slowly. Shouldn\u2019t everyone have access\
      \ to fun, free, effective, science learning resources? And shouldn\u2019t these\
      \ resources be usable by everyone? I think so, and I\u2019m not alone (thank\
      \ goodness!).\r\nSo, here\u2019s the opportunity:\r\n**If you\u2019re really\
      \ into accessible technology, love math and science, and enjoy tackling crazy\
      \ hard tech and design challenges with a great team \u2013 send me an email.\
      \ We may have a job for you, and if not, there are other ways you can get involved!\r\
      \n**If you are a teacher of students with disabilities, a parent of a child\
      \ with a disability, or are a person with a disability, and this project sounds\
      \ interesting to you, send me an email \u2013 we\u2019d love to have your ideas,\
      \ and feedback!\r\n\r\n***True Story***\r\nThe last year has been\u2026bizarre.\
      \ 10 months trying to get pregnant. Then I had a miscarriage. (Sad) Then, a\
      \ weird feeling in my right leg got even weirder, and spread to the entire right\
      \ side of my body. Emergency room. Diagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis. (Surprise!).\
      \ Friends got pregnant \u2013 and I got a degenerative neurological disease.\
      \ Happy for them, sad for me. Actually, mostly I was just sad. I had the experience\
      \ of watching my husband mourn \u2013 for me. That was hard, and sad. Got a\
      \ therapy cat, Annabelle! Sweetest cat ever! Then, two weeks in Lisbon, Portugal\
      \ to learn to be myself again, post-diagnosis. Lisbon is wonderful! Travel always\
      \ helps me when I\u2019m sad (I\u2019ve got to remember this!). Then, I turned\
      \ 32! And found out I\u2019m pregnant again, 9 weeks along now, and begging\
      \ any god, goddess, spirit, or whatever may or may not be out there for a healthy\
      \ baby.\r\nIf you share any of these experiences, and would like to chat about\
      \ it, send me an email! (Quick Tip: To help avoid getting multiple sclerosis,\
      \ get some sunshine and take Vit. D, seriously.)\r\n\r\nBonus Material:\r\n\
      -- Music: Gallant x Sufjan Stevens \u201CBlue Bucket of Gold\u201D on Youtube;\
      \ and Regina Spector\r\n-- Gaming: NeanderthalGamingTV, especially for Super\
      \ Smash Bros (YouTube, Twitch) \u2013 Shout out to my talented brother!\r\n\

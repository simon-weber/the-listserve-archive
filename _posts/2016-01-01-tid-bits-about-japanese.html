      \ use higher status vocabulary for yourself and lower\r\nfor the other person.\
      \ You use different words for \"I\" and \"You\" and if\r\nyou are Yakuza-style\
      \ all the words start to end in \"eeeee\" ;)\r\nJapanese has two syllable-alphabets\
      \ and uses Chinese characters (Kanji)\r\nas well. Until 2010 the standard set\
      \ of Kanji to be used in\r\nofficial documents, newspapers etc (the so-called\
      \ \"daily used\r\ncharacters\") were 1945. In 2010 they increased that number\
      \ by 196 new\r\ncharacters (and removed 5) because all the people are using\
      \ computers\r\nand cell phones to communicate nowadays, thus writing by hand\
      \ is not so\r\nimportant anymore and adding more characters is therefore not\
      \ that much\r\nof a problem. What reading Japanese makes hard is that one Kanji\
      \ in Japanese can have\r\nup to 12 ways readings - depending on the word it\
      \ is used in or which\r\nsyllables follow. In Chinese one character has one\
      \ reading. The reason\r\nis that for one Chinese and Japanese are very different\
      \ languages with\r\nChinese being a tonal one and Japanese being a language\
      \ that isn't\r\ntonal, thus characters got several usages. In addition there\
      \ were\r\nseveral phases words got imported from China and each time another\r\
      \nChinese dialect was the base for the final Japanese reading. The consequence\
      \ is that its hard to learn to read Japanese. And when you\r\nneed to use paper\
      \ dictionaries, you use two dictionaries usually. One\r\ncharacter-dictionary\
      \ and another one which is more like a traditional\r\none. With experience you\
      \ get pretty good in guessing the readings, but\r\nits always a lot of searching\
      \ if the searched combination of characters\r\nisn't already in the character\
      \ dictionary.\r\nThe origins of Japanese are unclear but it is probably an Altaic\r\
      \nlanguage with relations to Turkish and Mongolian. The language closest\r\n\
      to Japanese is Korean. You can easily translate one language into the\r\nother.\
      \ What is most interesting is that they are grammatically very\r\nsimilar but\
      \ the lexic (the words) is totally different. I.e. the word\r\n\"to eat\" is\
      \ \"taberu\" but \"meogda\" in Korean. But when you get to words\r\nloan from\
      \ Chinese, someone who knows Japanese can get a lot of knowing\r\nKanji (Hanja\
      \ in Korean) and what the Korean reading for the character\r\nis. Korean also\
      \ uses only one reading for a Hanja. But nowadays Hanja\r\nare rarely used in\
      \ Korean. But Korean has with Hangeul the best\r\n\"alphabet\" ever. It's easier\
      \ to learn to read and write than any other\r\nI've seen. Thanks to a king in\
      \ the 15th century who ordered scientists\r\nto develop an alphabet that is\
      \ easy to learn for increasing alphabetism.\r\nIn the past there were times\
      \ when people tried to get rid of Chinese\r\ncharacters in Japanese but it never\

      \ syllable alphabets. I can\r\nunderstand why. Japanese is far easier to skim\

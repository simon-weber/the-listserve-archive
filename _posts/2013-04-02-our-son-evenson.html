      <p>Evenson&#8217;s English is getting better. The weekly classes are paying
      off, but he struggles with proper grammar.</p>

      <p>Evenson is 14 and he&#8217;s in the fourth grade. It&#8217;s not because
      he&#8217;s unintelligent. He&#8217;s actually quite brilliant&#8212;he works
      well his hands and learns quickly. But Evenson is behind in school because most
      years his family couldn&#8217;t afford to send him. He&#8217;s the oldest of
      five, and his father is dead. For several years, his mom raised him and his
      sister, Ludmia, as a widow. Then she remarried and quickly had three more little
      ones. Feeding the kids was more important than paying tuition.</p>

      <p>My wife, Sonja, and I hear his crackly voice come through Skype. He offers
      us a chicken, and it takes a second for the words&#8212;then the profound gesture&#8212;to
      register.</p>

      <p>Evenson has one rooster (k&#242;k) and two hens (poul). Three chickens. And
      he wants to give us one.</p>

      <p>His simple gesture grips us and we just melt.</p>

      <p>Melting. That happens often in Haiti. And it happens particularly often with
      Evenson.</p>

      <p>Sonja met him first. We were with a team in Carrefour and Evenson tagged
      along because following twenty blan was more interesting than not. He spoke
      enough English to tell her his name, and the two set to drawing pictures in
      a notebook and learning snippets of each other&#8217;s language: tree and pye,
      dog and chen, car and machin.</p>

      <p>Quickly, they became inseparable. He spent every day glued to Sonja, learning
      new words and listening to Michael Jackson on her iPod (He loves to sing, and
      his voice cracks now).</p>

      <p>I melted the first time, I think, when Evenson made a heart from a plastic
      bottle cap rig and gave it to Sonja. She gave him a hair tie to wear on his
      wrist.</p>

      <p>We took him to the beach, and Sonja carried him on her back into the water.
      I watched the two of them spin and splash in the waves while joy just washed
      over me.</p>

      to do volunteer work, develop relationships with community leaders, visit friends
      and, mainly, to see Evenson.</p>

      <p>With less money than we would spend on a weekend getaway, we helped Evenson&#8217;s
      parents start a business. Now Evenson, Ludmia, and his brother Josie go to school.
      The seven-person family also moved from a small tent to a small room that makes
      our two-bedroom apartment appear like a mansion.</p>

      <p>You can&#8217;t be in Haiti without being overwhelmed by the poverty. Simple

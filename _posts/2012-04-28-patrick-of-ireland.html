    body: "Once upon a time \u2014 and listen, for although this sounds like a fable,\
      \ I will try to make every word true \u2014 once upon a time there was a young\
      \ boy named Patrick, a young Christian boy whose father was a deacon, and whose\
      \ grandfather was a priest. Patrick, though he was raised in a Christian household\
      \ did not himself know God. I imagine he was like most people, just living his\
      \ life out without much concern for spiritual things.\r\n\r\nBut then something\
      \ really terrible happened. Raiders attacked his parents\u2019 villa, and Patrick\
      \ was taken off to be a slave in Ireland. I suspect that his parents had plans\
      \ for him to go off to the city to become an educated gentleman. Instead, he\
      \ was taken off at age sixteen to become a slave. Instead of going to school,\
      \ he was forced to become a shepherd.\r\n\r\nIn his loneliness and emptiness,\
      \ he began to remember what he knew about God. And he started to pray the prayers\
      \ he had been taught; I don\u2019t know what prayers, but I imagine he prayed\
      \ the \u201COur Father.\u201D He started praying more and more \u2014 in the\
      \ fields at night and during the day, even waking up before daylight to pray,\
      \ praying up to, he says, 100 prayers in a day. God started to burn in him.\r\
      \n\r\nHe was a slave until he was about twenty, and then something very spooky\
      \ but real happened. He was sleeping, but he heard a voice saying he was going\
      \ home soon. Soon after he heard the voice again saying that his boat was ready.\
      \ He immediately fled from his slave-owner, for he recognized that this was\
      \ a message directly from God. He had to travel 200 miles to get to the harbor\
      \ where the ship was, in a land he did not know, among people whom he did not\
      \ know.\r\n\r\nHe found the ship, and they almost didn\u2019t take him. After\
      \ the visions and after walking 200 miles, I imagine he was disappointed. He\
      \ headed back to the hut where he was staying praying along the way. As he was\
      \ walking and praying, one of the men shouted at him to come back; he could\
      \ get a ride with them.\r\n\r\nThey traveled for three days before they landed,\
      \ and then the whole group started walking \u2014 after twenty-eight days, their\
      \ food ran out, and it was uninhabited. His companions were kind to have taken\
      \ him in, but now they were hungry and cranky, and began to taunt him about\
      \ God, asking that perennial question: If God is so great and powerful, why\
      \ isn\u2019t God helping us?\r\n\r\nPatrick had good reason to trust that God\
      \ had something other than starving in mind for them, though, and he told them\
      \ boldly that they should become Christians. He also said that God was going\
      \ to provide so much food that very day that they couldn\u2019t eat any more.\
      \ And so it happened: a herd of pigs came by, and I imagine they had a pretty\
      \ good pork barbecue. Their attitude towards God and Patrick changed that day;\
      \ in fact, they had fire and food enough for the rest of their journey.\r\n\r\
      \nPatrick eventually was able to return to his kinsfolk, and he was glad to\
      \ return, and they were glad to have him. But Patrick had another dream: a man\
      \ named Victorius bringing letters from Ireland, and in his dream he read one\
      \ of the letters. The letter said it was \u201CThe Voice of the Irish,\u201D\
      \ and he could hear the voices of people he knew in Ireland begging him to return\
      \ to return to the land of his slavery.\r\n\r\nSo Patrick returned to Ireland\
      \ to preach. He didn\u2019t cast out the snakes; we don\u2019t know if he used\
      \ a shamrock to teach the Trinity; the hymns attributed to him are most likely\
      \ not by him. But we know he continued to face hardship. In fact, he was kidnapped\
      \ at least one more time for two months. Patrick\u2019s life was full of ups\
      \ and downs, He was ashamed of his poor education (poor man, he only knew three\
      \ or so languages and wrote his confession in Latin that was perhaps not up\
      \ to par). He called himself a stutterer, though he preached to thousands. He\
      \ felt that \u201Cpoverty and failure suited him better than wealth and delight.\u201D\
      \ He certainly never got wealthy ministering to the Irish. He remained homesick,\
      \ I think, to the end of his days. But he recognized the work of God through\
      \ him, but he felt bound by the Spirit to remain in Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nWill\

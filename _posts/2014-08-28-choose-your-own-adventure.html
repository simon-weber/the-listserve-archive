      \ in progress. Right now, I\u2019m in Washington, DC, staring down an overpriced\
      \ coffee, pondering life and where my next chapter begins.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve\
      \ been to the foot of Mount Ararat. I\u2019ve snorkeled with sharks in the Andaman\
      \ Sea. I\u2019ve been held at gunpoint by Chechen Mafiosi and stood at the bottom\
      \ of the stairs of Air Force One. I\u2019m fun at parties. I\u2019ve rolled\
      \ naked in the snow after a Russian sauna, been knocked into a sewer in Uzbekistan,\
      \ and on the first day of my current job, I was blessed by the Dalai Lama. I\u2019\
      m a storyteller, a total geek, a devoted friend, and I\u2019m as capable of\
      \ loving and being loved passionately and fully as anyone else you will meet.\r\
      \n\r\nI\u2019m also fat.\r\n\r\nWith many people, that\u2019s all they see,\
      \ all they care to know, and all they think I am.\r\n\r\nIt saddens me when\
      \ people judge me exclusively on my physical form. It kills me that many see\
      \ me as less human than they are\u2014less worthy of respect, dignity, decency,\
      \ or love\u2014because of the curves of my body. It infuriates me that I still\
      \ sometimes let it bother me.\r\n\r\nMy mom was a pilot\u2014a WASP\u2014in\
      \ WWII. She dealt with bigotry, ignorance, and even aircraft sabotage for the\
      \ honor and duty of flying some of the most exciting\u2014and dangerous\u2014\
      warbirds ever to grace the sky. She always told me to take chances, follow the\
      \ more challenging path, and never let anything stop me. I try to remember her\
      \ advice every time a stranger randomly passes judgment on me for my weight.\r\
      \n\r\nScrew \u2018em.\r\n\r\nI am not defined by my body. Neither are you. Definitions\
      \ are limitations. Defy definition, embrace your quirks, be good to others,\
      \ and be as happy as you can. As for me, I\u2019ll keep moving forward, with\
      \ joy and adventure in my heart.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a little of my personal\
      \ philosophy for getting through this life:\r\n\r\n- You are your own best advocate\u2014\
      for health, for work, for choosing the life path you need to take. Don\u2019\
      t wait for others to take you by the hand and show you the way.\r\n\r\n- Do\
      \ crazy adventurous things, even if you get hurt now and then. You will have\
      \ amazing stories\u2014and possibly awesome scars\u2014to share for the rest\
      \ of your life.\r\n\r\n- Don\u2019t be afraid to love people, even if some don\u2019\
      t love back. Just know when to cut your losses and move on. (Still working on\
      \ this myself.)\r\n\r\n- Buy your own roses. You deserve them.\r\n\r\n- Carve\
      \ out a little portion of time every day to do something creative or something\
      \ that feeds your passion. And share what you make! If you put it out there,\
      \ you can\u2019t hide in fear of rejection. Good, bad, ugly, totally unabashedly\
      \ cheesy\u2014boldly embrace what gives you joy.\r\n\r\nRecently, I resurrected\
      \ my long-dormant blog and cleaned off my drawing table. I find contentment\
      \ in the moments I steal to draw or write, and I\u2019m grateful for the indulgence\
      \ of friends on social media in encouraging me for what I post\u2014my tentative\
      \ steps toward a real creative leap of faith.\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago, I found\
      \ out that my job is likely ending around Christmas. Facing down 50, I have\
      \ to re-invent myself. Is this the time to take that huge creative leap? I think\

      <p>My name is Melissa, I&#8217;m 48, and I''m a work in progress. Right now,
      I&#8217;m in Washington, DC, staring down an overpriced coffee, pondering life
      and where my next chapter begins.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve been to the foot of Mount Ararat. I&#8217;ve snorkeled with sharks

      <p>I am not defined by my body. Neither are you. Definitions are limitations.

      Just know when to cut your losses and move on. (Still working on this myself.)</p>

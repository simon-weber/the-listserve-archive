    body: "Hi everyone. One of my goals in life is to go to all the Disneylands. I'm\
      \ not really sure why, because i'm not a big Disney fanatic. But I guess I did\
      \ grow up watching Disney movies when I was younger, so it's probably subconsciously\
      \ brainwashed me. I think the appeal for me is how Disneyland brings out the\
      \ kid in you, irregardless of what age you are.\r\n\r\nThe first time I went\
      \ to Disneyland was in America when I was 5, and it was my first trip overseas.\
      \ Going to Disneyland is probably the greatest thing that could happen to a\
      \ 5 year old. For whatever reason, I have a vivid memory of being in Mickey's\
      \ house and seeing his clothes in the washing machine, thinking he was trapped\
      \ inside. Obviously, I was a stupid 5 year old.\r\n\r\nMy second Disneyland\
      \ experience was in Hong Kong at 15 years old, and most recently, 20 years old\
      \ in Paris. Even at 20, I found myself running around the park with my (older)\
      \ sister trying to find Mickey to get a photo. My favourite ride would have\
      \ to be the laser shooting Buzz Lightyear one. I'm not sure if my laser gun\
      \ was faulty, or if I was just really good at that game, but I managed to get\
      \ over 37,000 points - whereas everyone else around me were sitting at around\
      \ 5000 tops. I like to think the latter. (And to my lovely sister, I'm still\
      \ laughing at your inferior 2,900 points, ha!)\r\n\r\nI still haven't had a\
      \ chance to visit Japan... so that is definitely next on the list, and it can\
      \ hopefully be ticked off in the next year or so.\r\n\r\nRe-reading this feels\
      \ kind of silly because it's such a trivial goal to have, but I guess to put\
      \ it in perspective for myself - in going to all the Disneylands, it encourages\
      \ me to keep travelling and seeing more of the world. And, I really do love\
      \ that Buzz Lightyear game.\r\n\r\nThanks for letting me share this silly insight\
      \ into myself! And hope you're having a lovely day/night wherever you are!\r\

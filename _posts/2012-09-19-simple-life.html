      <p>I work in sales and deal with angry people everyday and all I ever think
      is, why? Why do you feel the need to belittle me when I''m trying to help you?
      You''re made to feel like you''re  two inches tall, that everything (even the
      things you had nothing to do with) is with) is somehow your fault. The reason
      for someone''s action isn''t always clear but treating someone horribly because
      you''ve had a bad day is just inexcusable.  So if you feel like flying off the
      handle and screaming at someone please stop, take a breath, and imagine if you
      were in their position. You just might change your tone. </p>

      <p>-Handmade and from the heart. </p>

<p>I was surprised when I finally got the chance to say something to you. I wrote this few years ago when I had an inner battle with my faith. You know, the kind of thing that makes you ponder why life sometimes can be so unfair. I hope this will answer the question you've been asking the Universe.</p>
<p>For these past few weeks, I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot. I&#8217;ve been trying to find reasons. Answers for my why(s). Then I came up with this :</p>
<p>There is no such thing as free will. I never had a choice.</p>
<p>Even if there is, They always leave me with cruel choices They force me to make. I never had a choice.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had my time thanking the Universe. I&#8217;ve also had time blaming it on the Cosmic Irony. I&#8217;ve been through anger and I&#8217;ve also been to acceptance, back and forth. I got to the point where I could not go with this wandering-around-the-vicious-circle anymore.</p>
<p>Yesterday, it just occurred to me that I was wrong.</p>
<p>Choices. Yes they have always been cruel. Of course They would never give us the easy way with choices.</p>
<p>Free will. All this time, I&#8217;ve been closing my eyes and choosing to not see the big picture. It&#8217;s not about the choices or how cruel they are. It&#8217;s about the way you see them. That&#8217;s our free will. Choosing the way you see those cruel choices. It&#8217;s either you keep bargaining and angry with it or just accept and be grateful, for in the end whatever choice we made, it would turn on a dime. Sure the journey will be tough. But you can make it less hard by seeing them differently now.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing you can do about those choices. It has to be made. Just believe that someday you&#8217;ll thank Them for the cruel path They&#8217;ve given to you for it helps you grow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Valuable things have a way of being misunderstood in their own time.</p>
<p>Everyone wants a quick fix, they always have.&#8221;</p>

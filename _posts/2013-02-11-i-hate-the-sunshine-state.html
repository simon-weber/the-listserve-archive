    \ this time in my life. Isn't that always the case?\r\n\r\nDo you ever have the\
    \ overwhelming feeling that picking just one \u201Cfavorite\u201D is ridiculous?\
    \ I always had a weird jealousy of people who could pick a favorite color, and\
    \ it would be their favorite for their entire lives. Buddy, give me the rainbow.\
    \ There are so many beautiful colors in this world, how could anyone pick just\
    \ ONE?! My favorite colors have always shifted during different stages of my life.\r\
    \n\r\nDuring a particularly rebellious phase, it was always shades of blue, because\
    \ I didn\u2019t want to be a girly-girl and was in a heavy tomboy phase (boys\
    \ are blue, and girls are pink!). Going through several depressed years, it was\
    \ all kinds of grey, then black. Anxiety has always drawn me to oranges; emerging\
    \ from the depression, I found hope and fell in love with yellow. When harder\
    \ times hit, I found my favorites to be pastel yellows and lavendars, offset with\
    \ steely greys, as I found it well represented my internal battles. Recently,\
    \ I went through a hyper-extroverted phase, and refused to commit to a \u201C\
    favorite\u201D color at all, instead saying that I loved all neons.\r\n\r\nIf\
    \ you were to guess that I\u2019m an artist, you would be right. My favorite colors,\
    \ nowadays, are purple, then yellow. I feel happy and passionate most days, and\
    \ love how those two work together.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve spent a few years studying\
    \ color theory, and how it relates to emotions; isn\u2019t it fascinating that\
    \ painting a primary shade of red will spark anger and aggression in people? That\
    \ the awful seafoam green of hospital walls is meant to promote healing and soothing?\
    \ Moderate, pastel-leaning hues of blue are believed to promote ideas, and aide\
    \ with thinking. The biggest change one can make to a room is painting it a new\
    \ color, no joke!\r\n\r\nNow, before you start calling me a crackpot, go hit up\
    \ the Googles, and do a quick bit of reading. Color has an effect on our brains,\
    \ whether you believe it or not. Think back to the movie Sixth Sense (anyone here\
    \ old enough to remember that?), and the glorious use of red. It was fantastic,\
    \ and subtle, and overwhelming, once you noticed it. What a great depth of meaning\
    \ given by the use of color.\r\n\r\nThe next time you\u2019re in a gallery, museum,\
    \ or bookstore, stop and look at the colors. Artists and designers spent hours\
    \ agonizing over them, just to help you feel a certain way. Pretty wild.\r\n\r\
    \nSo now I\u2019m curious. What\u2019s your favorite color? Does it change? If\
    \ it does, do you feel like it\u2019s gone along with certain overarching moods\
    \ that you\u2019ve been in?\r\n\r\nFinally, I have to take a moment for a personal\
    \ plug, here. I\u2019m a painter in my free time, using color theory to make abstract,\
    \ emotionally driven pieces, and am trying to get my work out. If you\u2019re\
    \ at all interested, I\u2019d love to put a piece in your hands, wherever you\
    \ happen to be. If not, I leave you with my personal motto, and hope you realize\
    \ that it\u2019s true. \u201CYou Are Precious.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nIrina\t\r\nlistserve.me@gmail.com\t\

<p class="meta">November 09 2012</p>

<p>It is a cold September evening. A girl, tall, a bit shy, has her first ballroom dancing lesson. Her friends have persuaded her to go. But her concerns about not meeting a boy who is tall enough are quickly forgotten because of him.</p>
<p>While learning the first steps of Slow Waltz, the two enjoy a nice chat and...like each other on first sight. It is time to say goodbye. But no, both are by bike and both are heading the same direction.</p>
<p>When the girl tells her mother of him, he is not an unknown. His grandmother is one of her customers.</p>
<p>When he comes home, he tells his mother that he has met the Love of his Life! She is skeptical because he is only 14.</p>
<p>They become a couple. But happy times shall not last very long. Her inner wound turns out to be a big obstacle. After only 6 months, he breaks up with her.</p>
<p>They are now going separate ways, but connected through an invisible band... for 3.5 years! Their love is given a second chance. Everything could be perfect. But life does not always follow logical rules. While she is healed, he feels lost and uncertain. It takes some time to recover.</p>
<p>*Magic evening at musical &#8220;Lion King&#8221; *Message in a bottle she buried for him *Proposal accompanied by two shooting stars *Many occurences of &#8220;7&#8221;, crowned by the Wedding on 07.07.2007</p>

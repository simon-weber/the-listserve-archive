      \ neuroscience student at Northeastern University, in Boston. Back home, in\
      \ Raleigh, North Carolina, I have a pediatrician mom and a pharmaceutical-chemist\
      \ dad, a 16-year-old brother who\u2019s already seven inches taller than me,\
      \ and a ten-year-old tortoiseshell cat who opens all our cabinets.\r\n\r\nThis\
      \ past year has, overall, been a great one. Northeastern is a fantastic school,\
      \ with all these completely unique opportunities, and I have more close friends\
      \ than I\u2019ve ever had at once in my life, some of whom I\u2019m certain\
      \ I\u2019ll still be friends with decades from now.\r\n\r\nAnd Boston is such\
      \ an incredible city. It\u2019s easy to get around, there are delicious restaurants\
      \ and interesting things around practically every corner, and nearly everyone\
      \ I\u2019ve met has been welcoming and friendly. People back home told me I\
      \ was going to hate it up here because of how rough the winters are, and admittedly\
      \ this past February tested my resolve a little, but it made the spring all\
      \ the sweeter when it finally arrived in late March. I really couldn\u2019t\
      \ be happier with my choice to come up here, is what I\u2019m saying. And honestly,\
      \ I could see myself spending the rest of my life here.\r\n\r\nExcept.\r\n\r\
      \nAs much as I wanted to get the heck out of North Carolina after 18 years of\
      \ living there, I\u2019ve found myself missing parts of it far more than I expected,\
      \ sometimes. I think the food is probably the biggest thing (what do you MEAN,\
      \ you\u2019ve never had pimento cheese, or grits, or barbecue?!?), but there\
      \ are days I just long for the mountains, or the beaches, or my home region,\
      \ the Triangle (the nickname for Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill). For all its flaws,\
      \ North Carolina is home to a lot of beauty, and a lot of potential. There are\
      \ great universities and companies conducting promising research, and the local\
      \ food/art/music scene is flourishing. More and more people move there every\
      \ day.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s enough to make me want to go\
      \ back. I had good reasons for wanting to leave. And I really do like it up\
      \ here.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m just terrified that no matter where I end up I\u2019\
      ll never be completely happy, because if I go back to where I came from, I\u2019\
      ll remember why I originally left, but if I go anywhere else, I\u2019ll still\
      \ miss North Carolina on some level, however small.\r\n\r\nSo far the best way\
      \ I\u2019ve come up with to deal with this is by carrying little bits of North\
      \ Carolina with me, up here. I cook Southern food for my friends, and tell them\
      \ stories and traditions from my home state, and always, always use \u201Cy\u2019\
      all\u201D instead of \u201Cyou guys.\u201D Little bits. Little reminders of\
      \ the place I came from.\r\n\r\nSo far it\u2019s been good enough.\r\n\r\nI\u2019\
      d love to hear from other people who moved far away from their birthplaces when\
      \ they became adults. How did you cope with it? Did you leave regretfully, or\

      \n\r\nAnyone who lives in Boston: what\u2019s your favorite place to eat/thing\

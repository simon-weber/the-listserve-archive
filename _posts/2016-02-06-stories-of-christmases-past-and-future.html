      A collection of stories about Christmases past, which coincidentally tie together\
      \ a number of things I\u2019m passionate about.\r\n\r\n2012 \u2013 Tokyo, Japan\r\
      \n\r\nAn impulse decision \u2013 my first trip as a new \u2018solo mum\u2019\
      \ (hate that term!). I\u2019d never travelled on my own, and now my 6 year old\
      \ daughter and I were heading to a non-English speaking country where I knew\
      \ nobody. I felt physically sick with worry that Christmas day as I boarded\
      \ my flight.\r\n\r\nIn hindsight, Japan was amazing, we Couchsurfed and met\
      \ wonderful people. Don\u2019t ever believe you can\u2019t travel with children.\
      \ Since then we\u2019ve both backpacked in Russia, Mongolia, Egypt, Kazakhstan\
      \ and Chile (to name a few).\r\n\r\n\r\n2013 \u2013 New Zealand\r\n\r\nStarted\
      \ an 8 month relationship with a man who was emotionally abusive. Lesson: Value\
      \ yourself, you are worth more than that, don\u2019t put up with that shit.\
      \ And call the police immediately if it ever gets physical. Don\u2019t be embarrassed.\
      \ Learn and move on.\r\n\r\n\r\n2014 \u2013 Bethlehem, West Bank\r\n\r\nThe\
      \ home of Christmas. We visited the Church of the Nativity and Manger Square,\
      \ then spent the evening and Boxing Day with an amazing family full of love.\
      \ They truly redefined for me what family was all about. We cooked and ate together,\
      \ and their children and my daughter played and explored outside. It was a perfect\
      \ couple of days.\r\n\r\nNow \u2026 stop a moment and reflect on the picture\
      \ you have built about that story. What does that family look like to you? In\
      \ reality, we were in Bethlehem\u2019s Aida Refugee Camp, and the family was\
      \ Palestinian.\r\n\r\nFor many years my only knowledge of the Israeli/Palestinian\
      \ conflict was what I heard in the media. Before we left I began researching\
      \ and that - in conjunction with what I saw and heard in Israel and the West\
      \ Bank - opened my eyes. If this email succeeds in only igniting your curiosity\
      \ about the Palestinian side of the story, I\u2019d be happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n2015\
      \ \u2013 New Zealand\r\n\r\nA Christmas without my daughter, and without my\
      \ mother who died in 2015. I chose to spend most of the day volunteering at\
      \ a community Christmas lunch. The experience allowed me to not only do something\
      \ for others, which on its own is incredibly rewarding, but made me realise\
      \ I how grateful I should be for what I have. Great life lessons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\

      \ my job when I return to NZ and looking for a NGO, community work, or travel\

      <p>CHRISTMASES PAST</p>

      <p>A collection of stories about Christmases past, which coincidentally tie
      together a number of things I&#8217;m passionate about.</p>

      <p>2012 &#8211; Tokyo, Japan</p>

      <p>An impulse decision &#8211; my first trip as a new &#8216;solo mum&#8217;
      (hate that term!). I&#8217;d never travelled on my own, and now my 6 year old
      daughter and I were heading to a non-English speaking country where I knew nobody.
      I felt physically sick with worry that Christmas day as I boarded my flight.</p>

      <p>In hindsight, Japan was amazing, we Couchsurfed and met wonderful people.
      Don&#8217;t ever believe you can&#8217;t travel with children. Since then we&#8217;ve
      both backpacked in Russia, Mongolia, Egypt, Kazakhstan and Chile (to name a
      few).</p>

      <p><br />2013 &#8211; New Zealand</p>

      <p>Started an 8 month relationship with a man who was emotionally abusive. Lesson:
      Value yourself, you are worth more than that, don&#8217;t put up with that shit.
      And call the police immediately if it ever gets physical. Don&#8217;t be embarrassed.
      Learn and move on.</p>

      <p><br />2014 &#8211; Bethlehem, West Bank</p>

      <p>The home of Christmas. We visited the Church of the Nativity and Manger Square,
      then spent the evening and Boxing Day with an amazing family full of love. They
      truly redefined for me what family was all about. We cooked and ate together,

      <p><br />2015 &#8211; New Zealand</p>

      <p>A Christmas without my daughter, and without my mother who died in 2015.
      I chose to spend most of the day volunteering at a community Christmas lunch.
      The experience allowed me to not only do something for others, which on its
      own is incredibly rewarding, but made me realise I how grateful I should be
      for what I have. Great life lessons.</p>

      <p><br />CHRISTMAS YET TO COME</p>

      <p>2016 &#8211; Cuba / Latin America</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ll be travelling again; my study will be finished; I&#8217;ll be
      about to quit my job when I return to NZ and looking for a NGO, community work,
      or travel role (any offers of work Listserve people?); maybe there even might

<p>I'll keep it brief because I tend to not read the long ones.</p>
<p>From the legendary farmer and real food activist, Joel Salatin:</p>
<p>1. Get involved.<br />2. Read widely.<br />3. Come home.</p>
<p>Do these three things and I think you'll have a better chance of being happy, content, and creating meaningful relationships. It's working for me.</p>
<p>To hear more from the interview where Joel talks about those things, you can just Google "Bulletproof Exec podcast #29" and the specific part is at the 57:30 mark.</p>
<p>Be well.</p>

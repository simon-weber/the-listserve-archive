    body: "I\u2019m Riley and here are 6 facts about my life:\r\n\r\n1.     I\u2019\
      m currently 17, male, and the 2nd oldest of 9 kids.\r\n\r\n2.     I left high\
      \ school at the sophomore level (I was 15 at the time) and joined a college\
      \ with a charter program and now have an associates in economics and working\
      \ towards a bachelors in either finance or marketing at the University of Las\
      \ Vegas (UNLV).\r\n\r\n3.     Eagle Scout.\r\n\r\n4.     If it isn\u2019t obvious\
      \ yet, I\u2019ve lived in Las Vegas my entire life.\r\n\r\n5.     I fly multi-rotor\
      \ vehicles (DJI Phantom 3 and Syma X5).\r\n\r\n6.     I\u2019ve always been\
      \ LDS (More on that later if you don\u2019t know what that means).\r\nNow to\
      \ the fun part of the message, my actual life story:\r\n          Being born\
      \ and raised in Las Vegas is something unique, besides it being around 115 degrees\
      \ Fahrenheit (46C) during the summer, you get a taste of every culture and industry.\
      \ From people that live in the hotels, to people who just visit for the weekend,\
      \ and to the people that live in the suburbs (Summerlin/Henderson), you can\
      \ get exposed to every lifestyle that exists. This has led me to more opportunities\
      \ than I can count for.\r\n           Growing up in Vegas is a blessing, there\
      \ is always something new to do, see, and live. Whether it may be a new show,\
      \ exhibit, or outdoor activity, my childhood was filled with different experiences.\
      \ As I continue my journey through the last of my teenage years, I have found\
      \ that I have a series of choices that I need to make that will impact the rest\
      \ of my life, and that frightens me. As a person who still doesn\u2019t have\
      \ a fully formed frontal lobe (As most people my age do), I can only hope that\
      \ when I look back on my past self that I will be thankful that I somehow made\
      \ the correct decisions to get to where I may go.\r\nThese decisions include:\r\
      \n\r\n1.     Do I complete a master\u2019s degree after my bachelor\u2019s,\
      \ or do I just stick with my bachelor\u2019s degree?\r\n\r\n2.     Do I serve\
      \ a mission?\r\n\r\n3.     Marriage?\r\n            If you read #2, you now\
      \ probably know that I\u2019m LDS, a Latter-day Saint, or \u201CMormon\u201D\
      , which explains the big family and mission. Regardless of what anyone says\
      \ to me, I will always have the church to thank for my friends, my standards\
      \ of always putting my best effort forward, and for giving me opportunities\
      \ that I otherwise would not have had. Also if you have any questions regarding\
      \ Latter-day Saints/Mormons, please email me, I will be more than happy to answer\
      \ any questions regardless of what it may be (I don\u2019t get offended very\
      \ easily so ask anything whether it may be about our beliefs, standards, etc.).\r\
      \n            Also I dare say I learned the best joke on Earth the other day.\r\
      \nQ: What\u2019s the fastest Liquid on Earth?\r\nA: Milk, it\u2019s pasteurized\

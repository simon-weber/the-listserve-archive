      \ big, and you'll be amazed at the high you get when it goes well. You'll find\
      \ yourself responding without censoring yourself, contributing ideas that you\
      \ can't even remember having, and connecting to your classmates and the characters\
      \ they create. You might also do some 'long form' things, like playing out scenes\
      \ and linking them together- this is where the paying attention thing comes\
      \ in handy! If a course sounds like a bit much, or you don't live near one,\
      \ try this- say yes to everything (within reason), and then say \"yes and\"\
      ... add something! You'll have a much more positive day, I promise.\r\n\r\n\
      Lastly, if you're a performer of any kind- music, dance, anything, learn to\
      \ improvise. Just do it. It doesn't matter what discipline you're in or whether\
      \ you strictly need to be able to improvise (lots of classical musicians would\
      \ wet themselves if you put them on stage and just said go), you'd be amazed\
      \ what it can do for your practise. I love using improv (along with other tools)\

      <p> Theatre improv (think "whose line" or UCB) has within it all of the basic
      elements that you need to be a good and successful person. You know the ones-
      saying yes and supporting ideas, always having people''s backs, paying attention
      (really paying attention), finding what''s working and doing it again and again,
      being brave enough to burst into song or dance, or just get up in front of people
      and feel comfortable and even excited speaking. All of the things that a lot
      of us feel bad at, as if we somehow missed the all-important day in school where
      they taught everybody how to talk to each other and not be weird about it and
      we''re never going to catch up because of it. I grew up shy and awkward, and
      improv has made me feel like a real and whole person- I''m happy on stage, I''m

      You''ll start with little, easy exercises- saying "yes and" to ideas, maybe
      playing games where you can only ask questions, alternate saying words with
      another person, tell a story collectively etc. They all seem little, but they
      add up to something big, and you''ll be amazed at the high you get when it goes

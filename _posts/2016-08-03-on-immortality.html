      <p>I was raised in a Catholic family. While not the most pious bunch, I can
      safely say that most or all of my extended family believe in some form of Heaven.
      "She''s in a better place," they said of my great aunt, Frida. "He''s watching

      <p>How do I deal with that?</p>

      <p>Cryonics.</p>

      <p>Cryonics is the practice of lowering the temperature of an organism such
      that all biological activity (including decay) is suspended.</p>

      <p>There is a consensus among scientists that someday, a suspension of neural

      Cryopreservation can be as cheap as $28,000, and you don''t have to pay this
      in cash - the usual way of paying for cryonics is to purchase a life insurance
      policy that pays out to your cryonics provider upon your death. A term life

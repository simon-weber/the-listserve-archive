      \ I was born inside the Bible Belt town of Huntsville, Alabama. It was a magical\
      \ place \u2013 full of overflowing Southern hospitality and a relaxed pace of\
      \ life, juxtaposed by the clattering sounds of space shuttles being engineered\
      \ within the headquarters of NASA.\r\n\r\nAs a 5 year old, I remember feeling\
      \ a sense of wonder and affection when meeting a stranger. Without any preconceived\
      \ stereotypes in my head, each person I met, whether young or old, black or\
      \ white, foreign or American, was a tabula rasa, a blank window into a new world.\r\
      \n\r\nAlthough I didn\u2019t know what it was at the time, I now realize what\
      \ I had as a child. Not only me, but what we ALL have as children, until many\
      \ of us lose it upon entering adulthood. The ancient Greeks called this \u201C\
      agape.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CAgape\u201D means \u201Clove\u201D, but it is love\
      \ that\u2019s beyond aesthetic or romantic love. Agape is understanding, redemptive\
      \ good will for all men. It\u2019s an overflowing love that seeks nothing in\
      \ return. As children we innately have this. As adults, we experience this love\
      \ in 2 ways: First, we believe that people are good, deep down, regardless of\
      \ what they do. Second, we find the courage to love the person who commits an\
      \ evil deed, while taking action to right the wrong they committed.\r\n\r\n\
      In this era of technological innovation, we let Facebook news feeds re-iterate\
      \ our preconceived notions, and 140-characters dictate opinion based on popularity,\
      \ not logical reasoning. Our voices flutter within bubbles, echoing opinions\
      \ we enjoy while discarding perspectives that are contrary to our beliefs.\r\
      \n\r\nYet, despite the horrors we\u2019re seeing online - children being massacred\
      \ in Aleppo, opioid drug abuse ravaging Appalachia, climate change skeptics\
      \ appointed to lead the EPA - we cannot forget what courageous free women and\
      \ men can achieve when imagination is joined towards a common purpose.\r\n\r\
      \nWith \u201Cagape\u201D must come action. Action to fight for what we believe\
      \ in, action to preserve the magnificent beauty of our world, action to cause\
      \ future historians to say, \u201C2016 was a dreadful year for humanity, but\
      \ thank GOD for 2017.\u201D\r\n\r\nTo act on this courage, sometimes all we\
      \ need is 60 seconds. 60 seconds of our time to push a tiny domino.\r\n\r\n\
      Do you have 60 seconds right now?\r\n\r\nHere are two initiatives making a true\
      \ difference as you are reading this. Right now, take 60 seconds to act on one\
      \ of them:\r\n\r\nSave Syrian children from being massacred in airstrikes by\
      \ donating $10 to the White Helmets, a civil defense group of unarmed volunteers\
      \ in Syria that bravely rush into the rubble of buildings hit by airstrikes\
      \ to save families.\r\n\r\nHave a conversation with someone outside of your\
      \ social media bubble by signing up for Still One Nation, an application that\
      \ joins you in a video chat with two other people of different perspectives\
      \ contrary to your own. (stillonenation dot org)\r\n\r\nWhomever you are in\
      \ this beautiful world, I give all my peace and love to you.\r\n\r\nP.S. \u2013\
      \ Hey Listserv, did I mention I\u2019m a musician that creates electronic music?\

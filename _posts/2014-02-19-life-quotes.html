      \ University, currently in my sophomore year. I love writing, photography, traveling,\
      \ meeting new people and being in the outdoors. I have no idea what I want to\
      \ do with my life and I'm currently in full exploration. Sometimes it's hard\
      \ feeling completely lost, especially when so many people are focused on finding\
      \ that one set path to success -- but recently, I've been learning to trust\
      \ myself, and it's been a fantastic journey.\r\n\r\n2014 has been a great year\
      \ for me so far. I've been learning how to be more genuine and authentic to\
      \ who I am, and I've started to search for that same sincerity in other people\
      \ as well. Instead of being all over the place and restless to meet new people\
      \ or see new things, I'm beginning to see the value in simply investing in what\
      \ I have and making more time for who truly matters to me. This has been a beautiful\

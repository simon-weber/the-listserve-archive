<p>I know it's a very hot summer in places right now but these muffins are completely worth it.<br />(Sorry for mixing unit types here, but these are from my notes and what I know works for me)</p>
<p>375g AP flour<br />265g Brown sugar (I prefer dark)<br />2.5tsp Baking powder (from a can opened <6mo ago)<br />0.5tsp Baking soda<br />0.25tsp cinnamon (ground fresh ceylon)<br />0.25tsp nutmeg (ground fresh)<br />0.25tsp salt<br />1.0 egg<br />1.25cup buttermilk<br />0.5cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled<br />2.0tsp vanilla extract<br />1.0cup raspberries<br />1.0cup rhubarb, choppped</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 400F</p>
<p>Topping:<br />0.5cup chopped pecans<br />0.33cup brown sugar, packed<br />0.25tsp cinnamon<br />1.0Tbsp cold butter</p>
<p>Combine ingredients in food processor, pulse until they resemble coarse crumbs</p>
<p>Muffins<br />Whisk together flour, baking {powder,soda}, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt<br />In a separate bowl combine sugar, buttermilk, butter, egg, and vanilla<br />Combine the two mixtures, mixing until roughly combined<br />Add in fruit, stir three times to distribute<br />Pour into muffin liners in a muffin tin (makes 12-18)<br />Sprinkle topping onto batter<br />Bake @400F for 20-25min</p>
<p><br />Notes on muffins:<br />Fresh ground spices are THE BEST. Get a microplane for ~$10 and you'll be set.<br />Nothing in the world smells as good as fresh ground cinnamon and nutmeg.</p>
<p>Having fresh baking powder is important. It reacts with air and loses potentcy.<br />Muffins are chemically levened by the reaction between the acidic buttermilk<br />and tartaric acid in baking powder and the basic baking soda.</p>
<p>Muffins get their texture from being roughly mixed. You only need to mix until<br />all the flour is wet; any more and you risk developing gluten strands and<br />making your muffins chewy, with a cake-like crumb.</p>
<p><br />Enjoy!</p>

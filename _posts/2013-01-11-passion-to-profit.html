    <p>Simple idea really, take local news and put a creative &amp; funny spin to
    it. Which I find to be an enormous amount of fun. Local community supports it,
    people who move to town find it as a cultural guide and folks who move away use
    it as a resource to keep in touch. </p>

    <p>What do you love to do? What can you do that is different? How can you present
    an old idea in a new way?  That''s my challenge to you. Find what you love, twist
    it to make it new. Have fun and make a little profit. Who knows, it could blow
    up big time. Passion to profit. </p>

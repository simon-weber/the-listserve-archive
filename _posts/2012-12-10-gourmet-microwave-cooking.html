<p>Here are some simple recipes to get you started with microwave cooking!</p>
<p><br />Pasta:</p>
<p>1) Find a microwavable bowl.</p>
<p>2) Fill with pasta and water</p>
<p>3) Microwave for 10 minutes</p>
<p>4) Burn yourself on the bowl as you remove it from the microwave</p>
<p><br />Ghetto Chicken Parmesan:</p>
<p>1) Take microwaveable chicken nuggets</p>
<p>2) Add splash of tomato sauce (from jar)</p>
<p>3) Add cheese</p>
<p>4) Microwave</p>
<p><br />Ghetto Pad Thai:</p>
<p>1) Follow pasta recipe, swapping pasta for brick of ramen noodles (WITHOUT FLAVOR PACKET)</p>
<p>2) Add a big ol&#8217; glob of peanut butter</p>
<p>3) Microwave</p>
<p><br />Ghetto Omelet:</p>
<p>1) Follow Pasta Step 1</p>
<p>2) Fill with egg and cheese</p>
<p>3) Microwave until egg is rubbery instead of slimy</p>
<p><br />Finally, I&#8217;d like to take a second to be selfish.  To be completely honest with you, when I found out that I got to write one of these emails, I thought to myself, &#8220;How can I profit off of this?&#8221;  Well, my paypal account is the same as my email address, so if you want to throw me a couple of dollars, it would be an easy way for you to make a broke college kid&#8217;s day.  I&#8217;ll be honest, I&#8217;ll probably (definitely) spend it on pizza and beer, but damn if I won&#8217;t enjoy it.  And if you&#8217;re curious as to how much money I&#8217;ve made from strangers, or anything else about me, just ask and I&#8217;ll tell you!</p>

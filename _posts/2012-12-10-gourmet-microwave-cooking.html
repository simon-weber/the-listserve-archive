      \ and water\r\n\r\n3) Microwave for 10 minutes\r\n\r\n4) Burn yourself on the\
      \ bowl as you remove it from the microwave\r\n\r\n\r\nGhetto Chicken Parmesan:\r\
      \n\r\n1) Take microwaveable chicken nuggets\r\n\r\n2) Add splash of tomato sauce\
      \ (from jar)\r\n\r\n3) Add cheese\r\n\r\n4) Microwave\r\n\r\n\r\nGhetto Pad\
      \ Thai:\r\n\r\n1) Follow pasta recipe, swapping pasta for brick of ramen noodles\

      \n\r\n2) Fill with egg and cheese\r\n\r\n3) Microwave until egg is rubbery instead\
      \ of slimy\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, I\u2019d like to take a second to be selfish.\
      \  To be completely honest with you, when I found out that I got to write one\
      \ of these emails, I thought to myself, \u201CHow can I profit off of this?\u201D\
      \  Well, my paypal account is the same as my email address, so if you want to\
      \ throw me a couple of dollars, it would be an easy way for you to make a broke\
      \ college kid\u2019s day.  I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019ll probably (definitely)\
      \ spend it on pizza and beer, but damn if I won\u2019t enjoy it.  And if you\u2019\
      re curious as to how much money I\u2019ve made from strangers, or anything else\
      \ about me, just ask and I\u2019ll tell you!\r\n\r\n\r\nDaniel Hamilton\t\r\n\

      \ my alma mater was closing. It took the community -- faculty, students, parents,\
      \ and alums -- about a day to figure out that finances were just an excuse for\
      \ something more nefarious that had been in the works for quite a while.\r\n\
      \r\nLong story short, we saved Sweet Briar College. And fortunately, our newfound\
      \ reputation as a college that teaches students not to take no for an answer\
      \ has garnered us record numbers of applications for 2016-17. But no one has\
      \ been held accountable for what almost certainly involves criminal conduct.\
      \ The old \u201Cleadership\u201D simply resigned, and the president walked away\
      \ with hundreds of thousands of dollars of severance (from an interim position!).\r\
      \n\r\nI really hate that the narrative in the media and elsewhere is that the\
      \ college was running out of money until the alumnae swooped in and saved the\

      \ key players were trying to kill Sweet Briar because for them, the value of\
      \ its 3,250-acre campus had eclipsed its 114-year legacy of educating women.\
      \ There are still some gaps in our collective understanding of what happened,\
      \ but here's what we know:\r\n\r\n- The stated reason for the closure was declining\

      \ in both admissions and development had been left unfilled for about two years\
      \ (and despite that, enrollment was only slightly down from the record high).\r\
      \n\r\n- In announcing the closure, the president (who had come to Sweet Briar\
      \ after being fired from his previous college for, among other things, fiscal\
      \ impropriety) pointed to the proportion of students who were minorities, low-income,\
      \ and/or first-generation college students as evidence that the college was\
      \ not worth trying to save. (!!)\r\n\r\n- He also claimed that the $80-90 million\
      \ endowment minus the $55 million that\u2019s restricted to specific purposes\
      \ and $25 million in bond debt (payable over a decade) left the college basically\

      \ who has jurisdiction to prosecute violations of charitable giving laws and\
      \ mismanagement of trusts, not only refused to intervene but actually went to\

      \ (The court sided with the county attorney.) Was the Attorney General motivated\
      \ by campaign contributions from an individual or business who stood to gain\

      \ administration had already begun the process\r\nof seeking the Attorney General's\
      \ permission to use funds for purposes other than those for which they were\
      \ donated, in order to close the college and repurpose the endowment into some\
      \ sort of scholarship fund -- but they wouldn't, and didn't, seek to have those\
      \ same funds unrestricted to use in support of the ongoing operation of the\

<p>Hey! It's cold right here in Brazil! brrrrrr<br />Well, I would like to share with you some things that I did recently and, somehow, changed my life:</p>
<p>I quit my boring strategic consultant&#8217;s life<br />I decided to take a sabbatical year<br />I discovered life (yeah! There's life between 9 am to 18 pm)<br />I went skateboarding at Ibirapuera's Park (Sao Paulo) every afternoon<br />I started studying Social Entrepreneurship<br />I met new (and interesting, inspiring, innovating, brilliant, etc.) people<br />I traveled to the most beautiful place in the world (Chapada Diamantina | Bahia | Brazil)<br />I traveled to other countries<br />I started swimming<br />I started swimming and running<br />I started swimming, running and mountain-biking<br />I started cross-country triathlon competing<br />I made new friends<br />I met old friends<br />I visited a slum<br />I made friends at slums<br />I changed my points of view - I found a new purpose for my life<br />I started my own business<br />I failed in my first own business<br />I met more people - including my current business partners<br />I work at a business that really cares with social and environmental issues<br />I changed my eating habits - now I'd prefer organic foods<br />I found love again<br />I found a girlfriend that inspires me<br />I found a girlfriend that I admire<br />I hugged my mother, father and sister - and said many times that I love them</p>
<p>And today... I feel myself lighter... I laugh every day... I'm in peace.</p>
<p>That's my suggestion to you... try to do things you'll never think you would do. Enjoy, learn more and don't forget the essential point: HAVE A LOT OF FUN!</p>

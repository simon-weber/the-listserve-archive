      \ that I\u2019ve ever read.\r\n\r\nWinning the listserve lotto could not have\
      \ come at a better time.\r\n\r\nTL;DR\r\n1. If you have a hunch to not fully\
      \ open up to or trust someone, trust your instinct.\r\n2. There are people out\
      \ there who won\u2019t understand you. Don\u2019t get too involved with those\
      \ who don\u2019t even try to.\r\n3. Don\u2019t change for someone else- the\
      \ need to change should come from yourself.\r\n4. Make sure to build a circle\
      \ of good, trustworthy friends and remember to do your part on your side of\
      \ the friendship.\r\n5. Hearing is not the same as listening.\r\n\r\nBefore\
      \ the start of 2016, I was hurting over someone who led me on for two months.\r\
      \nBefore the start of 2017, I was hurting over someone who I thought was a good\
      \ friend for a year.\r\n\r\nIt took me several months to get over what happened\
      \ a bit before 2016, and I now wonder how long it\u2019ll take me to fully get\
      \ over what happened two weeks ago.\r\nThe difference in pain from the two scenarios\
      \ is that the first comes with an expectation of getting hurt. It comes with\
      \ a burden to be cautious around that person until you can trust them enough\
      \ to call them your significant other.\r\nThe second scenario only comes with\
      \ an expectation to drift apart, but there is hardly a burden. When you think\
      \ of someone as a good friend, there\u2019s a certain level of trust that has\
      \ been built. You can easily be yourself around them and they won\u2019t judge\
      \ you for it because they\u2019ve already accepted who you are.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019\
      s hard to say which pain hurts more. Although it took me nearly half a year\
      \ to get over a guy I liked, the immediate pain that hit me when I saw how easily\
      \ that good friend could throw away a year\u2019s friendship over misunderstandings\
      \ felt so much worse. Seeing someone bark insults while not listening to what\
      \ you\u2019re saying, and not understanding why you were as upset is something\
      \ I won\u2019t forget for a while. He\u2019s someone who I thought I could be\
      \ myself around, understood me and my flaws and still accepted me- an illusion\
      \ that dissolved within a half hour debacle. I asked for a talk with the hope\
      \ that he\u2019d understand my point, only to come out with full confirmation\
      \ that we were no longer going to be good friends. Today, I can\u2019t even\
      \ say we\u2019ll be friends.\r\n\r\nThere were several red flags through the\
      \ year that we talked. Repeating them now makes me scared of the fact that there\
      \ are people who think this way about others, so I won\u2019t. I\u2019ll simply\
      \ address them instead.\r\n1. People are not toys or books. You don\u2019t discard\
      \ them after you get bored or think you\u2019ve \u201Cread through all the chapters\u201D\
      \ (I don\u2019t even know what you could\u2019ve possibly read about anybody\
      \ considering your horrendous ability to listen to others anyway)\r\n2. Getting\
      \ to know someone takes time, and when someone\u2019s opening up to you even\
      \ just a bit- grab it just by listening to what they\u2019re saying. You can\u2019\
      t demand an interesting story, receive one, and then not even listen.\r\n3.\
      \ Hearing how you talk about other people, including your mother, I always knew\
      \ to keep my distance. Thank goodness I did.\r\n4. Some people may not be as\
      \ logical as you think you are, but through all the stories you\u2019ve ever\
      \ told me, I\u2019ve learned the difference between reasonable and logical.\r\
      \n5. Even when you\u2019re ranting about someone, don\u2019t leave out parts\
      \ of the story where you\u2019ve done wrong. Admit to your own faults.\r\n6.\
      \ Per the argument we had:\LDon\u2019t tell anyone to change who they are\L\
      Don\u2019t tell anyone to do anything when you haven\u2019t even tried to understand\
      \ where they\u2019re coming from \LWhen you retell the argument to others, I\
      \ wish you wouldn\u2019t funnel the story to favor your side\r\n\r\nAfter the\
      \ argument, I felt like I had no more friends. He was really the only person\
      \ I would talk to one-on-one regularly. Besides him, I wasn\u2019t really active\
      \ on social media and I normally wouldn\u2019t initiate private messages unless\
      \ I had some sort of business to take care of. However, as the days went on,\
      \ I realized all the good I did have around me. Although we didn\u2019t talk\
      \ on a regular basis, I knew they were there when I needed them. I\u2019ve been\
      \ myself, they know my flaws, and most importantly- they listened. I never second\
      \ guessed their character and what they thought of people. They\u2019ve seen\
      \ me at my worst and sometimes I would take a step back and wonder why they\
      \ stay.\r\n\r\nMany good things can come out of one bad thing if you look. I\u2019\
      ve grown even more of an appreciation for my friends, and learned that I need\
      \ to show and mend it. I\u2019m also now trying to kick the habit of complaining\
      \ about people and things; I\u2019ve just grown so tired of it and I want to\
      \ not only be surrounded by good vibes, but also emit them.\r\n\r\nTo end this\
      \ incredibly long listserve...\r\nI learned who I was and want to be. Being\
      \ insulted and told you need to change by someone whom you trusted can be brutal\
      \ at first. It seeps into your mind and makes you believe their words. I thought\
      \ I was the shittiest person in the world with the meanest demeanor. Thankfully,\
      \ as if a eureka moment, I realized I am a nice person. I have trouble communicating\
      \ what I really mean, but I know I\u2019m always considering others and I never\
      \ do or say anything with mal-intent. I do have my flaws, but so does everyone\
      \ else, and I can never trust someone who refuses to understand that fact.\r\

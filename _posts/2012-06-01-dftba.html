    <p>The Fault in Our Stars by John Green<br />That this book is about two teenagers
    with cancer should not dissuade you from reading it. It will probably make you
    cry, but it will also make you laugh. It''s an honor to share in this story. You''ll
    fall in love with it.</p>

    <p>Water for Elephants by Sara Gruen<br />This is one of the most engaging stories
    I''ve read. It follows a young man who ends up working in the circus, but the
    best thing about it is that it also follows his life much later on in a nursing
    home. The way the two stories intersect is fantastic.</p>

    <p>The Book Thief by Markus Zusak<br />This is about a girl during WWII told from
    Death''s point of view. Nothing else is like it. It will break you heart, but
    it''s worth it.</p>

    <p>A Walk in the Woods by Bill Bryson<br />Or anything by him. He''s hilarious.</p>

    <p>The Hitchhiker''s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams<br />It seemed obligatory
    to put this on the list, as Towel Day was so recent.</p>

    <p>Since so many others have given life advice, I feel as though I should do so
    as well. The only advice I feel comfortable giving comes from two video bloggers,
    John and Hank Green, who changed my life and introduced me to the best community

    To Be Awesome.</p>

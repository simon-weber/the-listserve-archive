    <p>I''m 40 years old and I was hoping someone could help me. I''m at a time in
    my life where I just don''t know what to do. I wish to have a better job, a better
    paying job. But I was foolish and never went to college. I think I''d make a great
    nurse, but I can''t afford to go back full time, and going at night would take
    about 6 or so years. </p>

    <p>I make about $30,000 a year. It''s an okay amount, but I can''t take care of
    myself. What would happen if my husband got sick and no longer could work? What
    would happen if we divorced? </p>

    <p>I push paper around. It''s so boring. It''s the same thing every day. </p>

    <p>What are some positions I could look into that pay a bit more? I am now making
    an amount that I think is the most a company would be willing to pay me without
    additional schooling. </p>

    <p>I find that all the research I''ve done is misleading. I read I can become

    So then it''s 4 years, which would take me 6 years or more to complete.</p>

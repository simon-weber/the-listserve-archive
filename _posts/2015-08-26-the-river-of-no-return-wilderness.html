    body: "In the spring of 2013, I spent my 23rd birthday in the Frank Church River\

      \ Montana Conservation Corps and it was the last day of our 2-week backcountry\
      \ training hitch where we learned how to build and maintain trails, use crosscut\
      \ saws and essentially survive 20 miles away from the nearest road. I remember\
      \ waking up that morning to near-freezing temperatures with a pit in my stomach.\
      \ I was turning 23 and I felt so behind. I got a degree in International Affairs\
      \ and was immediately disillusioned with the industry; three years prior, I\
      \ had come to terms with being a gay man and yet was too terrified to tell anyone\
      \ or go on a date with a man; I had run thousands of miles away from my homophobic\
      \ family knowing that I had barely any money and couldn't live independently\
      \ for long. That morning I packed up my belongings and set out on the trek out\
      \ of the Middle Fork. Keeping my eyes to the ground as anger and uncertainty\
      \ clouded my head.\r\n\r\nOver the following 9 months, The River of No Return\
      \ wilderness brought me in and gave me a home. My crew and I hiked over a thousand\
      \ miles that summer while rehabilitating numerous miles of trail destroyed by\
      \ the million acre mustang complex fire. There were freak storm-cells that hung\
      \ over the ridges and brought hail, flash floods, and snow (even in July!).\
      \ There were sightings of bears, wolves, moose, and elk and run-ins with an\
      \ interesting cast of characters who work, hunt, and/or live in the forest.\
      \ I remember one particularly chilling moment when we heard over the forest\
      \ service radio that a girl named Hannah Anderson had been abducted and taken\
      \ into the wilderness by a homicidal maniac. We were far away from the sighting\
      \ but I still slept with the radio nestled in the crook of my arm. Other than\
      \ a frustrating government shutdown that  abruptly cut my season short, the\
      \ summer and fall of 2013 has been the highlight of my young life so far.\r\n\
      \r\nThe wilderness calmed me. It took away the anxiety and the fear. It gave\
      \ me the strength to let go and the patience to let things happen on their own.\
      \ Most importantly, it taught how to be happy even when I'm alone. That's important\

<p>In order to get on the bus in Las Vegas, your skateboard has to be in a bag. This usually means pulling a plastic grocery bag out of the bus stop trash can and draping it over the wheels enough so that the bus driver just gives up and nods you on. I took the Rainbow bus south from my house to my best friend&#8217;s house, then we&#8217;d take the Tropicana bus east to Maryland Parkway to Balcony Lights.</p>
<p><br /> The shows were always on punk time so they wouldn&#8217;t be starting for another hour, at least. We&#8217;d go upstairs and read zines or comics in the zine library, our impressionable minds fascinated by the revolutionary ideas of CrimethInc.</p>
<p><br /> We saw Kaospilot, Van Johnson, Bafabegiya, Curl Up and Die, This Virus Makes Us Human, Zann, D&#8217;amore, and End of a Year, maybe all in one summer. These shows were the first time I can remember feeling like a part of something bigger than myself, crowded together with dozens of sweaty bodies, moshing around with the restrained aggression of angry punks that wanted to fuck shit up&#8230; without knocking any of the records off the wall. We had a really cool secret, avant garde and hardcore.</p>
<p><br /> I picked up flyers there for crazy house shows that I&#8217;m still not sure how I convinced my parents to drop me off at. Later, I dropped off flyers there for my own shows. Later still, I came to help clean up and pick through the last of the records as the record store that raised me, closed its doors.</p>
<p><br /> I love Balcony Lights.</p>

<p>My Mom, a schoolteacher, is allergic to kumquats. As a kid, she and I always liked when the music truck would drive through our neighborhood. Imagine my surprise years later when I found out the music truck served ice cream. I love her, and my Dad who showed me how to be man.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m embarrassingly proud of my friends that do impressive and creative things:</p>
<p><br /> Get inspired by Darcie Burrell&#8217;s book &#8216;Fine.&#8217; or &#8216;Sorry Mom&#8217; on her website. I&#8217;ve known her since middle school.</p>
<p><br /> Watch Oh Nickel on YouTube tell more awesome stories and make original music videos. He came with me to Balcony Lights.</p>
<p><br /> Wear Labyrinth Clothing, made by my friend Nader Boraie</p>
<p><br /> Listen to my buddies in the bands Caravels and Leather Lungs.</p>

<p>To Do (Good):</p>
<p>Learn about how Monsanto is the absolute fucking worst.</p>
<p>Read ProPublica online and Howard Zinn offline.</p>
<p>Microfinance; Kiva makes it easy.</p>
<p>Eat less meat. Add nutritional yeast and Bragg&#8217;s aminos liberally, to everything.</p>
<p>Take a theater or improv class. We&#8217;re all just acting here.</p>
<p>Vote(?) and do something about it.</p>
<p>Couchsurf, obviously.</p>
<p>Give trees as gifts &#8211; Arbor Day Foundation.</p>
<p><br /> Set SMART goals. Classify and prioritize them like this: 1) Low Work, High Reward, 2) High Work, High Reward, 3) Low Work, Low Reward, 4) High Work, Low Reward.</p>
<p><br /> Recognize which of the balls you are juggling are rubber and which are glass.</p>
<p><br /> Invest in the places you spend the most time. Remember, you&#8217;ll spend a third of your life in bed too, so get a good one.</p>

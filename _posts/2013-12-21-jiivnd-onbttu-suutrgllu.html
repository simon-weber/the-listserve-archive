      My name is Ritesh and I am from Bangalore, India. I am engineer by profession\
      \ and I'm currently pursuing my dream of starting a software product startup.\
      \ In my spare time, I read as much as time permits, play the guitar, take nature\
      \ walks, and enjoy birdwatching. I also dabble a bit in photography and video\
      \ making. I am a big fan of satire and dark comedy, and I'm writing some material\
      \ to present at a comedy club.\r\n\r\nAfter graduation, I found myself in an\
      \ IT job and married my long time sweetheart Prateeksha. Both Prateeksha and\
      \ I are rationalists and realists, and live in a crazy country called India.\
      \ Having being born in an era where we had access to cable television, western\
      \ media and the internet, our values are a mixture of Indian conservatism and\
      \ western liberalism, and we started realizing very early on our differences\
      \ in culture, living standards, and expectations from life. \r\n\r\nWe both\
      \ decided to follow some rules to make our lives more comfortable and I thought\
      \ it was best to share these ideas with the listserve crowd. \r\n1. Do what\
      \ you love and be the best at it. No recession or economic downturn can affect\
      \ your earning prospects. \r\n2. Pick up a hobby. Learn to play an instrument,\
      \ pick up photography or just watch nature. It will give you peace of mind and\
      \ will also keep you occupied. \r\n3. Stay very close to your workplace. It\
      \ might be more expensive, but the time saved is priceless, and it gives you\
      \ more time with your partner and for your hobbies. \r\n4. Buy a really comfortable\
      \ bed - you sleep for almost a third of your life, why compromise on comfort?\
      \ \r\n5. Whatever tools and technologies your work requires, buy the best the\
      \ money can buy. If you are a professional guitarist, buy the best guitar money\
      \ can buy. If you use computers, buy the latest greatest thing. Better tools\
      \ improve productivity and reduce frustration. \r\n6. Eat healthy and eat at\
      \ the appropriate times of the day. Don't skip meals. During my post grad days,\
      \ I neglected eating and sleeping at the right times and paid a terrible price\
      \ for it. \r\n7. TRAVEL - that's all there's to it in life. Experience everything\
      \ life, culture and nature has to offer. Take at least 2 vacations a year. Need\
      \ not be exotic but you should make a habit of it. Be aggressive about it.\r\
      \n8. Socialize - make new friends, speak to old ones and build long relationships.\
      \ Travel with friends. Visit every wedding, get together and birthday party.\
      \ Don't expect anything from anyone but play your part. Remember that your family\
      \ and friends are you support structure in your time of need. \r\n9. Find a\

      \ sure you find a companion with who you can talk for hours. \r\n\r\nThat's\
      \ it. I followed these simple rules and have found great joy and contentment\
      \ in life. Every decision I take in my life, I assess the impact on these factors\

      <p>All, </p>

      <p>My name is Ritesh and I am from Bangalore, India. I am engineer by profession
      and I''m currently pursuing my dream of starting a software product startup.
      In my spare time, I read as much as time permits, play the guitar, take nature
      walks, and enjoy birdwatching. I also dabble a bit in photography and video
      making. I am a big fan of satire and dark comedy, and I''m writing some material
      to present at a comedy club.</p>

      <p>After graduation, I found myself in an IT job and married my long time sweetheart
      Prateeksha. Both Prateeksha and I are rationalists and realists, and live in
      a crazy country called India. Having being born in an era where we had access
      to cable television, western media and the internet, our values are a mixture
      of Indian conservatism and western liberalism, and we started realizing very
      early on our differences in culture, living standards, and expectations from
      life. </p>

      <p>We both decided to follow some rules to make our lives more comfortable and
      I thought it was best to share these ideas with the listserve crowd. <br />1.

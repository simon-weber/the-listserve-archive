    body: "You take the ferry to the island.\r\nYou take the ferry to the island alone\
      \ because there is no one to go with you, and you are unmoored and without responsibility,\
      \ and it is a wild and terrible feeling.\r\nYou pay your fifteen dollars and\
      \ you take the ferry to the island.\r\nOn the ferry a man talks to you. He is\
      \ from Peru and he is hitting on you but not so much that you mind. He gives\
      \ you his business card, but you will never call. This is your first and last\
      \ conversation, and even though it means something you will never remember the\
      \ details or his name. It is cloudy but the sun will come out later.\r\nHe gives\
      \ you a keychain. It's gold colored metal and it's a tiny replica of an Incan\
      \ sacrificial knife. It has the word \"PERU\" stamped on one side. You give\
      \ him your soapstone necklace.\r\nYou never see him again.\r\nYou step off onto\
      \ the island.\r\nYou step off onto the island and into the fort. You pass under\
      \ the chalk-white stalactites forming from the old concrete, calcium leeching\
      \ from the building in the rain over centuries.\r\nSomeday this will all be\
      \ dust.\r\nYou walk over the dry moat and through the reinforced wooden doors,\
      \ past the tightly turning granite staircase that goes nowhere now but used\
      \ to lead to the overpass for dropping shit on the invaders that never came.\
      \ The yard is in front of you. The sun has come out.\r\nThe yard is green and\
      \ bright and someone is flying a kite but no one picnics here because it's forbidden.\
      \ The horse chestnut trees are to your right, with the warning sign that says\
      \ \"DO NOT EAT THE CHESTNUTS.\" You walk across the lawn.\r\nCannons line the\
      \ walls above you. Stagnant pools occupy the spaces once held by the enormous\
      \ weapons that faced out into the open water. The weapons that searched for\
      \ U-boats. New concrete on old concrete on granite blocks.\r\nThis place is\
      \ haunted.\r\nNo women died on this island, at least none that we know of. Two\
      \ men, deserters, were shot in the 1860s, but no women.\r\nThere was no desperate\
      \ wife who stole the uniform of her enemies and made her way to the kindest\
      \ and gentlest of all the Civil War prisons, she was not caught and was not\
      \ hanged in an oversized black robe. The stories exist to scare children.\r\n\
      But she was seen.\r\nYou walk across the lawn, past the bakery where you sat\
      \ on a windowsill and sang to the nothing in the dry moat below. Past the narrow\
      \ way you explored blindly as a child, at once relieved and disappointed when\
      \ it deposited you right back where you began. Past the old shells sitting on\
      \ the lawn, never to be fired.\r\nYou walk under the arch, and into the dark\
      \ hallway.\r\nYou put your left hand on the wall, cool with condensation even\
      \ in the summer months. You can see the end of the hallway faintly, but it is\
      \ not your destination.\r\nYou walk along the uneven flagstones. No flashlights,\
      \ no cell phones.\r\nYou left hand reaches the corner you cannot see, and you\
      \ turn.\r\nThere is a metal gate at the end of this narrow passage that is locked\
      \ up when school tours are on the island. No one wants to lose a kid in the\
      \ dark room. It is not locked today.\r\nThe room is dark. A single shaft of\
      \ light falls from the ceiling, a few bricks removed for a chimney. You cannot\
      \ see the walls.\r\nThere is only a small shaft of light, too faint to see by.\r\
      \nYou keep your hand to the wall and walk yourself along the far side until\
      \ you reach the back of the room. The sides are curved, and you worry about\
      \ hitting your head.\r\nYou stand in the corner, facing the light.\r\nYou stand\
      \ alone in the dark.\r\nIt doesn't take long for the nameless fear to sink in.\
      \ SOMETHING is here. SOMETHING is dangerous. You cannot see anything but the\
      \ shaft of light.\r\nYou are not alone.\r\nYou stand in the corner and you breathe,\
      \ because you are not dead yet and as long as you can breathe you will be okay.\r\
      \nYou breathe and you tell yourself \"I am the scariest thing in this room.\"\
      \r\nYou tell yourself \"I am the scariest thing in this room.\"\r\nAnd suddenly\
      \ it's true.\r\nYou see by the light of the chimney, the brick walls and the\
      \ worn flagstones. The open gate and the odd remnants of paint.\r\nYou stand\
      \ and you wait for your meal to arrive.\r\nSomeday you will leave this place.\
      \ Someday you will get back on the ferry and everyone will come home and everything\
      \ will go back to normal. Someday this will just be a thing that you did, a\
      \ story for parties. Someday people will laugh with you and think \"how delightfully\
      \ eccentric\" and pretend that they would do the same if they only had the time.\r\
      \nBut they won't.\r\nThey do not walk into dark rooms. They do not look into\
      \ the mirror when there is nothing to see.\r\nYou are the scariest thing in\
      \ this room.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnonymous\r\ninternetwedding@gmail.com\r\nBoston, MA\r\

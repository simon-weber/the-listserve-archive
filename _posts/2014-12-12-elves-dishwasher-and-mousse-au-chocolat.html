      <p>As I was a (very) little girl I used to think that there were little elves
      in our dishwasher who made all the washing, cleaning and drying.<br />I imagined
      them with small water hoses, tiny sponges and towels, running around the dirty
      dishes, climbing above the plates and the glasses, rinsing and scrubbing.</p>

      <p>Once during a winter I had catched a cold and coughed a lot and our dishwasher

      <p>Now I&#8217;m the mother of a two years old and I&#8217;m already curious
      about the kind of tales he&#8217;s going to create for himself.</p>

      <p><br />And case there&#8217;s not enough chocolate in your life a few weeks
      for Christmas, I give you the ultimate recipe for the &#8220;Mousse au chocolat

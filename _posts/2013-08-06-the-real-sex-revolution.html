    \ Why do you think that the time that a girl prevents you from seeing her naked\

    \n\r\nWhat I think is that guys that think that are absolute jerks. And I have\
    \ found the perfect way to spot them and get them out of your life: sleep with\
    \ them. If you do that, and they never pursue anything else with you, it is because\
    \ they are not worthy of your time. If you let yourself go and enjoy the moment,\
    \ and he is able to notice that you are beautiful human being after seeing you\
    \ naked, then you can see where things take you both.\r\n\r\nSo let\u2019s start\
    \ a revolution! The day in which all girls are able to enjoy sex with the people\
    \ they are attracted to without being judged, that will be the day in which men\
    \ will have to find more things to value in women than how much time can they\
    \ hold sex. And that day, my friends, I think we will all be a little bit happier.\
    \ Or, at least, have more fun.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlejandra Costa\t\r\nalejandra.costa.lacruz@gmail.com\t\

    body: "I\u2019ve been working in the online entrepreneurship industry for a little\
      \ over 6 years now \u2013 it\u2019s where I thrive, and where I can bring a\
      \ lot of value.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd even though this is my industry \u2013 even though\
      \ I am a participant, and I love the tools and strategies that are available\
      \ to people now there is something going on that distresses me hugely.\r\n\r\
      \n\r\nI see it everywhere in the community. It\u2019s on Twitter and Facebook,\
      \ it\u2019s in webinars and eBooks.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s deeply unkind and,\
      \ in my opinion, deeply unwise.\r\n\r\n\r\nStop me if you\u2019ve heard one\
      \ of these:\r\n\r\n\r\n*If people really value you, they\u2019ll open their\
      \ wallets for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Most of the people on your list are losers who\
      \ will never pay you \u2013 the important ones are the ones who can.\r\n\r\n\
      \r\n*Make sure you charge premium prices \u2013 you\u2019ll REALLY be able to\
      \ help people who can pay you enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Outsource the boring work\
      \ for as little as possible so YOU can do the high value stuff ONLY you can\
      \ do.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll of this from people who almost unanimously say they want\
      \ to change the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I have to ask:\r\n\r\n\r\nWho do they want\
      \ to change the world FOR?\r\n\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s flip that script a little bit:\r\
      \n\r\n\r\nWhen someone earns $10 an hour, you can be very sure that that hour\
      \ is valuable to them, and they are careful about how they will spend that limited\
      \ resource \u2013 if it\u2019s on you, be grateful.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many\
      \ reasons someone might not have a lot of income to invest in coaching and training\
      \ programs \u2013 none of them is that they aren\u2019t talented, capable, creative\
      \ or worthwhile.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are considerably more people who can pay a\
      \ little than can pay a lot. (And let\u2019s be honest \u2013 that number is\
      \ growing.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t have all of the answers. But I want to be\
      \ having these conversations, and I want to see people asking themselves these\
      \ questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs an entrepreneurial community are we really and truly\
      \ comfortable with saying that those who have ready disposable income are better,\
      \ more deserving, more talented and more capable than those who don\u2019t?\r\
      \n\r\n\r\nDo you feel good about that statement?\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you tweet\
      \ it?\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you post it on Facebook?\r\n\r\n\r\nI want entrepreneurs\
      \ \u2013 the people who are in the unique position of being able to challenge\
      \ existing business models, create jobs, generate new products, systems and\
      \ ideas \u2013 to consider that the culture of denigrating those who have less\
      \ in favor of those who have more is a toxic one, and numbs us to the huge,\
      \ systemic problems that exist in the world in favor of an idealized version\
      \ of reality where people who are worth your time and energy are the ones who\
      \ can pay you the most.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not saying to stop selling $2000\
      \ products.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not saying to stop charging rates for your work\
      \ and time that allow you to support yourself and continue your business.\r\n\
      \r\nI\u2019m not saying you should start giving away everything for free.\r\n\
      \r\n\r\nBut I am asking you to stop talking about people who have less as if\
      \ they are less valuable than people who have more, and start thinking, seriously,\
      \ about how you measure value.\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage matters. The words we use\
      \ to talk about things influence how we feel about them \u2013 and the more\
      \ we talk about people who don\u2019t have a lot of money as if they\u2019re\
      \ not worth our time, the less likely we are to question the way things are\
      \ done now \u2013 and explore NEW ideas about how things CAN be done.\r\n\r\n\
      \r\nHit reply and let me know what you think.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMegan Dougherty\r\

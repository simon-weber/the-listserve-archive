<p>1. Watch for bikers and runners when you drive.  Too many accidents occur because people are making a simple turn and are in a hurry, and forget to look to see who else they share the road with.  If you see a biker or runner, don't forget to check where they are before you turn in front of them, otherwise you could turn right in front of them and badly injure someone (not to mention put a nasty dent in your car).</p>
<p>2. Don't drink and drive. It doesn't matter if you've only had two drinks.  If you think you're okay to drive, wait a half hour to be sure.  The next time you think about getting into a car, think about if you found out when you got home that your son/daughter/brother/sister/best friend was killed by a drunk driver.  Just don't risk it.</p>
<p>3. Help others.  One of my favorite quotes is by Shirley Chisholm: "Service to others is the rent we pay for our room here on earth."  It doesn't matter who you are or how hard you've worked to get where you are, someone out there has fewer opportunities than you.  Everyone has someone else to thank for where they have gotten in life: your parents for raising you in a good environment and working to give you a college degree or good values, a teacher or mentor who helped you realize your passion, a nameless patron who donated scholarship money or gave you a job.  But not everyone receives the same opportunities, and everyone at least deserves to be fed, to be educated, to have a roof over their head.  It may seem that one person can not make a change, but one person can be a friend or make a small difference in one other person's life, and that's all that matters.</p>
<p>4. Send a card or letter to someone you care about, just to let them know they matter and you are thinking about them.  Not tomorrow, do it today.  Tomorrow might be too late.</p>

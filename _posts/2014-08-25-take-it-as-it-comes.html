      <p>I have the same trouble most people express on here. What profundity (that
      had better be a word..) do I have worthy of this list?<br />My initial thought
      was absolutely none. I am a boring, middle 30''s, white, middle class guy living
      in suburban USA. What could I possibly have to share?</p>

      <p>I guess I have lived a bit more interesting life than most people. I am originally
      from rural New Zealand; lived briefly in Australia (stint in Sydney; shorter
      time in Brisbane -  I would love to move back if I could); moved to the US where

      humid, miserable (but winter kicks arse) north eastern Florida.</p>

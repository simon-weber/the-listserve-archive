    body: "I trekked through the snow for what felt like hours. My clothes were doing\
      \ nothing against the gusts of wind beating against my body. Felt like it wouldn\u2019\
      t be long before I pass out and freeze. Soon I could walk no more and fell to\
      \ me knees. I couldn\u2019t feel my arms or legs and was certain all hope was\
      \ lost.\r\n\r\nThen I smelled it. Queso and beans filled the air around me.\
      \ I was nowhere near civilization so where could it be coming from? Next I smelled\
      \ guacamole, and then sour cream. Somehow the smell was getting closer.\r\n\r\
      \nAnd that is when I saw a figure through the falling snow.\r\n\r\n\u201CWho\u2019\
      s there?\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was hard to see all of him at first. With each footstep\
      \ his spurs made a clinking sound. The bright red bandana was hard to miss,\
      \ and then his mustache and brows. His full shape then came into view and he\
      \ paused.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhat...what are you?\u201D\r\n\r\nHe was a tall wrapped\
      \ tortilla. His hands rested on the holsters of his pistoles. And his sombrero\
      \ was larger than I am. It was El Bandito Burrito.\r\n\r\nI was scared when\
      \ he took a step towards me but I could not move. I don\u2019t know if it was\
      \ the cold wind or his incredible gaze that struck me still. All I know is I\
      \ didn\u2019t budge from being on my knees.\r\n\r\nNot a word was spoken as\
      \ he came in close and wrapped his arms around me.  My cheeks felt his tortilla\
      \ caliente. Even in the freezing cold his body could not chill. A tear escaped\
      \ my eyes knowing I was warm and safe.\r\n\r\nTaking off his sombrero he wrapped\
      \ it around me. The thing somehow covered my entire body. And out from his head\
      \ even more warmth spread.\r\n\r\n\u201CTh-thank you.\u201D\r\n\r\nFeeling was\
      \ returning to my arms and legs. I wondered if I should try to run, but then\
      \ I wondered why bother? How far would I get before I lose feeling again? All\
      \ that mattered is I was safe and alive. Who cares if it was a burrito who saved\
      \ me? There in his arms, I fell asleep.\r\n\r\nNext morning I woke up and the\
      \ sun was out. The shining warmth filled me with joy and I leaped to my feet\
      \ in excitement. I looked around and saw I was alone. El Bandito Burrito had\
      \ stayed with me through la noche and disappeared.\r\n\r\n\u201CGRACIAS!!!\u201D\
      \r\n\r\nI know not if he was anywhere close enough to hear me. Still I had to\
      \ try. I never saw him again to express my thanks. And that is my story of how\
      \ I was saved by El Bandito Burrito.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\
      \n\r\nI\u2019ve been doing a lot of writing this past year. Mostly I write romance\
      \ short stories, and about a month ago I started writing these quick little\
      \ mini stories of El Bandito Burrito - fun, ridiculous legends of a character\
      \ I made up. When I won The Listserve I decided to write a brand new one just\
      \ for here.\r\n\r\nNow I did recently launch a Kickstarter for writing more\
      \ mini stories with El Bandito Burrito; mostly as a fun way for others to give\
      \ me ideas as part of an anthology I\u2019m going to publish with 50 stories.\
      \ I haven\u2019t decided if I\u2019ll include the one above. It might be fun\
      \ to keep it a Listserve exclusive.\r\n\r\nHopefully you enjoyed it.\r\n\r\n\

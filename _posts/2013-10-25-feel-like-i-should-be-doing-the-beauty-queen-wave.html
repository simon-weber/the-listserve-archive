    \ moved for family. I love ice cream which is not too suprising considering Seattle\
    \ and Portland are both in the top five for the consumption of it. \r\nGoing to\
    \ be an aunt in April and can't wait to meet a nephew named after Game of Thrones;\
    \ now I will have to watch the show.   \r\nI often feel like nothing important\
    \ or exciting happens that is worth mentioning but life really is about that perfect\
    \ cup of coffee or a good moment and not all about the big things.\r\nMy best\
    \ friend Erin and I are making bitters for the first time. Giving it a go but\
    \ anyone have a great recipe? \r\nBack to the ice cream. As I hate eggs, anyone\
    \ have an eggless ice cream recipe they would reccomend? \r\nBy baby brother introduced\
    \ me to football and now I love it. A big reason I love the game is how it helped\
    \ connect me to a brother fourteen years younger than me. This season I'm playing\

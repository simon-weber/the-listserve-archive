<p>You have something you always wanted to learn to do, but <br />never did.  Perhaps you were intimidated; maybe you didn't<br />know where to start.  Maybe you tried, but got frustrated.  <br />Maybe you had grand plans that would have taken you years of <br />concentrated effort to pull off.</p>
<p>Here is a thing that I am learning: It's okay to do it badly.</p>
<p>So your stick figures aren't even recognizable as people.  <br />So you knit a rectangular scarf that's somehow not a <br />rectangle.  So the birdhouse you built is wonky.  So the <br />program you wrote crashes if you look at it funny.  So you <br />painted an ugly picture of your father in his underwear in <br />a recliner.  So the curtains you sewed sit funny on the rod.  <br />So you only know two chords on the guitar, and it takes you <br />a few seconds to switch between them.  So you made a video-<br />game that's ugly and weird and broken and nobody wants to <br />play.</p>
<p>Do something that you're bad at.  Enjoy it anyway.</p>
<p>Maybe get good at it, if you want.</p>
<p>But you've gotta do it badly first.</p>

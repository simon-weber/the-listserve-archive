      get a little of that, as well.</p>

      <p>First, a snapshot of my life: Like for many of you, the &#8220;You''ve won
      The Listserve!&#8221; email came at a difficult time for me. I&#8217;m a new
      physician slogging through intern year in internal medicine, which has been
      more draining than I could have imagined. I was never one of those people who
      knew that she wanted to be a doctor since age 5 (I decided to go into medicine
      during my last year of college) but I never had second thoughts about it until
      the past few months. Here&#8217;s hoping that changes. I was recently diagnosed
      with (a fortunately very curable type of) cancer, and having seen what goes
      on in operating rooms has left me very nervous about my upcoming surgery. On
      top of that, I just ended a significant relationship of 4 years with someone
      whom I love very much. Sometimes you just really really really want John Lennon
      to be right, but alas.</p>

      <p>And now for a favorite quote: "What keeps you going isn''t some fine destination
      but just the road you''re on, and the fact that you know how to drive."<br />-Barbara
      Kingsolver, from Animal Dreams</p>

      <p>And some recommendations off the top of my head:</p>

      <p>Life-changing (or just awesome) books:<br />Middlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides<br
      />The Color Purple by Alice Walker<br />The Once and Future King by T.H. White<br
      />A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini<br />Ready Player One by Ernest
      Cline (okay so definitely not life-changing, but I just finished it and absolutely
      loved it)</p>

      <p>Delicious delicious food places:<br />La Caba&#241;a in Venice, CA<br />The
      Nom Nom Truck, around Los Angeles<br />Glazed and Infused in Chicago<br />M&#225;s
      in Charlottesville, VA<br />Chandler&#8217;s Deli in Knoxville, TN</p>

      <p>And beer, wonderful beer:<br />Breckenridge 471 IPA<br />Victory Storm King<br
      />Dogfish Head Raison D''Etre</p>

      <p>And finally, a poem I wrote for a friend who died too young:</p>

      <p>you were not in that box.<br />i felt the flames and saw the heat<br />shimmer
      away<br />out of that pipe and into the sky,<br />but you weren&#8217;t there.</p>

      <p>you were in the tears and the laughter and the stories,<br />you were in

      the hearts of your family and of us, your friends.<br />you were.<br />you are.</p>

      <p>---<br />I am not the best email-responder, but tips for surviving intern
      year (and residency in general), and for moving on, are always welcome.</p>

      <p>Be well.</p>

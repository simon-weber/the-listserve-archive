    \     Story by Rikki Udagawa, Words by Peter Fellows\r\n\r\nA curious young girl,\
    \ Ponda often felt, she was being followed by something else. A darker presence,\
    \ in the corner of her eye, a crooked hand reaching out, but just out of sight.\r\
    \nOne winter noon, she ventured, down a dusty road, where she met a withered old\
    \ man who sensed her forebode. With crusty eyes and wrinkled mouth, he frowned\
    \ as she described the dark presence, following her around. She didn\u2019t bear\
    \ to face what might be there, just too frightened to turn and face its glare.\r\
    \nWith a smile he sighed, and said \u2018Although you\u2019re afraid, my dear,\
    \ you must face up to this presence, and recognize your fear. Life must go on\u2019\
    . Considering his wise words, Ponda thanked him and travelled on. Before long,\
    \ she felt it there, sneaking up behind her, breathing in her hair. With terrified\
    \ eyes, Ponda turned with all her strength, saw grimy fingers appear from nowhere,\
    \ snatching at her, taunting her, binding together; a body appeared from the depths,\
    \ a cloaked figure, the one called \u2018Death!\u2019\r\nPonda couldn\u2019t believe\
    \ her eyes. She wanted to scream, but tears were all she could find. She begged\
    \ for more time, promising any life mistakes would be set right.\r\nGently taking\
    \ her hand in his, she felt all fear simultaneously dismiss. With tender voice,\
    \ and wanting tone, he told her \u2018I\u2019m just tired of being alone. I\u2019\
    ve fallen in love with you Ponda, and I wanted you to know. Your commitment to\
    \ me would mean a life in darkness. I\u2019d care and love you. We\u2019d be eternity\u2019\
    s partners. You\u2019d sit upon life\u2019s throne\u2019.\r\nRecognising loneliness,\
    \ Ponda promised that she would. But not until she\u2019d reached a ripe old age,\
    \ and lived her life as she should.\r\nPromising to leave her, until that fateful\
    \ day, Death let go of her hand, and disappeared from whence he came.\r\nSeveral\
    \ years passed quickly, for Ponda now felt safe. She no longer felt the presence,\
    \ the fear of being chased. Until, one morning she entered, a forest ripe with\
    \ growth, where she once again felt tingling, and knew she\u2019d been followed.\r\
    \nTurning, no fear present, she witnessed death\u2019s gritty hands, reach around\
    \ her shoulders, and pull her to the ground. Her soul was released to the air,\
    \ from beneath the woodland soil, Death grasping her body close, no remnants to\
    \ tell her toil.\r\nPerhaps death was angry, or his love was just so strong, he\
    \ couldn\u2019t bear for them to be apart, not for so long. Or possibly, her time\
    \ to die, had finally arrived for Ponda. It\u2019ll never be known, which is the\
    \ truth, and that is something to ponder\u2026\r\n\r\n                       \
    \ The End.\r\n\r\n                        Thank you.\r\n\r\n\r\nRikki Udagawa\t\

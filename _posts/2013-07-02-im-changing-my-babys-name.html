  body: "I need your help. I\u2019m changing my baby\u2019s name, which it has had\
    \ for four years.\r\n\r\nI should clarify that my baby is not a human baby, but\
    \ rather a company that I own. Right now, my baby is called Fresh Prints. We make\
    \ custom-design apparel. I\u2019m a senior in college, and all 40 people that\
    \ I work with are also college students. I\u2019ve spent my entire college career\
    \ living and breathing this company. Unfortunately, for complicated trademark\
    \ reasons, multiple lawyers have told us that we need to change our company name.\r\
    \n\r\nThe past year has shown me that the Listserve community is filled with smart,\
    \ funny and diverse people. I can\u2019t imagine a better group of people to rely\
    \ on when I need to make such an important decision. So, I\u2019m asking for your\
    \ help in 2 ways:\r\n\r\n1) Send me ideas for a new name! We want a name that\
    \ is clever, easy to pronounce and indicates what we do. Here's what you need\
    \ to know about us: we're all college students, our top-notch graphic designers\
    \ provide clients with free professional designs and we will do anything for our\
    \ customers. We make ordering custom apparel really, really easy. We make really\
    \ awesome t-shirts, hoodies, aprons, pretty much anything!\r\n\r\nI\u2019ll post\
    \ the suggestions we get on our facebook page for everyone to comment on. (just\
    \ search Fresh Prints on Facebook).\r\n\r\n2) Use [insert new company name] to\
    \ make awesome clothing! I love working with people to make awesome apparel and\
    \ I'd love to meet fellow listervers, so if you ever ever want some custom apparel,\
    \ send me an email! Mention that you're from the listserve so I can personally\
    \ give you some special treatment and a discount :)\r\n\r\nMy last request is\
    \ that you help grow the listserve. When I joined over a year ago, there were\
    \ ~21,000 people, and we\u2019re only at 23,000 now. If we all get three or four\
    \ friends to join, there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t pass 100,000 people in\
    \ the next two weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. If you like technology, laughing or cleverness,\
    \ follow my friend Aaron Wilson on Twitter (@aarowilso)\r\n\r\nP.P.S. One of my\
    \ more cynical friends suggested that I make the subject line on this email \u201C\
    You\u2019ve won the Listserve.\u201D Because that\u2019s one of the crueler things\
    \ I can think of, I hope I just ruined that joke for any future, heartless listserver\

<p>I&#8217;d like to draw your attention to Bhutan, a unique nation bordering India and China. Although it is considered to be a developing country, I think the Bhutanese are in fact leading the rest of us in a fundamental area: Their national goal of, not Gross National Product, but rather Gross National Happiness. That&#8217;s right, it&#8217;s a real thing &#8211; an entire nation of people who collectively concern themselves with attaining happiness rather than money. Awesome.</p>
<p>Inspired by their ideals, I try to take time daily out of my busy Canadian life to do simple things that make me smile:</p>
<p>-Read the comics every morning</p>
<p>-Participate in the art of people-watching and delight in those who break the mold (this weekend I met a priest who rides a motorcycle!)</p>
<p>-Sing in the car on the way to work &#8211; LOUD &#8211; even when I&#8217;m way off key and the only thing on is Carly Rae Jepsen or One Direction.</p>
<p>-Smile &#8211; really smile &#8211; at strangers on the street. It&#8217;s incredible how contagious a smile can be; it&#8217;s almost always reciprocated.</p>
<p>So today, I ask you to do one simple thing that makes you smile. Wear your best underwear; Listen to your favourite song; Call an old friend; Bake some cupcakes; Learn a joke.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope I&#8217;ve given you reason to smile, or at least made you think about it.  Please feel free to contact me - I&#8217;d love to hear what you did today in pursuit of happiness!</p>
<p>Sending you a smile,</p>

      said whatever you want to say better than you have... so I''ll leave you all
      with my favorite poem.</p>

      <p>On Children -- Kahlil Gibran <br />Your children are not your children.<br
      />They are the sons and daughters of Life''s longing for itself.<br />They come
      through you but not from you,<br />And though they are with you yet they belong
      not to you.</p>

      <p>You may give them your love but not your thoughts, <br />For they have their
      own thoughts.<br />You may house their bodies but not their souls,<br />For
      their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, <br />which you cannot visit, not
      even in your dreams.<br />You may strive to be like them, <br />but seek not
      to make them like you.<br />For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.</p>

      <p>You are the bows from which your children<br />as living arrows are sent
      forth.<br />The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, <br />and
      He bends you with His might <br />that His arrows may go swift and far.<br />Let
      your bending in the archer''s hand be for gladness;<br />For even as He loves
      the arrow that flies, <br />so He loves also the bow that is stable.</p>

      <p>As an extremely side note (since the prospect of emailing tens of thousands
      of people doesn''t come everyday): one of my biggest passions is sports analytics,
      mostly with the NBA or the NFL. If you or someone you know is doing interesting
      work, I would love to hear about it and collaborate! Email me @ listerohan@gmail.com.</p>

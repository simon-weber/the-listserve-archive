    body: "Both a Muslim prayer rug and a Jewish prayer shawl are essentially rectangles\
      \ of cloth. It is this material connection that first piqued my interest. How\
      \ does a cloth rectangle become a ritual object? At which moment in the arc\
      \ from being made to being used for a specific practice do these cloths become\
      \ vessels for magic or \u2018the sacred\u2019? What makes a rug a rug and a\
      \ shawl a shawl? Could one cloth rectangle be activated for both purposes? When\
      \ would it need to break apart in order to retain its ritual integrity?\r\n\r\
      \nIn the months leading up to and following the 2016 presidential election,\
      \ and into  2018, I began weaving, performing, and exhibiting a \u201Chybrid\
      \ ritual object,\u201D an ethereal sixteen-foot cloth that I display partially\
      \ on the ground and partially suspended. One end is a \"shawl\", and the other\
      \ end is a \"rug\", and the midsection is about five feet of unwoven warp threads.\
      \ When you picture what I lovingly call my absurd interfaith ritual object,\
      \ imagine two similar yet distinct cloth rectangles connected by a billowing\
      \ mass of loose strings. Or, imagine one long cloth that is solid at either\
      \ end, with a long suspended portion in the middle. This section is the \u201C\
      no-cloth,\u201D the ritual yet unwoven, the breathing room in between our two\
      \ traditions to do our own thing, to act or to rest, alone or together.\r\n\r\
      \nWhy did I need to make this hybrid ritual object after Standing Rock, and\
      \ the election, and the anti-Muslim travel ban? Growing up in New York State\
      \ following 9/11, starting an afterschool Muslim-Jewish dialogue group was a\
      \ (limited, at times superficial, at times connective) way to push against the\
      \ Islamophobic propaganda on the news and the murmurs in the halls. Fifteen\
      \ years later, collaborating with artists, scholars, and community members through\
      \ the Muslim Jewish Arts Fellowship (google us and check out our wordpress blog!)\
      \ around Biblical and Qur\u2019anic texts, poetics, and art, the shared practice\
      \ is specific, and the relationships feel clearer. Amid the acrid escalation\
      \ of anti-refugee, anti-immigrant, and anti-Muslim oppression, celebrating and\
      \ maintaining our distinct practices on the one hand and coming together to\
      \ create new shard rituals on the other feels like calisthenics for just citizenship.\r\
      \n\r\nMy painting practice regularly teaches me about limits. A canvas is limited\

      \ everything. How far can you push painting until it breaks?\u201D Her question\
      \ cues me to pay attention to thresholds: how much force can I apply to this\
      \ linen thread in my weaving before it breaks? How much weight can it bear?\
      \ How can I learn about its strength in this way? A big part of both interfaith\
      \ text study and art practice, as in other relationships committed to lovingly\

      \nI'm a 27 year old male musician/percussionist in MA. I hit marimbas with four\
      \ sticks. Right now I teach elementary music, but I'm working on going back\
      \ to school to get my masters degree... and maybe eventually a PhD to become\
      \ a Percussion Professor. Right now, that's the plan. But plans can change,\
      \ right?\r\n\r\nI teach high school music ensembles after school, and late at\
      \ night I write music. This is what I love the most, the writing. I've always\
      \ loved writing, even before I wrote music I loved writing- words, that is.\
      \ Maybe my plan will change and I'll write music for a living somehow... I dunno.\
      \ Leave all doors open, I always told myself.\r\n\r\n__________\r\n\r\nI believe\
      \ love is a choice. (Maybe a great first blog subject?)\r\nI do not believe\
      \ in soul mates.\r\nI believe that I wake up every day and make the choice to\
      \ stay with her. I have yet to regret it, hence the seven year mark.\r\nI do\
      \ not think I ever will regret it.\r\nI believe I'm lucky for feeling strongly\
      \ about this.\r\nBut I do not believe that there is a rush to get married or\
      \ procreate. These things will come with time, and I am young, and I have things\
      \ to do before I \"settle down\" in this manner. Right now, I have her, and\
      \ my loving family, and a strong network of supportive friends, and ambition.\
      \ That is enough, for now.\r\n\r\n__________\r\n\r\nI believe there is a certain\
      \ level of responsibility that comes with being lucky. That being provided certain\
      \ opportunities and a certain station in life, it is my duty to take advantage\
      \ of the world around me; to own my station and live a full life if I can. \r\
      \n\r\nYes, I feel that I have the responsibility to help those in need, simply\
      \ because I have the power. But I am a coward. I make small gestures here and\
      \ there... a few donations, spotting the homeless some crackers on my way home\
      \ from work when they walk past my car.... but I am afraid to do more. To sacrifice\
      \ personal comfort. \r\n\r\nThis keeps me up at night.\r\n\r\n__________\r\n\
      \r\nI dropped a penny from the Eiffel Tower when I was in 7th grade. My 13 year\

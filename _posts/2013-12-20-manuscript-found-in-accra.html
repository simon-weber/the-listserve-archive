      \ is causing our fear.\r\n\r\nThis is so from childhood onward, until we reach\r\
      \n\r\nthe age when we become indifferent to life. Because\r\n\r\nas long as\
      \ we are intensely connected to the present\r\n\r\nmoment, we will always be\

      \ you tell a passionate heart to be still and to\r\n\r\ncontemplate the miracles\
      \ of Creation in silence, free of\r\n\r\ntension, fear, and unanswerable questions?\r\
      \n\r\nAnxiety is part of love, and should not be blamed\r\n\r\nbecause of that.\r\
      \n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can you tell someone not to worry when he has\r\n\r\ninvested\
      \ his money and his life in a dream but has yet to\r\n\r\nsee any results? The\
      \ farmer cannot speed the progress\r\n\r\nof the seasons in order to pick the\
      \ fruit he planted, but\r\n\r\nhe waits impatiently for the coming of autumn\
      \ and harvest\r\n\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can you ask a warrior not to feel\
      \ anxious before\r\n\r\na battle? He has trained to the point of exhaustion\
      \ for this\r\n\r\nmoment; he has given of his best. While he believes he\r\n\
      \r\nis prepared, he fears that all his efforts could prove to be\r\n\r\nin vain.\r\
      \n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnxiety was born in the very same moment as mankind.\r\n\r\nAnd\
      \ since we will never be able to master it, we\r\n\r\nwill have to learn to\
      \ live with it\u2014just as we have learned\r\n\r\nto live with storms.\r\n\r\
      \n\r\n\r\nFor those who cannot learn to do so, life will be a\r\n\r\nnightmare.\
      \ Even worse, in an attempt to drive away anxiety,\r\n\r\nthey do things that\

      <p>There is nothing wrong with anxiety.</p>

      <p>Although we cannot control God&#8217;s time, it&#8217;s part of the human
      condition to want to receive the thing we are waiting for as quickly as possible.</p>

      <p>Or to drive away whatever is causing our fear.</p>

      <p>Anxiety is part of love, and should not be blamed</p>

      <p>because of that.</p>

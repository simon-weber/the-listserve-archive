      \r\nAbout 30 of us stood lined up, shoulder to shoulder, all in khaki pants\

      \ \_The second time was louder. \_In his perfectly sculpted attire, he looked\

      \n\r\nWe clumsily shuffled into push-up position, hugging the ground.\r\n\r\n\
      \"Begin!\" he yelled.\r\n\r\nWe began doing push-ups. \_\"Sir, one sir! \_Sir,\

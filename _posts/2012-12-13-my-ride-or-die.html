<p>My mother always wanted me to write about her for those radio show contests. She stopped asking but I never did it. I felt the public recognition wasn&#8217;t necessary. She&#8217;s my best friend, the one who keeps me going when I can&#8217;t motivate myself. I love her to death and don&#8217;t know where I would be without her.</p>
<p>She became a single mother when my dad was killed. I was a baby. She didn&#8217;t crumble but fought back. My family&#8217;s life hasn&#8217;t been easy but she&#8217;s managed to put me through an Ivy League University and support me in my current quest of attending medical school.</p>
<p>I realize now that I should have entered her in some of those contests. Sometimes, private recognition isn&#8217;t enough. So, here it is &#8211; her recognition. This isn&#8217;t a contest and she&#8217;s not going to win a prize but you knowing is enough.</p>
<p>Do me a favor; drop a note to the email address, stating that you heard about her story and what it means to you.</p>

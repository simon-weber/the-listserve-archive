    \ She stopped asking but I never did it. I felt the public recognition wasn\u2019\

    t motivate myself. I love her to death and don\u2019t know where I would be without\
    \ her.\r\n\r\nShe became a single mother when my dad was killed. I was a baby.\
    \ She didn\u2019t crumble but fought back. My family\u2019s life hasn\u2019t been\
    \ easy but she\u2019s managed to put me through an Ivy League University and support\
    \ me in my current quest of attending medical school.\r\n\r\nI realize now that\
    \ I should have entered her in some of those contests. Sometimes, private recognition\
    \ isn\u2019t enough. So, here it is \u2013 her recognition. This isn\u2019t a\
    \ contest and she\u2019s not going to win a prize but you knowing is enough.\r\

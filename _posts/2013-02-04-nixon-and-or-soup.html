  body: "Dear all you people:\r\n\r\nDo any of you happen to own, or know somebody\
    \ who owns, a print of Philippe Halsman's 1955 photograph of Richard Nixon jumping?\r\
    \n\r\nIf so, I would like to buy that print from you, or from that person you\
    \ know.\r\n\r\nFrankly, if you have any cool Nixon swag, email me.  (Nixon is\
    \ fascinating to me because he proved that being enormously powerful and being\
    \ a cripplingly emotionally-flawed person are not mutually exclusive.)\r\n\r\n\
    I realize that using this platform to hunt for political collectibles is an arguably\
    \ selfish act.  And I don't have any meaningful life advice to offer total strangers.\
    \  I don't know any of you people.  Maybe you shouldn't be reaching for the stars.\
    \  Who knows?  It's not really any of my business anyway.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps you'll\
    \ be less mad at me for wasting your time and dismissing well-intentioned affirmations\
    \ after you've had some soup.  (Based, I admit with some shame, on an Emeril Lagasse\
    \ recipe.)\r\n\r\n1. Heat some olive oil in a big pot.  Chop the following: 1\
    \ large white onion, 4 ribs celery, 4 carrots, 1 poblano pepper, 1 yellow bell\
    \ pepper.  Put it all in the pot and stir it around until it looks different.\r\
    \n\r\n2. Mince a ton of garlic and a jalapeno pepper.  Leave the damn seeds in.\
    \  Don\u2019t be difficult.  In fact, just for getting all wimpy, make it two\
    \ jalapenos.  Add all that to the pot.\r\n\r\n3. Add some dried oregano, some\
    \ cumin, some chili powder.  Also mince a couple of canned chipotles and add those,\
    \ along with a spoonful of the adobo they came canned in.  And then a 14 oz can\
    \ of diced tomatoes.  Stir it around your kitchen smells good.  Maybe you have\
    \ a bay leaf lying around?  Throw that in.\r\n\r\n4. Add a shrink-wrapped package's\
    \ worth of big, quivering, factory-farmed, lazy American boneless skinless chicken\
    \ breasts and 64 oz chicken stock.  Yes, by all means, use your homemade artisanal\
    \ stock.  Good for you.  Bring to a boil, reduce to simmer, let it cook until\
    \ the chicken\u2019s cooked through.\r\n\r\n5. Get the chicken out, let it cool,\
    \ shred it, and put it back in the pot with an unreasonable amount of lime juice.\
    \  Like a third of a cup.  By which I mean a half cup.  Oh, and a bunch of chopped\
    \ scallions.\r\n\r\n6. Serve with a handful of Tostitos Hint of Lime (yes, the\
    \ brand matters \u2013 these have some kind of weird fake sour cream powder on\
    \ them, and as the chips soften and dissolve, the soup gets a little creamy) and\
    \ some cilantro.\r\n\r\n7. Eat the soup.  Do not photograph it.  Do not Tweet\
    \ about it.  Do not use it as a metaphor for the lessons you\u2019ve learned in\
    \ your 23 years on this crazy planet including a whole eight months in Peru where\
    \ you totally found yourself.  Just eat the soup.  And let me know if you have\
    \ a line on any Nixon stuff.\r\n\r\n-- Andy\r\nandybarr@gmail.com\t\r\nWashington,\

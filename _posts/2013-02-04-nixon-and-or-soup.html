<p>Dear all you people:</p>
<p>Do any of you happen to own, or know somebody who owns, a print of Philippe Halsman's 1955 photograph of Richard Nixon jumping?</p>
<p>If so, I would like to buy that print from you, or from that person you know.</p>
<p>Frankly, if you have any cool Nixon swag, email me.  (Nixon is fascinating to me because he proved that being enormously powerful and being a cripplingly emotionally-flawed person are not mutually exclusive.)</p>
<p>I realize that using this platform to hunt for political collectibles is an arguably selfish act.  And I don't have any meaningful life advice to offer total strangers.  I don't know any of you people.  Maybe you shouldn't be reaching for the stars.  Who knows?  It's not really any of my business anyway.</p>
<p>But perhaps you'll be less mad at me for wasting your time and dismissing well-intentioned affirmations after you've had some soup.  (Based, I admit with some shame, on an Emeril Lagasse recipe.)</p>
<p>1. Heat some olive oil in a big pot.  Chop the following: 1 large white onion, 4 ribs celery, 4 carrots, 1 poblano pepper, 1 yellow bell pepper.  Put it all in the pot and stir it around until it looks different.</p>
<p>2. Mince a ton of garlic and a jalapeno pepper.  Leave the damn seeds in.  Don&#8217;t be difficult.  In fact, just for getting all wimpy, make it two jalapenos.  Add all that to the pot.</p>
<p>3. Add some dried oregano, some cumin, some chili powder.  Also mince a couple of canned chipotles and add those, along with a spoonful of the adobo they came canned in.  And then a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes.  Stir it around your kitchen smells good.  Maybe you have a bay leaf lying around?  Throw that in.</p>
<p>4. Add a shrink-wrapped package's worth of big, quivering, factory-farmed, lazy American boneless skinless chicken breasts and 64 oz chicken stock.  Yes, by all means, use your homemade artisanal stock.  Good for you.  Bring to a boil, reduce to simmer, let it cook until the chicken&#8217;s cooked through.</p>
<p>5. Get the chicken out, let it cool, shred it, and put it back in the pot with an unreasonable amount of lime juice.  Like a third of a cup.  By which I mean a half cup.  Oh, and a bunch of chopped scallions.</p>
<p>6. Serve with a handful of Tostitos Hint of Lime (yes, the brand matters &#8211; these have some kind of weird fake sour cream powder on them, and as the chips soften and dissolve, the soup gets a little creamy) and some cilantro.</p>
<p>7. Eat the soup.  Do not photograph it.  Do not Tweet about it.  Do not use it as a metaphor for the lessons you&#8217;ve learned in your 23 years on this crazy planet including a whole eight months in Peru where you totally found yourself.  Just eat the soup.  And let me know if you have a line on any Nixon stuff.</p>

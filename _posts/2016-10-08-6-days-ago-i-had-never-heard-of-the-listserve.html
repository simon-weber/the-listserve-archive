      \ gods knew that today was special, and picked me as \u201Cwinner\u201D of the\
      \ day.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m totally unworthy of this.  I\u2019ve paid no \u201Cdues\u201D\
      .  I\u2019m sure most of you have been signed up for years, waiting to be picked.\
      \  With the exception of my brother\u2019s contribution, I\u2019ve never even\

      \n\r\nTwice a week, I commute from my home in Baltimore, Maryland to Arlington.\

      \ like to make up a game to keep my mind occupied.  Six months ago, I invented\
      \ a game called \u201CThink of 10 Songs that have a person\u2019s name in the\
      \ song title.  The person\u2019s name has to start with the letter \u201CA\u201D\
      .  No duplicate artists.  Rank them in favorite order\u201D.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019\
      s what I came up with for \u201CA\u201D:\r\n\r\n1) Andrew in Drag - The Magnetic\

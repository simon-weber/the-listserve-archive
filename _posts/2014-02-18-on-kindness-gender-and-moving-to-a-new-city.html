    body: "Hello, world.\r\n\r\nMy name is Valerie. I'm 19 years old and I live in\
      \ Ottawa, Canada, but I'm moving to Montr\xE9al this summer for school. I work\
      \ as a cashier at a grocery store. I am a transgender woman. I like good tea\
      \ and bad coffee. I like waking up slowly to bright skies and frost on my window.\
      \ I like warm summer nights spent with friends that go on and on, until everyone\
      \ starts to feel dawn approaching and gets very candid, as if the sun might\
      \ just not come up again. I like getting lost in cities I've never been to before\
      \ - or places I thought I knew like the back of my hand until I met someone\
      \ with a different map.\r\n\r\nThere's a couple of things I want to ask you\
      \ to do, followed by questions.\r\n\r\nFirst off I want to implore you to be\
      \ kind to the people who serve you - your waiters, your dry-cleaners, maybe\
      \ even your grocery store cashier. We know you're having a bad day. We've met\
      \ a hundred people today who are having a bad day. Your frustrating ten minutes\
      \ in line is my eight-hour workday. Practical suggestion: if you had to wait\
      \ in line a long time, try helping bag your groceries if you can. I'm going\
      \ to have to deal with that long line all day, but your two minutes' work just\
      \ saved each person in line two minutes. In general, be proactive about making\
      \ life slightly easier for the people around you, and you'll start to notice\
      \ when people do the same for you.\r\n\r\nSecond, I want to elaborate on an\
      \ earlier part of my introduction. As I said, I'm transgender. In the last couple\
      \ of months I've come out to nearly everybody I know, including coworkers and\
      \ the general public. For some reason I always expected that the most difficult\
      \ part would be the few horrible people who actively hate me or believe that\
      \ my gender is illegitimate. I actually haven't met very many of those people\
      \ at all, thankfully. But what really makes my day difficult isn't the people\
      \ who want nothing to do with me but the people who just don't notice or care\
      \ that I'm not a man. Please, look at the person in front of you. Look at their\
      \ nametag, what they're wearing, the impression they are trying to make on you.\
      \ Someone in a dress and makeup, even if she has a deep voice, is probably trying\
      \ to convey to you how she'd like to be seen and treated. You don't have to\
      \ (please don't) make a big deal out of it. Just, try 'miss' instead of 'bro'.\
      \ I know I'm the first trans person you've spoken to this week, or in your life.\
      \ I know it's difficult. But you're the hundredth person I've spoken to today\
      \ who's in your shoes. I've been told how difficult I am to see as I am ten\
      \ times today.\r\n\r\nLastly: I am in need of advice myself. If you've moved\
      \ to Qu\xE9bec from out of the province before, I'd love your wisdom on that\
      \ process. If you live in Montr\xE9al, what is there to do and see and eat?\
      \ Do you have advice on (re)learning French? What jobs are there for students\
      \ with a tenuous grasp of the language? How do I avoid pissing off Montr\xE9\

    body: '<p>Hello, world.</p>

      <p>My name is Valerie. I''m 19 years old and I live in Ottawa, Canada, but I''m
      moving to Montr&#233;al this summer for school. I work as a cashier at a grocery
      store. I am a transgender woman. I like good tea and bad coffee. I like waking

      <p>There''s a couple of things I want to ask you to do, followed by questions.</p>

      <p>First off I want to implore you to be kind to the people who serve you -
      your waiters, your dry-cleaners, maybe even your grocery store cashier. We know
      you''re having a bad day. We''ve met a hundred people today who are having a

      <p>It is a perverse moment during international conflicts when domestic structures
      are disassembled for a state&#8217;s own munitions. The year 1789 witnessed
      the melting of the bells of Notre Dame to make cannon. After the 1939 World&#8217;s
      Fair in New York, the iconic Trylon and Perisphere were deconstructed for the
      production of WWII armaments. Endless quantities of architectural ornamentation
      across the Allied Powers were removed in the 1940&#8217;s for war efforts. These
      acts embody such a simple twist: take a stand by taking something that stands.
      It is as if the built manifestation of a people&#8217;s ideals transform into
      invisible artillery for the preservation of its underlying ideologies -- as
      if the crystallized structures have all along been peaceful arms preserving
      an identity against other cultures.</p>

      <p>I like to study how our environment tells stories about not only its inhabitants,
      but its creators, its viewers, and its inheritors. I believe the permanence
      and slow pace of building holds a mirror to the rapid and continuous unfolding
      of our current affairs. Never static, our built environment continuously changes

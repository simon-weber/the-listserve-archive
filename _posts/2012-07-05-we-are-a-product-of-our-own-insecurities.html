<p>Don&#8217;t worry, this won&#8217;t be one of those love yourself emails&#8230;although you should be doing that already.  I would like introduce myself as Mr. Realist.  I am not particularly religious, I just believe in things I see.  I believe in capitalism and have encountered enough people to see that most people act in their own self-interest.  I am not a hater or a pessimist; again, I am just a realist.</p>
<p>So how did I get this way?  I am not sure.  There are so many questions, yet so little time to find the answers.  I don&#8217;t understand many things but I am intensely curious.  Many people I come across rather know nothing and be happy rather than to know everything and be slightly bitter.  It is hard for me to understand this but as always, I respect the viewpoint.  Why not try to understand the world for all its intricacies?</p>
<p>I love life.  I am privileged to work and live in a very progressive environment.  It is mind bending to think how far we have come as a society in such short period of time.  We are tolerant and accepting as a majority, but then again, I live in a bubble.  Individuality is ripping from the seams of conformity.  We are breaking into our own unique mold, yet unite as a whole.</p>
<p>As far as parting advice, be honest to yourself and be honest to others.  Surround yourself with people that love and support you.</p>
<p>Love always,</p>

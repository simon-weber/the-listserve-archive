      \ (95 Fahrenheit) and I\u2019m very jealous of all those in the Northern Hemisphere\
      \ celebrating the beginning of winter.\r\n\r\nIt was about a year ago now since\
      \ I joined The Listserve and I had just finished school, and was about to start\
      \ my first year at University. I remember being terrified about my future, I\
      \ was about to start a new stage of my life and yet I had no idea where I was\
      \ headed. Now, after one year, I have a stronger view on what I want to do with\
      \ my life, even though it\u2019s completely different to what I had first thought!\
      \ So hopefully, in 4 years time, I\u2019ll be finished University and starting\
      \ out as a Spanish Teacher. (If anyone reading this is from Spain, I plan to\
      \ visit here in 2014, so if you have any ideas of places to visit I\u2019d love\
      \ to hear from you!)\r\n\r\nI really want to be one of those teachers that a\
      \ student remembers. Because even though high school for me wasn\u2019t the\
      \ greatest time, I can\u2019t deny that I had some brilliant teachers. And I\
      \ think what set them apart was that they really loved what they taught. My\
      \ Ancient History teacher now teaches in Egypt, something he had always wanted\
      \ to do. My English teacher had a great passion for good poetry and good wine\
      \ (I\u2019ve only recently found out this after running into her at the bottle-o).\
      \ My Biology teacher was just so enthusiastic about marine life and how life\
      \ works he would sometimes stand on the table to try and express this. My math\u2019\
      s teacher had a great enthusiasm for boats, and was ecstatic when he taught\
      \ us nautical terms and equations. And so these certain teachers, even if I\
      \ don\u2019t remember everything they taught, did teach me to find my passion\
      \ and use it well. So not only do I want to teach kids Spanish, I also want\
      \ to teach them to never stop searching for that thing you love. And if you\
      \ find it, make it your career, your life work. So in a way, my passion is teaching\
      \ others, and teaching them that they can do anything that they set their mind\
      \ to. And so can you, Listserve reader. It\u2019s never too late to find that\
      \ thing you love.\r\n\r\nI want to leave you with one of my favourite pieces\
      \ of poetry. The author is no one famous, but it is beautiful all the same.\r\
      \n\r\nI tried to forget\r\n\r\nBut you grew roots around my ribcage\r\n\r\n\
      And sprouted flowers\r\n\r\nJust below my collarbones.\r\n\r\nAll day I pluck\
      \ at their petals\r\n\r\nBut I have not yet ascertained\r\n\r\nWhether you love\
      \ me\r\n\r\nOr not.\r\n\r\n                                - Anna Peters\r\n\

      \n\r\nFor a long time now my dream has been to be financially independent, running\

      \ idea to develop. Here are a few ideas I've had (these names are not usually\
      \ what I call the finished product):\r\n- Admoji - an emoji/emoticon chat plugin\
      \ featuring sponsored emojis. Advertisers offer their own emojis (think a smiling\
      \ face holding a Cocacola can) and pay out based on impressions (eyeballs).\
      \ You can earn money for yourself or your favourite charity based on the number\
      \ of times your emoji is viewed.\r\n- Revisit - Reddit meets Google Analytics\
      \ - a site owner installs a tag on their site which logs how many times a specific\
      \ user visits. Sites are then ranked on a central site showing content (articles,\
      \ pages, images etc) ranked on metrics such as length of visit or return visits.\r\
      \n- Tea/coffee alarm - a clip on thermometer which you attach to your tea/coffee\
      \ mug which alerts you when the liquid drops to your perfect temperature (this\
      \ can be changed to suit each person).\r\n- Clipjoin - crowdsourced Youtube\
      \ compilations. Users upvote short (<5 sec) Youtube clips or vine videos in\
      \ a similar style to Reddit. The top 10/20 are automatically combined into 'compilations'\
      \ and featured on the homepage.\r\n- LocalPlaylist - a personalised concert\
      \ recommendation engine. A Spotify app which matches your favourite tracks against\
      \ playlists submitted by local DJs/clubs. It then recommends events to you based\
      \ on what is likely to be played on the night.\r\nI'm not sure which (if any)\
      \ of these projects I'll choose to work on next but I'd appreciate any feedback/ideas.\
      \ If you're interested in things I've worked on before then you can Google 'freeblogging\
      \ me' and 'Rapipad notepad'. I'd also appreciate feedback on these projects\
      \ too. Feel free to incorperate any of the above in your own ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\
      \nHere are some things I've learned:\r\nThe idea is the easiest part. The implementation\
      \ and the marketing are the hardest.\r\n\"Build it and they will come\" is a\
      \ fallacy. Marketing is just as important as implementation if not more so (at\
      \ least at the beginning).\r\nYou can have a relatively successful site which\
      \ gets thousands of visits per day and make very little money - nowhere near\
      \ enough to live on. In most cases, 'Banner ads' is not necessarily a very good\
      \ business model.\r\nI now find myself working for an international conglomerate.\
      \ Strangely it's not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I actually quite\

      \ running out of time and energy to chase their real dream.\r\n\r\n\r\nRobin\r\

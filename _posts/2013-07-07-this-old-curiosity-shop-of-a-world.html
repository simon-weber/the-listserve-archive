<p>I&#8217;m Emily and I&#8217;m newly 21 and celebrated my birthday in Paris next to Canal St. Martin. Things about me&#8212;no one can pronounce my last name; my hair might be red or might be blonde but it&#8217;s definitely curly; I say y&#8217;all; I have a brother and a sister, of whom I am fiercely proud.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m from DC, but have been working in Paris, first with an association that works with African immigrants who have HIV/AIDS. I expected to cry at that job, or to feel pleasantly selfless, but instead I realized the obvious fact that in some places, even Paris, a freckled American girl with a mostly-working knowledge of French doesn&#8217;t quite do the trick. Once a man named Jean with a velvet voice tuned for the radio held my hand and cried because he could never go home, and I couldn&#8217;t tell him in his own language that it would be okay, because I don&#8217;t speak Wolof, and because I knew it wouldn&#8217;t be.  Well, that gutted me.</p>
<p>Now I work with the regional center for AIDS prevention and we talk to high schoolers about prevention and kindness. In some ways, this is easier &#8211; I have a rapport with them because of my age, my skin, how society sees me. But still, I&#8217;m off to the side, I watch. Perhaps I do even less here.</p>
<p>I could tell you love stories about Venice and harrowing tales of falling off rocks in Arizona, but I guess for this email I just couldn&#8217;t decide which to tell. I want to live on a boat and I want to write beautifully or rawly, and I want to speak five languages but most of all I want to be brave and I want to make a difference, which is a hard thing to plan out.</p>
<p>If you want a 21 year old&#8217;s advice, it would be to read Eduardo Galeano&#8217;s Voices of Time, which is amazing; William Least Heat-Moon&#8217;s Blue Highways; and Arturo Perez-Reverte&#8217;s The Nautical Chart, which is a flawed book but still a lovely one.</p>
<p>When William Least Heat-Moon interviewed Miz Alice on Tangier Island, she said &#8220;Some people sit around and wait for the world to poke them. Right here in this old curiosity shop of a world, they say, &#8216;Poke me, world.&#8217;  Well, you have to keep the challenges coming. Make them up if necessary.&#8221; As my mother says, &#8220;Suck the marrow out of it.&#8221; Adventure is out there.</p>
<p>Please write me because I&#8217;d love that. Tell me who you are, how you live, and if you have advice for someone who hasn&#8217;t yet come up with a genius plan to fix things. If you&#8217;re in Paris, on peut prendre une verre; if you&#8217;re in DC, let&#8217;s hit up the Portrait Gallery courtyard; if you&#8217;re elsewhere, see you soon?</p>
<p>The world is bright and black and disappointing but I swear it is never empty.</p>
<p>I am Emily and I want to save the world and write about it, and I love meeting people, and like Hafiz, &#8220;I wish I could show you, when you are lonely or in darkness, the astonishing light of your own being.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>P.S. If quantum theory is correct, and there are parallel universes where all things that could have happened in our lives did happen, in at least one of them I&#8217;d be in that bright kitchen in Venice with Luca and we&#8217;d be making breakfast, and I would just like to say that I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s sad or wonderful that somewhere in space it&#8217;s possible that we never lose anyone at all.</p>

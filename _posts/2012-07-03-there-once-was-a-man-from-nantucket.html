<p>This year is the bicentenary of Edward Lear's birth. He was an author and artist, responsible for The Owl And The Pussycat and the popularisation of limericks. His nonsense inspired me to become the person that I am, so in honour of that wonderfully silly man I thought I&#8217;d inflict some homespun limericks upon you all...</p>
<p>My uncle is blessed with a nose<br />That&#8217;s as crimson as any a rose<br />If you wait until night<br />And then switch off the light<br />You would swear, in the dark, that it glows</p>
<p>Have you heard of the cat on the mat<br />He was lazy and stubborn and fat<br />When a mouse walked on by<br />He would open one eye<br />And say &#8220;Sir, I refuse to touch that!&#8221;</p>
<p>Young Jim would eat nothing but eggs<br />Which he pickled in large wooden kegs<br />When each barrel was done<br />He would jump in for fun<br />And the juices stripped hairs off his legs</p>
<p>A buddhist was studying dharma<br />And assessing his level of karma<br />With a shake of his head<br />He exclaimed &#8220;When I&#8217;m dead<br />I am sure I&#8217;ll come back as a llama&#8221;</p>
<p>On a sunny day sometime in June<br />I decided to go to the moon<br />So I made me a rocket<br />From the foil in my pocket<br />And I&#8217;m sure that I&#8217;ll get there real soon</p>
<p>Thanks for reading,</p>

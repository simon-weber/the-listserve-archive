    <p>I spent a large chunk of my childhood in Germany (in Bavaria and Schwabia to

    beer is superior to every other beer. While that bias was difficult to overcome,
    it finally happened during my first trip with my beer nerd boyfriend&#8212;to
    Belgium. Beyond gorging ourselves on chocolate while there, we spent a lot of

    If you guys ever get a chance to go to Belgium, I would highly recommend you go

    Cafe in the heart of Brussels will give you a sense of it (but don''t drink Delirium,

      <p>Hi everyone, I''m Matt. I''m a student at the University of Melbourne, majoring
      in Discrete Mathematics and Operations Research. The quote above was question
      3a on my Discrete Maths exam last year.</p>

      <p>Whenever I tell someone I''m studying Maths, there''s a fifty-percent chance
      I immediately face the response: "Oh, I HATED Maths in high school!"<br />I''m
      not sure exactly why so many people didn''t enjoy the subject (or why they think
      it''s appropriate to tell me how much they hate one of my favourite things).
      In a spirit of educating the masses (or possibly sharing the pain), I''ve decided
      to show how I solved the problem.</p>

      <p>First off, some definitions. Integers are whole numbers, like 5, 0, or -3.
      A point in R^3 is a set of three coordinates, defining a spot in 3D space. If
      the point (x, y, z) has integer coordinates, x, y, and z are all integers.</p>

      <p>The midpoint of (x, y, z) and (a, b, c) is the sum of both points divided
      by 2. The sum of the points is (x+a, y+b, z+c), and if half of the sum is integer-valued,
      the sum must be even-valued. That is, x+a, y+b and z+c are all even.</p>

      <p>Suddenly our geometry problem has become a parity problem. We know from primary
      school that two evens make an even, two odds make an even, and an even and an
      odd make an odd. Therefore, for x+a to be even, x and a must both be even or
      both be odd - they must have the same parity. The same is true for y and b,
      and z and c. This means that (x, y, z) and (a, b, c) must have the same three-dimensional
      parity.</p>

      <p>In one dimension, there are two parities: even and odd. In two dimensions
      there are four: even-even, even-odd, odd-even, odd-odd. In three dimensions,
      there are eight different parities, but we have nine points.</p>

      <p>The "Pigeonhole Principle" states that if we have N pigeonholes and N+1 pigeons,
      at least two pigeons must be in the same hole. More specifically, if we have
      9 points and eight possible parities, at least two points MUST have the same
      parity. This means the sum of those points MUST be even-valued, and therefore
      the midpoint MUST be integer-valued - and there''s our proof.</p>

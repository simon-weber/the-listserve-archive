<p>I&#8217;m a proud quitter.</p>
<p>Colleges, jobs, lovers, projects, friends, towns, countries, you name it. I would have quit the planet if Mars One had been ready yet. This isn't the part that makes me especially proud.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like Brewster&#8217;s Millions and I&#8217;m the Richard Pryor of quitting: I have a certain amount of Quit to spend each day or I&#8217;ll lose it. The turning point for me was discovering that I could chose, in advance, what to quit and not be forced to meet my quota in regrettable meltdowns.</p>
<p>Quitting isn&#8217;t bad in and of itself. Huh. I can&#8217;t tell you how freeing this realization has been. I mean, I have become such a good quitter that it&#8217;s possibly my superpower--and who wants to relinquish a superpower? No need to when it can be harnessed.</p>
<p>I searched for things to quit. Didn&#8217;t have to look far. Turns out many habits are well worth quitting anyway and take a quitter&#8217;s grit. I focused on habits that *I* can&#8217;t easily moderate, that--no matter how much I enjoy them--addict me. Everyone would have a different list. Roughly in this order, I've quit:</p>
<p> * TV<br /> * Tobacco<br /> * News<br /> * Alcohol<br /> * Marijuana<br /> * Caffeine<br /> * Porn<br /> * Masturbation<br /> * Sugar<br /> * Carbs<br /> * Processed Food</p>
<p>Not everyone can or even should be a quitter, I suppose. But it's worked for me.</p>
<p>How does it feel? Rad, yes. It&#8217;s no magic bullet, but I am much more comfortable being just me right where I am.</p>
<p>What do I do with the extra juice? I enter waking dreams as often as possible: by playing with kids, by drawing, and by reading and writing fiction.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not getting the mileage you want, why not embrace your inner quitter?</p>
<p>Next up on my Quit List:</p>
<p> * Buying New Things<br /> * Making Trash<br /> * Taking It Personally<br /> * Being Quiet About It</p>
<p>I&#8217;m taking suggestions and I&#8217;m curious: What would you quit?</p>
<p><br />Cheers,</p>

<p>P.S. - My science fiction and slice-of-life short stories are out there as ebooks, if you&#8217;re into that kind of thing. Here&#8217;s to keeping quit.</p>

    <p>Colleges, jobs, lovers, projects, friends, towns, countries, you name it. I
    would have quit the planet if Mars One had been ready yet. This isn''t the part
    that makes me especially proud.</p>

    <p>Quitting isn&#8217;t bad in and of itself. Huh. I can&#8217;t tell you how
    freeing this realization has been. I mean, I have become such a good quitter that
    it&#8217;s possibly my superpower--and who wants to relinquish a superpower? No
    need to when it can be harnessed.</p>

    <p>I searched for things to quit. Didn&#8217;t have to look far. Turns out many
    habits are well worth quitting anyway and take a quitter&#8217;s grit. I focused
    on habits that *I* can&#8217;t easily moderate, that--no matter how much I enjoy

    body: "You\u2019re gone now but I can still feel you with me - like a thing I\
      \ was born with.\r\n\r\nYou, lingering caged beneath my skin like the warmth\
      \ that follows the  sun.\r\n\r\nBut now, I feel you more in what I don\u2019\
      t. Absence radiating presence.\r\n\r\nEverything is more here now that you aren\u2019\
      t.  Some nights the radiator buzzes so loud it shakes the bed. Some it\u2019\
      s the silence of being alone that\u2019s deafening. I sing to forget the absence\
      \ of everything but me. I listen to my heart beating or the second hand ticking,\
      \ each forcing their way through something just to begin again from nothing.\r\
      \n\r\nI used to listen to you breathe as I fell asleep.  Each exhale; another\
      \ sheep over the fence.  I never got past 17.\r\n\r\nNow, the sheets are colder\
      \ and my side of the bed seems to sag to the floor.\r\n\r\nAs far back as I\
      \ can remember, I\u2019ve been a restless sleeper. How many nights did my tossing\
      \ leave you sheetless? How many nights did I wake to your tug and my unraveling?\r\
      \n\r\nThree days after you passed I fell asleep and woke-up for the first time.\r\
      \n\r\nThis was the first thing I missed \u2013 the coming undone.\r\n\r\nAwaking,\
      \ a mixture of guilt and habit rolled me and all of your sheets back out. It\
      \ didn\u2019t feel right without you there to take them back. Suddenly, the\
      \ not pulling felt harder than you had ever pulled.\r\n\r\nThe next few nights\
      \ I made sure to tuck the sheets on your side in as firmly as I could.  It felt\
      \ good to have something pull back.\r\n\r\nThe dimming reflections of you would\
      \ slow their fading with something there to play your part. It helped me remember\
      \ to forget. The sinking feeling took a little longer and gave a few more breaths\
      \ before the gasping.\r\n\r\nBut despite my feeble attempts to recreate you,\
      \ the covers would eventually come loose, pulling free from the mouth of our\
      \ bed.\r\n\r\nI tried staples, then tape. I tried anchoring our sheets beneath\
      \ the feet of the bed. The stronger the grip; the more violent the awakening,\
      \ pulling hand over fist just to feel you.  But each night, your grip slowly\
      \ loosened and eventually there was nothing. I would think of myself.\r\n\r\n\
      Soon I was spending more time claiming your sheets than sleeping.  The more\
      \ I claimed, the more your sheets reminded me of you, and the more all of it\
      \ reminded me of me.\r\n\r\nThen, one evening I gave up.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019\
      t know why but I took off my clothes and lay naked in the middle of the bed,\
      \ our bed.\r\n\r\nMy body, one half less yours, one half more mine than I\u2019\
      d ever wanted. I felt half as light and twice as heavy.\r\n\r\nThe skin around\
      \ my nipples cinched tight and bubbled.  I felt your warmth in that cold for\
      \ the first time.\r\n\r\nI pretended my breaths were yours and didn\u2019t get\
      \ past 17.\r\n\r\nIn time your absence became your presence. The cold of our\
      \ mattress was your warmth.  The nothing sheets, not in my hands, not wrapped\
      \ tightly around my shapw became the opposite.\r\n\r\nMy inhales were your exhales.\
      \  Breath in.  Breath out.  One sheep, two.  The negative of your life lived\
      \ with me.\r\n\r\nSleep crept between us, so I fought it until it finally went\
      \ away.  Never asleep, never awake.  Just counting your breaths, that were mine,\
      \ that were sheep. Day in. Day out.  I\u2019m naked, cold and counting.  But\
      \ I\u2019m no longer alone. I feel you in what I no longer feel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\

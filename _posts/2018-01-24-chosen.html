    body: "Several years ago, I was given a huge life lesson. My whole life seemed\
      \ to set  me up for it.\r\n\r\nI was able to look into my past and use skills,\
      \ knowledge, words of wisdom I had picked up. I had wonderful mentors throughout.\
      \ And I mentored a few along the way.\r\n\r\nIn January of 2002 I was given\
      \ a life lesson that required me to use every ounce of knowledge I had to find\
      \ answers in moments of desperation. I was humbled quickly by what I didn't\
      \ know. And for some things, I know I never will. I now learn every day from\
      \ that moment. My teacher? My daughter.\r\n\r\nShe is an amazing girl. As a\
      \ new dad, I reached into my past to recreate moments and lessons from my own\
      \ father and mother. \_But none could prepare me for this journey.\r\n\r\nOur\
      \ beautiful precious daughter was born with intractable seizures. Over 200 per\
      \ day. These seizures were cruel, mean and intolerable. I prayed to God so hard\
      \ to intervene and give me her affliction. Her first neurologist encouraged\
      \ us to put her in an institution and move on. \"Not a chance, Doc.\"  We found\
      \ the right doctors at UCLA who held our girl and whispered to her while having\
      \ a seizure \u201CDear Sweet girl, you are in the right place. We got you.\u201D\
      \ After multiple Neuro Surgeries and medications, our daughter became who she\
      \ is today. While the world sees a developmentally delayed, non-verbal girl,\
      \ her mother and I see her as a miracle.  She communicates through modified\
      \ sign language and an iPad. She is one of the brightest spots of our lives.\r\
      \n\r\nShe has taught us about tolerance, acceptance and patience. She has shown\
      \ us the ugliness of ignorance through others. Most people have heard \"We are\
      \ born with the ability to love, but we learn how to hate.\" This is true for\
      \ her. She yearns for the hug from others, and she understands the power it\
      \ can give. Yet she has not learned how to hate. She has shaped the attitudes\
      \ and lives of her older siblings. For in this, they too have changed how they\
      \ think about and treat people with special needs.\r\n\r\nWhile she will always\
      \ be dependent on others for the rest of her life, it will be others who will\
      \ learn from her and take those lessons into their own lives. She has inspired\
      \ us to create a product for the elderly and those with special needs which\
      \ in turn will help people get the help they need in the event of an accident\
      \ (google \u201CMediPal\u201D it involves your car seatbelt).\r\n\r\nShe is\
      \ my daughter, my teacher, my giver of hugs. \_I titled this email \"Chosen\"\
      \ because sometimes life chooses us to do what we do. It is how we choose to\
      \ take on that life mission that determines our personal definition of success.\
      \ I feel so privileged to have been chosen to be her dad.\_\r\n\r\nWant to learn\
      \ about tolerance, patience, love and acceptance? Be open to those with special\
      \ needs. Volunteer for special Olympics, do what you can to eliminate the \"\
      R\" word from your vernacular and learn to love, forgive, accept and tolerate\
      \ everyone around you. Then pass it on.\_\r\n\r\nGo ahead, we dare you, give\
      \ someone a hug and see the magic of what is possible and the difference you\
      \ can make.\r\n\r\nThanks K for E.\r\nThanks for reading. Have questions? Drop\

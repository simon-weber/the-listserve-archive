      \ on a short, simple project. Don't be afraid; let me explain.Every day, I record\
      \ at least one sound from my environment. Today it was a hollow floor board\
      \ that stuttered like a faulty trumpet, yesterday was a jackhammer on the sidewalk,\
      \ and a couple of weeks ago: a howler monkey asserting his territory. My idea\
      \ is to collect these sounds once a day for 10 years. As of this week, I will\
      \ have successfully completed one and a half years.\r\n\r\nMy intention is to\
      \ sculpt the sounds into pieces of music. Sometimes I find the inherent shape\
      \ of a recording and preserve it - for example, a squeaking ceiling fan might\
      \ produce such an outrageously complex tone that I will map it to a keyboard\
      \ and play it unaffected - while sometimes I might change the character of a\
      \ sound into something completely unrecognizable. I have found that by forcing\
      \ myself into this simple routine, my ears are more aware than they ever have\
      \ been. Also, the pieces of music that I make are now imbued with specific geographical\
      \ and temporal meaning. The song that I am currently writing would not be the\
      \ same without the howler monkey.\r\n\r\nNow for our collaboration - Please\
      \ send me a sound from your world. It could be a voice memo on your phone; pristine\
      \ audio quality is not the point. It could be the birds outside your window\
      \ (for those of you living outside NYC), or your coffee grinder. Short and sweet\
      \ (under one minute) will be ideal. I will make a piece of music utilizing all\
      \ of the Listserve sounds that I receive and dedicate it to you. For proof of\
      \ my work, you may refer to the blog that shares the name of my email address:\
      \ Sampling Is Sexy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn lieu of an inspirational quote, I will\
      \ close with this: \r\n\r\nHelp kids make music. Everyone has something to learn\
      \ from the awareness that young people bring to creating art. Whether practicing\
      \ traditional instruments or using recording technology to manipulate sounds\
      \ in the manner mentioned above, it is incredibly important that children be\
      \ offered the opportunity to listen and make sounds of their own. Developing\
      \ the discipline to listen closely to the world and then respond to it is an\
      \ invaluable use of attention.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for reading.\r\n\r\nCharlie\

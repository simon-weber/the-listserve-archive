<p>A few recommendations based on time constraints:</p>
<p>If you have 4 minutes, listen to Edward Elgar's Nimrod from the Enigma Variations, or Pink Mountaintops' While We Were Dreaming. <br />If you have 8 minutes, listen to Rossini's L'italiana in Algeri.</p>
<p>If you have 50 minutes, watch Top Gear (UK); I recommend the 2007 Botswana special first (series 10, episode 4, available on Netflix). <br />If you have around 80 minutes, watch the Duplass brothers' "Jeff, Who Lives at Home" or Mike Birbiglia's "Sleepwalk with Me," both on Netflix (you can also listen to the latter on Spotify, which is just as great in audio format).</p>
<p>If you have an hour or so, read Antoine de Saint-Exupery's Le Petit Prince.<br />If you have a day or so, read Chaim Potok's The Chosen.</p>
<p>An easy recipe that's a big hit at work parties for being a somewhat healthy appetizer is veggie rolls:<br />Chop up 1 med. broccoli crown, 1 med. green or red bell pepper, and 1 cup carrots. Add to 3 oz softened cream cheese, 12 oz ranch dip, and 2 cups shredded cheddar. Spread thinly among 10-ct tortilla wraps and roll tightly, then roll tightly again in saran wrap. Let them chill in the frig for a few hours, remove the saran wrap, and cut into bite-size pieces.</p>
<p>If you try any of the above, let me know what you think. I'd love to hear your music/movie/book suggestions as well - I'm on twitter at @SamAlleman or use the email below.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

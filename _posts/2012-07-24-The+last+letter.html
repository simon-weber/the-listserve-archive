<p>Hi everyone! First I would like to say that English is not my native language, so forgive my possible (and probable) mistakes!   This letter below I wrote when I was 16 years-old and was going through a difficult phase of my life, and I thought that leaving this world was the only option. I have never showed this letter to anyone, and it was the first thing that came up in my mind when I was invited to write here. Fortunately, I don&#8217;t feel like this anymore and I now I want to live my life and work it out no matter how difficult it gets. There&#8217;s always a way out! : )</p>
<p>Please, stop worrying about whose fault was it. It&#8217;s nobody&#8217;s fault but mine. I did it by my own free will, because I couldn&#8217;t live with myself anymore. I couldn&#8217;t stand the futility of people and their superficial  relationships, and above all, I couldn&#8217;t stand and comprehend my inexplicable desire to be like them.<br />Some say that suicides are the bravest cowards that ever existed.  I disagree. If I&#8217;ve had a little bit of courage, I would have said &#8220;no&#8221; in many times I said &#8221;yes&#8221; without meaning to.<br />I would have said more about how I really felt and less about what other people expected to hear from me. I would have stood up for my  opinions and done what I wanted to do even if the world and the people around me didn&#8217;t  think it was right.<br />I would have enjoyed things more when I had the chance, and complained less when it was no longer worthy.<br />I would have accepted me for who I was, and I would had struggled less battles with myself. Because this last one I lost. I lost because maybe I hadn&#8217;t learned how to fight it right, or because I didn&#8217;t want to fight knowing I would lose it anyway.<br />Actually I think I would have lost  much more if I had continued living the life I was living. The life that was mine and, like everything else that was a part of me, I hated with all my heart.<br />I hope you understand that this was the toughest and selfish decision I have ever had to make.  I&#8217;m not gonna tell you not to be sad or angry, or cry. I just want that the only people who do it are the ones that really cared when I was alive. If my life wasn&#8217;t worth it, please make sure that my death is. I want to thank those who loved me, no matter how: be still because none of you could have stopped me if you tried. I&#8217;m in peace now.</p>

      <p>I always imagined I would have something really clever to tell when I won
      the Listserve, but to be honest.. I feel more confused than ever. So <br />if
      you feel like it - this is your opportunity to share some of your wisdom with
      me :)</p>

      <p>Ever since my childhood years I have felt ''out of place'' and I just assumed
      that "that''s life". Today I feel more ''in place'', and understand that I have
      the power to create the life I live :)</p>

      <p>This spring my doctor put me on sick leave. I was burned out from a stressful
      job. In being a ''good girl'' I had totally exhausted myself trying to be more.
      And six months later I find myself questioning everything.. Why am I here? What
      is my purpose in life? What career would I love? And would it bring in the cash?
      Do I need the cash?</p>

      <p>I have listed some topics I find incredibly interesting, and I would love
      to hear your take on it. </p>

      <p>- Awareness / consciousness<br />- Living off-grid (and self sustained)<br
      />- Ayahuasca - vine of the soul journey<br />- Horses<br />- Healing<br />-
      Travel<br />- Nature as medicine: herb, flower, plant<br />- Speaking with animals<br
      />- Tantra<br />- Wicca<br />- Diving<br />- Free energy</p>

      <p>And here''s a shout out to Christian, my friend and ex-co-worker, who introduced
      me to so many interesting things in life - also the Listserve!</p>

      <p>And a big thank you to all of you for your insightful/funny/serious/sad/enlightening
      words - more than once you have changed the way I see things &lt;3</p>

      <p>All my love to all of you &lt;3</p>

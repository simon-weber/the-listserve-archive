      \ I grew up a 30 minute train ride from, but somehow it was still the one city\

      \ I'm not yet sure if that infinite feeling will ever go away.\r\n\r\nSince\
      \ the tour, I've finally decided to stop living out of my childhood home and\
      \ out of spare bedrooms that my friends have offered up in California and choose\
      \ a place that I can call my own home. I'm two years out of college at this\
      \ point, and it definitely feels like it is time to settle in somewhere. To\
      \ be honest, I didn't really consider doing that anywhere except for New York...\
      \ I'm not sure if it's the never-ending feeling that swirls around the city,\
      \ the amount of culture and music that resonates through all of the streets\
      \ all of the time, or if it's just simply the most practical place for me to\
      \ be right now. I worry about it just being that last one.\r\n\r\nRight now,\
      \ I'm pursuing a career in music, so naturally I'm also working 9-5 in midtown\
      \ at a job that I never really expected myself to be doing-- I'm truly not passionate\
      \ about it and I'm not utilizing any of the skills that I've acquired throughout\
      \ my life. Honestly, I actually don't really do much of anything here... at\
      \ all. It may seem like a dream scenario; go in to work, do next to nothing,\
      \ and walk home every week with a decent-enough paycheck to live in one of the\
      \ world's biggest cities. It doesn't even sound that bad to ME when I put it\
      \ that way, but I've never been one to get satisfaction from being lackadaisical.\
      \ I've always derived happiness and self-worth from hard work, passion, and\
      \ dedication. I get none of that satisfaction here.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I've turned\
      \ this desk at work into a home office of sorts-- I'm writing this listserve\
      \ email from this office, I also planned the entire month-long March tour from\
      \ this office, and I spend a majority of my days here working with someone I\
      \ care about so much (he actually showed me this listserve!) on furthering his\
      \ music career and continuing mine. These are the things I can cite that I'm\
      \ proud of at this point, this office has served as a vehicle for those things\
      \ and I'm grateful for that.\r\n\r\nAnd so I have finally moved to this great\
      \ city... last week. I'm hoping that this move to New York will change things,\
      \ that I will find my place in the city that never ends, that the electricity\
      \ from the streets will seep into my veins and start pumping passion and excitement\
      \ through my body again or it will at least shock me out of this place of comfort\
      \ that's feeding discomfort. Even after spending so much time here, there's\
      \ so much of New York City left to see and I truly hope it leaves me feeling\
      \ infinite myself.\r\n\r\nHope you're all well! \r\nRegina\r\nreginalistserve@gmail.com\r\
      \nNew York, NY\r\n\r\nPS If you'd like to check out the music of the one who\
      \ introduced me to The Listserve, his name is Dylan Owen. He's unbelievably\

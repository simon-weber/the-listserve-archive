      <p>I''d like to introduce myself, but that''s often a struggle because I feel
      split in so many directions that my identity can get a little lost. Unfortunately,
      I can be most accurately described as busy. </p>

      <p>I try my best to be a lot of things - I''m a believer, a wife, a mom, a sister,
      a daughter, a marketing professional by day and a hand-lettering artist by night,
      a church volunteer, secret fan of Bravo TV, an avid reader, a friend... The
      list goes on and I''m sure many of you feel the same pressure of juggling identities
      and doing your best to keep it all afloat (sorry, I can''t even keep a metaphor
      on track).</p>

      <p>I just want to take this opportunity to tell you - I promise you''re doing
      a great job at whatever it is you''re juggling.</p>

      <p>I''ve struggled with anxiety most of my life and it has always rooted in
      comparison and perfection (you can go ahead and add perfectionist to the list
      above). While some days I feel like I''ve got this adulting thing in control...I''ve
      also been the lady staring at my computer screen because my to-do list is so
      long I don''t know where to start, and the lady crying in Target because my
      2-year-old is crying in Target. This whole attempt at perfection just isn''t
      flattering sometimes!</p>

      <p>I''m in the midst of a new attempt to give myself grace and relax a bit on
      that unattainable bar I''ve set. It''s not always going great, but I have been
      able to find rest and the ability to say ""No"" every once in a while! </p>

      <p>I have a few thoughts I''m keeping top-of-mind to avoid a complete mental

      <p>Sometimes in our lives, we are given a little extra time with ourselves.
      A time to think or reflect. For me, that time is the 45 minute drive back from
      my girlfriend&#8217;s house. The empty roads and dark night combine with the
      hypnotic beat of Tiesto, or whatever CD I have in, to create the perfect atmosphere
      for thinking about whatever pops into my head.</p>

      <p>I recall one such night that stands out in my mind, I was driving home on
      the virtually vacant highway under the vast night sky, the beat pounding in
      the background, and I started to feel small. There I was, alone, insignificant,
      flying towards home in a little metal box across my little piece of our grand
      earth&#8217;s surface. It was a kind of solemn feeling, a little sad.</p>

      <p>But then, someone passed me. Another person, driving a small black SUV, passed
      me on that otherwise empty highway, and everything changed. Who is this person?
      Why are they out driving so late? I don''t know them. I wonder if they notice
      me.</p>

      <p>I wonder what stories they could tell me.</p>

      <p>There they were, busy living a life, full of stories, and for a brief moment,
      we were alone, together. Every human being is full of stories. In our little
      heads, we hold histories of our little chunk of this world. And when someone
      dies, in most cases, those stories go away. Each person is a treasure trove
      of anecdotes, captured for only a fleeting moment. That makes every death incredibly
      tragic, and every late night conversation, every stranger met, and every moment
      shared immeasurably valuable. And at that moment, I felt significant. I felt
      blessed to be alive, to be in a state where I can share and hear stories.</p>

      <p>If you''re reading this, you''re also blessed. There are stories all around
      you. Find them. Call your mom, or ask your grandparents what life was like for
      them. Make it a point to meet a stranger. And if you''re so inclined, take a
      moment to send me a story from your life. It doesn''t have to be anything major,
      the little moments can be as valuable as the big. I''d love to hear from you.</p>

      <p>You''re alive. Go find a story. Go make a story. They''re all around you.</p>

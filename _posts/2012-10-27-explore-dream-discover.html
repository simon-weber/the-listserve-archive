      <p>I have kept so many things unsaid thinking that people can read my mind and
      have ended up disappointed in the outcome but really I should have just said
      what I felt or taken the next appropriate step before the disappointment came
      to sneak up on me. I have the &#8220;just do it&#8221; mindset now with everything
      in my life - whether it&#8217;s going up to someone new, asking for a promotion,
      or just being bold and trying to get what I want in life. A lot of situations
      shock me when it turns out in a positive way but of course there are things
      that don''t turn out how I want them to but that just leads me to believe it
      is not meant to be. I truly believe that everything happens for a reason and
      leads me to the next place that IS meant for me.</p>

      <p>Embrace your path, take the chance/risk (so long as it is in a positive way)
      and live your life how you want. Things left unsaid will always be unsaid; things

      <p>That was just homage to my favorite Listserve subject line. You know who
      you are. Respect.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m a 26 year-old professional, and I wanted to get your thoughts on
      what I&#8217;ve seen so far in my place of work.</p>

      <p>What I&#8217;m asking about is, I&#8217;ve been seeing more clearly how the
      women I work with are left out of the loop. When we go out for drinks after
      work, women either aren&#8217;t invited or don&#8217;t come. At the office it&#8217;s
      easier for guys to joke around with my (male) boss before the conversation turns

      <p>I wanted to ask the Listserve about what men can do to make women feel more

      <p>I&#8217;d love to hear from you. And since I might not win again, I&#8217;d
      also like to know what it is you&#8217;d like to do with this one glorious shot

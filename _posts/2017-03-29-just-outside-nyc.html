    body: "I was stuck in bed. It was August of 2008. I\u2019d recently had a lumbar\
      \ puncture, a so-called \u201Cspinal tap\u201D, to analyze my cerebrospinal\
      \ fluid for the telltale signs of multiple sclerosis. As a musician, I couldn\u2019\
      t help but have that ridiculous band of fictional headbangers in mind as I underwent\
      \ the procedure. Unfortunately, my experience was about as enjoyable as their\
      \ notorious act. The puncture left a small opening in my spinal cord, through\
      \ which a tiny bit of fluid was slowly leaking out. This leak posed no significant\
      \ danger, but it did reduce the pressure throughout my central nervous system,\
      \ resulting in a crushing headache. My doctors tried to patch the hole using\
      \ a congealed drop of my own blood, but it didn\u2019t work; it would need to\
      \ seal on its own. I could only reduce the pain to a tolerable level by remaining\
      \ in a horizontal position. So for the next four weeks, while the wound slowly\
      \ healed, flat in bed I stayed, hazily binge-watching The Wire and sipping caffeinated\
      \ energy drinks while pondering what my future might hold.\r\n\r\nI am happy\
      \ to count that experience as the most difficult I\u2019ve faced since my multiple\
      \ sclerosis diagnosis. Thanks to good luck and the excellent care of my family\
      \ and physicians, I\u2019ve so far escaped the more devastating symptoms of\
      \ the disease and avoided any disruptive side effects from treatment. Although\
      \ I suffer from discomfort and a loss of nimbleness in my arms and legs, I retain\
      \ good mobility and (mostly) high spirits. My condition has not impeded my productivity\
      \ or creativity, and in many respects it has enhanced both.\r\n\r\nInterestingly,\
      \ that awful bedridden episode is also inextricably linked with the most emotionally\
      \ powerful moment of my life. I was laying with my head at the foot of the bed\
      \ (for a change of scenery) when my wife quietly entered the room. Unexpectedly,\
      \ she climbed in next to me. I could see trepidation in her eyes and asked what\
      \ was wrong. She told me she was pregnant. In that moment I experienced a wave\
      \ of shock and joy and hope that seems almost magical to me now. I burst into\
      \ peals of laughter, instantly pulled out from my own small struggle and given\
      \ a clarity of purpose that has stayed with me since. It was scary too, of course.\
      \ Every plan about our future had been upended by my recent diagnosis. But suddenly\
      \ it no longer mattered what the details of our circumstances were... I knew\
      \ that together we would figure out a way to make it work.\r\n\r\nEight months\

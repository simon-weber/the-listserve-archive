      <p>I just returned from my parent&#8217;s 60th anniversary party.  We had a
      great time.  I looked up my cousins and far flung relatives and got pictures
      in advance from old and new times and printed them out.  We passed them around
      and told stories.  It was a beautiful way to spend an evening. It was amazing
      to see how, after all those years, and not really know one another, we were
      able to spend hours talking.   I saw cousins, aunts and uncles that I had not
      seen in over 20 years.</p>

      <p>My Dad was diagnosed a few weeks ago with Alzheimer&#8217;s.  I think it
      made the party a little bittersweet for my Mom.  I don&#8217;t know if Dad will
      have another time when he recalls everyone still.  It breaks my heart.  He is
      82.  His older brother is 86.  He told me we would never see his brother or
      each other again.  It&#8217;s too sad to think about.</p>

      <p>Celebrate life and your family.</p>

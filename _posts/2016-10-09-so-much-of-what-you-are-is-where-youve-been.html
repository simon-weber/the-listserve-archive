      <p><br />Hello world,</p>

      <p>Everyone has a to-do list. Few just keep it restricted to self, others write
      it down somewhere so that others can read and maybe motivate or help in ticking
      the items off it. What about your to-do list?</p>

      <p>Traveling to new places has been one of the top items on my to-do list but
      have not been able to keep up with it in recent years. Hoping to add a lot of
      places to visited list soon.</p>

      <p>I fell in love with cycling a few years back and completed my first brevet
      this year. Looking forward to riding PBP in 2019.</p>

      <p>Have always loved writing code to solve problems. Thanks to my high school
      teachers for introducing with it in a great way. RaspberryPi and Arduino have

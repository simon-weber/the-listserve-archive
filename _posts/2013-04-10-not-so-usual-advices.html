    <p>My name is Barboza, from a city in the southest part of Brazil. And unfortunately

    <p>- Dont own, share:<br />     In a few years, status will not be how much you
    own, but how much you can share.<br />- Travel, but always return home:<br />     Travel
    is one of the best things to do, but dont make the return home the worst part
    of the trip. If you do, its not to your hearth''s home that you are returning
    to.<br />- Protect your ideals, but respect other''s opinions<br />     Its not
    because he thinks different from you that he''s wrong, or that you''re wrong.
    Every point of view deppends on the angle that you see the point.<br />- Make
    others be in debt with you<br />    Do favors and help others without charging,
    they probably will return the favor in a moment of need, but dont get mad if they
    dont.</p>

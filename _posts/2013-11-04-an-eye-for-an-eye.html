  body: "A few months ago my boyfriend, Alexander, pulled a fairly elaborate prank\
    \ and convinced me I had won The Listserve lottery.  I wrote a satirical piece\
    \ on the superfluous things in this world that I love and hate.  After submitting\
    \ my masterpiece I eagerly waited for its distribution to the masses.  A few hours\
    \ after my submission I received an email from what I presumed to be The Listserve\
    \ indicating that my piece needed some editing.  The email referred me to an attachment\
    \ with suggested revisions.  A bit confused by the situation, I opened the attachment\
    \ to find a presentation documenting each step of the hoax with colorful commentary\
    \ provided by my boyfriend.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, I received yet another email claiming\
    \ I had won The Listserve lottery.  I immediately assumed this was another, albeit\
    \ uncreative, attempt by Alexander to prank me yet again.  However, after an email\
    \ exchange with one of The Listserve's co-founders I was able to confirm its authenticity.\
    \ This time it was the real deal!  My initial thought was to submit the love /\
    \ hate piece I wrote as victim to the aforementioned prank.  But then, it hit\
    \ me, this was my chance at retribution!  The interweb gods were giving me a chance\
    \ to do unto my boyfriend as he had done unto me.\r\n\r\nSo, fellow Listservians,\
    \ I humbly request your help in assisting me in paying it forward to my lovely\
    \ boyfriend.  I ask that you send him an email at renzi.alexander@gmail.com with\
    \ the content of your choosing \u2013 the more obnoxious the better, but a blank\
    \ email will also suffice \u2013 and title it \u201CIt is what it is\u201D.\r\n\
    \r\nFor those of you interested in what I originally intended to submit, I\u2019\
    ve provided an abridged version below.  Please feel free to email me for the full\
    \ length.  For those interested in seeing the presentation that set the wheels\
    \ in motion for this post, send me an email as well.\r\n\r\n** Things I Love and\
    \ Hate (Abridged Version)**\r\n\r\n1.   Gelato (love) \u2013 For a period of time\
    \ I was taking down two to three cones per week and would occasionally indulge\
    \ in a full pint.  I\u2019ve come to realize my love for the cold, creamy goodness\
    \ has entered an unhealthy territory.  The solution \u2013 to open up my own gelateria\
    \ and fully embrace the obsession.\r\n\r\n2.   Pandas (love) \u2013 Pandas are\
    \ amazing because they\u2019re (i) ethnically diverse, (ii) peaceful, bamboo-eating\
    \ vegetarians and (iii) have a level of dexterity comparable to humans.  I also\
    \ own far too many panda-related articles of clothing (hats, sweaters, tanks,\
    \ etc.), which is irrelevant to why pandas are awesome, but completely relevant\
    \ as to why I am.\r\n\r\n3.   2Chainz (love) \u2013 2Chainz is not a rapper, but\
    \ rather a poet that speaks eloquently against a high tempo backdrop.  The only\
    \ rapper even comparable to 2Chainz would be Gucci Mane, not for his ability to\
    \ create thought-provoking rhymes, but because he has a tattoo of an ice cream\
    \ cone plastered on the side of his face (I\u2019ve already established why that\
    \ would merit high praise in my book).\r\n\r\n4. Skele-Toe Sneakers (hate) \u2013\
    \ Feet are ugly enough on their own, so why wear shoes to further accentuate the\
    \ ugliness of this appendage.  I\u2019m convinced that anyone who owns these sneakers\
    \ has no friends or family, no strong desire to procreate and lacks any semblance\
    \ of respect for themselves or other humans.\r\n\r\n5.   Oysters (hate) \u2013\
    \ I\u2019ve eaten enough oysters to know that anyone who says they like them is\
    \ probably lying and should not be trusted.  They have a gross, gelatin-like consistency\
    \ and taste like a hybrid of saltwater and earwax.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeva Niaz\r\nniazdeva@gmail.com\r\

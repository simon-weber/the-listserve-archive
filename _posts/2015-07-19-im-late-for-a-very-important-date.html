    body: "Hello! I hope you are all having a great day! This email will just be some\
      \ of my thoughts, as I love to know whats going on in others minds. \r\n\r\n\
      1) I am a 21-year-old student studying engineering. I move every four months\
      \ because of my co-op stream, which makes life pass by extraordinarily quickly.\
      \ Imagine just as you're getting used to a place, having to leave it. For someone\
      \ that is more introverted, I find this very hard. Especially when it comes\
      \ to making friends. \r\n\r\n2) I suck at responding to people. I'm the person\
      \ that gets back to you a week later. I don't know how to stop it as I think\
      \ I would have closer friends if I kept up with them more when we're away from\
      \ each other. I leave sticky notes and random text messages to myself to try\
      \ and remind myself to get back to people, but I just don't. Maybe it's because\
      \ I'm not always sure what to say back or maybe I'm selfish and content with\
      \ the information I have and feel no need to share further. I hope it's not\
      \ the second. Sometimes I think thats it's all the platforms that are \"required\"\
      . Maybe if I picked one it would be easier. But I love having the opportunity\
      \ to catch glimpses into other peoples lives (that facebook etc provides) too\
      \ much to delete it. \r\n\r\n3) I struggle with working hard at school. I don't\
      \ necessarily feel like I have a goal right now that I'm striving towards. Grad\
      \ school? A job? What kind of job? I like everything I've done on co-op so it\
      \ doesn't make it much easier. \r\n\r\n4) When I'm in a good mood my self-esteem\
      \ can be quite high. I feel like the cards that were dealt to me in life were\
      \ pretty fantastic as I'm capable of a lot of different things, often conflicting\
      \ with stereotypes and assumptions that people have about me (aka I'd consider\
      \ myself a girly girl, but I'm in engineering which is typically considered\
      \ a more male career path). I actually really like this about myself and I like\
      \ to think that it it helps me to withhold judgement from other people until\
      \ I know them better. \r\n\r\n5) This being about to do a lot of things is also\
      \ the bane of my existence as it adds to my indecisiveness, which is already\
      \ quite high. I have done so many different things in terms of sports or other\
      \ activities and I wouldn't say I am great at any of them, but capable in all.\
      \ Jack of all trades types of things. Thats exactly what my degree is too as\
      \ I pretty much sample all of the engineering disciplines plus get some really\
      \ cool electives. \r\n\r\n6) I'm moving to San Francisco (bay area) soon! If\

      <p>1) I am a 21-year-old student studying engineering. I move every four months
      because of my co-op stream, which makes life pass by extraordinarily quickly.
      Imagine just as you''re getting used to a place, having to leave it. For someone
      that is more introverted, I find this very hard. Especially when it comes to
      making friends. </p>

      <p>2) I suck at responding to people. I''m the person that gets back to you
      a week later. I don''t know how to stop it as I think I would have closer friends
      if I kept up with them more when we''re away from each other. I leave sticky
      notes and random text messages to myself to try and remind myself to get back
      to people, but I just don''t. Maybe it''s because I''m not always sure what
      to say back or maybe I''m selfish and content with the information I have and
      feel no need to share further. I hope it''s not the second. Sometimes I think
      thats it''s all the platforms that are "required". Maybe if I picked one it
      would be easier. But I love having the opportunity to catch glimpses into other
      peoples lives (that facebook etc provides) too much to delete it. </p>

      <p>3) I struggle with working hard at school. I don''t necessarily feel like
      I have a goal right now that I''m striving towards. Grad school? A job? What

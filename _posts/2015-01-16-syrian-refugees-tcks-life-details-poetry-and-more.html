    body: "So I won. I have been a part of the Listserve for almost 5 years. There\
      \ have been several times when I wanted to be chosen. Now I am sitting in the\
      \ country of Jordan caught totally surprised by the email saying I won. I had\
      \ always hoped I would be doing something memorable when I got the email. The\
      \ first draft of this email was very different. Then I heard a story about a\
      \ Syrian Refugee that I wanted to share.  \r\n\r\nA volunteer went to a Syrian\
      \ family over a year and a half ago. There was a 5 year old boy who had experienced\
      \ bombing  while fleeing the country. The volunteer tried to get the boy to\
      \ play but he just stayed catatonic. From then on the volunteer held the boy\
      \ in his arms every time he visited. This went on for about 6 months. Then the\
      \ volunteer brought a ball and put it in the boy's hand. Nothing happened till\
      \ the boy dropped the ball. It didn't bounce but stayed on the ground for a\
      \ few seconds before shooting across the room. The boy chased after it and started\
      \ showing emotion for the first time. All it took was love and human affection\
      \ to work over time. That and the servant willing to share God's love.\r\n\r\
      \nAs the Syrian conflict gets less coverage in the news, it is easy for the\
      \ refugees to be forgotten. I am currently working with them in the Middle East.\
      \ On a personal level, I could urge you to to volunteer to help refugees here\
      \ in the Middle East or in your own country. I could urge you to give money\
      \ or pray. What I will ask you to do is not just think about the refugees and\
      \ move on. \r\n\r\nNow on to me. My name is Micah Jordan. I am currently 20\
      \ years old, in my 3rd year of college studying communication and history are\
      \ small private college in Missouri. But I was born in South Korea, lived there\
      \ 8 years then Manila Philippines for 8 years. I am called a third culture kid\
      \ or TCK. If you want to know more google it. Being a TCK has impacted my perspective\
      \ on the world. I have gotten do so many things like fly an airplane before\
      \ driving a car. For sake of space I can't elaborate. If you would like to know\
      \ more please email me. I love talking about my life experiences.   \r\n\r\n\

    body: "Most of my life I was afraid to be myself. So I lived the life of someone\
      \ else. My non-self protected me from what I feared the most, judgment and rejection,\
      \ so I blindly let it rule my life. My non-self ignored my heart\u2019s desires\
      \ and pleasing others became more important. My non-self kept me from living\
      \ my life\u2019s true purpose and it kept me from singing my song uniquely,\
      \ as only I can.\r\n\L\r\nI write to you as someone who's spent the majority\
      \ of my life being afraid to embrace my life's calling; for me, that calling\
      \ has always been to write and perform music. Music that shines a light on some\
      \ of the inequalities still present in our world today. Now you may wonder what\
      \ finally triggered me to leave my non-self behind. Well, let me tell you.\_\
      \ My journey to adulthood began 10 years ago when I packed two suitcases and\
      \ moved from Sweden to the U.S. for college. What I didn\u2019t know then was\
      \ that this was the first of many decisions that I would end up making, or rather,\
      \ that my non-self would make for me out of fear.\r\n\L\r\nI had always been\
      \ a top student, ambitious throughout high school, so I saw a college education\
      \ as the obvious next step. But my dream since I was a child was to sing and\
      \ write music.\_ Growing up my parents always supported my desire to pursue\
      \ music but it was encouraged only as a hobby. My parents placed tremendous\
      \ weight on the importance of education because they feared that if I weren\u2019\
      t highly educated I would go through life enduring the same struggles as they\
      \ did, particularly with economic hardships.\r\n\L\r\nMy parents fled the war\
      \ in Eritrea and the military regime when they were in their early 20s and migrated\
      \ to Sweden due to its receptiveness of immigrants, at the time. My father always\
      \ described it as an involuntary move and longed for Eritrean independence.\
      \ I always respected my parents\u2019 wishes because I saw them sacrificing\
      \ so much for my siblings and I and our everyday freedom. I was determined to\
      \ make my parents proud so I told myself I\u2019d keep making music fleetingly\
      \ and one day I would get to do it full-time. But the more time that passed\
      \ the harder it became.\r\n\L\r\nFive years ago I decided to attend law school\
      \ at Fordham in New York City. This was yet another decision in my life based\
      \ on fear and misguidance.\_ I was in my first year of law school when I began\
      \ experiencing severe anxiety. I was falling behind in my studies and I was\
      \ the girl nobody wanted in their study group. I felt like a complete outsider\
      \ that did not belong there. And naturally that is how others in school viewed\
      \ me as well, since what you reflect is what is returned to you, always. So\
      \ everyday for three years I considered dropping out. But I never did. I never\
      \ dared to take the leap though I was clearly unhappy. I just kept dipping my\
      \ toes in the water but I never took the plunge.\r\n\L\r\nI just reached my\
      \ word limit. But if you are interested in how my story unfolds it just so happens\
      \ that I recently gave a TEDx talk on this subject (Spoiler alert: I took the\
      \ plunge!). The title is \u201CUse Your Voice Uniquely, As Only You Can.\u201D\
      \ I hope my story will inspire you to leave your non-self behind as well. It\u2019\
      s truly remarkable how life changes once you get over that initial wall of fear.\_\

      \ I would love to see where do you live aswell!)\r\nThats why lets talk about\
      \ advertising stuff. Im pretty sure you all experienced that pop-ups things\
      \ when you browse somewhere in internet for something important. Casino, binary\
      \ options, datings, games - whatever. Thats what I do for my job. I am a media\
      \ buyer. The first thing that my friends tell me once I give them a reply about\
      \ my job is \"Oh my gosh, that was YOU!\", so if you hate me, I understand that\
      \ :) But I must admit, I really love my job. I work with people from all around\
      \ the world, its jus like a travel but without moving. If you have any questions\
      \ regarding it, I will gladly answer.\r\nAdvertising will stay live as long\
      \ as at least 1 from 1000, as we say, \"make a conversion\" - register on dating\
      \ website, install a game, make a deposit in casino. \r\nAnd so is dream. \r\
      \nKeep dreaming, and work on making your dreams come true.\r\nI will share with\
      \ you one of my dreams - to visit as many places as its possible. There is no\
      \ time to stop. While you move, you stay alive.\r\nI already got an italian\
      \ visa, so that will be my next destinaton! Probably I will meet any of you\
      \ there ;)\r\nBring all the best to 2015 and Happy New Year!\r\n\r\nP.S. Happy\
      \ New Year - \"S Novim Godom\" in russian language. Now you know more about\

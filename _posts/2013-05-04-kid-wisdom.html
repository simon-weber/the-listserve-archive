<p>Hello Listserve friends,</p>
<p>I am currently finishing my first year teaching.  I teach English Language Arts to 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th graders at a small school in rural Vermont.  So many people have told me I'm crazy for choosing to spend my days with middle school kids, and while I often laugh off those comments, I can't say I always disagree.  Occasionally I have days where I want to bang my head against something (I've only indulged in this desire once!), but most of my days are actually filled with laughter and learning; and it's not just my students who are learning.  They may be young, but my students know levels of tragedy and joy that I can only imagine.  They teach me more than they will ever know.   <br />We see plenty of advice pour into our inboxes via The Listserve, but instead of rattling off what little I know of the world, I decided to ask my students to inspire you with their best pieces of advice, since they are my daily inspiration.  Here are some of the highlights...</p>
<p>Words of wisdom from kids (ages 10-14):</p>
<p>*Always wear socks<br />*Never let anyone take over your dreams<br />*Don't eat yellow snow (and if you find something brown on the ground, it's probably not chocolate)<br />*When people are nice to you, be nice back. It's like someone giving you a present and you giving one back.<br />*Life will be a lot easier if you mind your own business<br />*Never try to ride a shopping cart down a hill<br />*Don't be mouthy to your parents<br />*Pie makes everything better<br />*Go outside and do something with your life<br />*Keep calm; life goes on<br />*Mountains will crumble, oceans will freeze over, and whole cities will be destroyed if you are late for math class<br />*Never take a good friend for granted<br />*Never leave the empty milk carton in the fridge<br />*If you ever love two people, go with the second one because if you really loved the first one, you wouldn't have fallen in love again<br />*You don't need to use two sheets of toilet paperc just because it's etiquette or fancy; use what get the job done (that also applies to relationships and life choices... but mostly toilet paper)</p>

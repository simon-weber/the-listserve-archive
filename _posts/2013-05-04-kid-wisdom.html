      <p>I am currently finishing my first year teaching.  I teach English Language
      Arts to 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th graders at a small school in rural Vermont.  So
      many people have told me I''m crazy for choosing to spend my days with middle
      school kids, and while I often laugh off those comments, I can''t say I always
      disagree.  Occasionally I have days where I want to bang my head against something
      (I''ve only indulged in this desire once!), but most of my days are actually
      filled with laughter and learning; and it''s not just my students who are learning.  They
      may be young, but my students know levels of tragedy and joy that I can only
      imagine.  They teach me more than they will ever know.   <br />We see plenty
      of advice pour into our inboxes via The Listserve, but instead of rattling off
      what little I know of the world, I decided to ask my students to inspire you
      with their best pieces of advice, since they are my daily inspiration.  Here
      are some of the highlights...</p>

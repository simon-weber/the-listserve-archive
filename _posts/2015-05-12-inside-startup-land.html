      <p>Can&#8217;t believe I actually won the listserve!</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m a 22 yo marketer who moved to San Francisco last year.  Startup
      culture is pretty amazing, but I think sometimes we get so wrapped up in ourselves
      that we miss the bigger picture.</p>

      <p>Here are some of my ideas on running a great startup:</p>

      <p>1. Make a 10x improvement.  The world doesn&#8217;t need another messaging
      app.  Sure, messaging apps like FB Messenger, Line, and WhatsApp are the craze
      of the moment, but I&#8217;d much rather start something like Theranos (their
      lab technology could save the US healthcare system ~$200 billion over 10 years).</p>

      <p>2. Always put people first.  Both for customers and employees, putting people
      first might be more expensive in the short-term, but it always pays off in the
      long run. It&#8217;s easy to focus on the numbers, but invest the time to build
      a humble, transparent company culture.</p>

      <p>3. Don&#8217;t be mediocre. Lots of companies can build pretty decent products,
      but the really epic experiences are fairly rare.  I recently had a problem with
      my GoRuck backpack, and they immediately sent me a brand new backpack under
      their lifetime guarantee (more than two years after I first purchased!).</p>

      <p>4. Find a way to make money.  Too many startups take a loss for years and
      run off venture capitalist investments.  Sometimes that&#8217;s necessary (like
      if you need a large infrastructure), but cash flow is quite freeing.</p>

      <p>Also, I&#8217;m a bit of a book geek, so I&#8217;d love to hear your favorite
      books! (My favorite lately was Red Notice by Bill Browder)</p>

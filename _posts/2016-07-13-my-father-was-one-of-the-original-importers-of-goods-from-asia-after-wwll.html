      \ Napa Valley. My dad's family had moved to California in the early 1940's for\
      \ work and as soon as he graduated high school he went into the army. He was\
      \ lucky since it was the end of the war and he was shipped out to Germany where\
      \ things were finished rather than the pacific. He came back, went to Berkeley\
      \ on the GI bill, graduated, married my mom who was 19, he was 25. He went to\
      \ work for one of his fraternity brother's father who was selling scarves that\
      \ he got from NYC. They were approached by a guy who knew nothing about the\
      \ accessories industry to design a scarf that would be made in Japan and then\
      \ imported to the U.S.. They created a scarf out of designs from postcards sold\
      \ to tourists. It went to Japan and then back to U.S. It sold out in one day\
      \ at the City of Paris Department Store mainly to the GIs in SF now returning\
      \ from Korea. They continued to import silk scarves from Japan until it became\
      \ too expensive and then knitwear from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea and other Asian\
      \ countries. They became the knock off artists, buying expensive designer sweaters,\
      \ tweaking them and creating goods for the masses. After I recently interviewed\
      \ my Dad who at 88 still gets up everyday and goes to work for a few hours,\
      \ I searched eBay for the scarf with the postcards, I was rewarded  recently\
      \ with one which I will frame.\r\nI love to sew and knit. I also needlepoint,\

      \ from growing up with someone in the fashion industry as well as the lineage\
      \ on my mother's side where my great grandfather was a tailor in Oakland in\
      \ the early part of the 20th century and my grandmother taught me handwork.\
      \ I have traveled to learn from skilled knitting teachers around the world.\
      \ Handwork is something that gives me pleasure and has been an important facet\

      \ good food and enjoy having people gather at my table. I went back to school\

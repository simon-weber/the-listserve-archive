    body: "Hey, I\u2019m Arthur Meyer.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m gonna just write a bunch of\
      \ different stuff.\r\n\r\n1. My girlfriend Kat (whom I\u2019ve made love to)\
      \ has this sleeveless t-shirt that has a penguin on the front, and on the back\
      \ it says \u201CMay 2, 1987.\u201D Exactly one year earlier \u2013 May 2, 1986\
      \ \u2013 200 of the world\u2019s top photojournalists set out across America\
      \ and took photos all that were eventually compiled into an amazing book called\
      \ \u201CA Day In The Life Of America.\u201D Weird about that whole May 2 thing,\
      \ right?\r\n\r\n2. I only read like 1 out of every 20 of these Listserve emails.\
      \ I feel bad that I don\u2019t read more of them, but also it\u2019s okay. We\u2019\
      re all alive now and will all die one day.\r\n\r\n3. I always wonder whether\
      \ the editosr at Listsever correct any spelling errors or if they just leave\
      \ them in.\r\n\r\n4. I\u2019m a writer and performer at \u201CThe Tonight Show\
      \ Starring Jimmy Fallon.\u201D What do you guys think of that show? Feel free\
      \ to email me back and let me know. arthurmeyer13@gmail.com is my email. Some\
      \ people like it, and some people don\u2019t. I like working there a lot. The\
      \ people are wonderful. So is Jimmy. Before I was hired (back in 2012), I would\
      \ appear on the show playing an NBC page. I did that for three years. One day,\
      \ we were rehearsing a sketch, and Jimmy interrupted to surprise me by hiring\
      \ me as a writer. It was one of the best moments of my life.\r\n\r\n5. Once\
      \ I was on shrooms and my friend Zack and I were walking through Central Park,\
      \ and we 100% saw Katie Couric by herself, and she was 100% wearing spandex\
      \ workout clothing, and she was 100% on her phone, and the only thing we heard\
      \ her say was, \u201CPersonalization is hard for me.\u201D I have no idea what\
      \ that means, but I swear on the Lord\u2019s anus, that truly happened.\r\n\r\
      \n6. I actually have my own Listserve. It\u2019s called The Donald P. McMahon\
      \ Project (arbitrarily named after a college sociology professor).  I started\
      \ it in 2011 (three years before my friend Gavin Purcell told me about this\
      \ Listserve). Each week, a different person in the project chooses their favorite\
      \ album of all time, and they write whatever they want about why they love the\
      \ album or what it means to them. I include a written introduction about how\
      \ I know that person.  The email also includes a Spotify link to listen to that\
      \ album. And it includes anything else that anyone wants to share pertaining\
      \ to music. Yesterday we completed Week 300. Let me know if you want to join\
      \ that project. I might not be able to add you depending on how many people\
      \ respond, but let me know anyway. I\u2019m a nice guy. I\u2019m Jewish.\r\n\
      \r\n7. Feel free to write an email to me. You can say anything, but please answer\
      \ these three questions:\r\n\r\nA) Do you like grapefruit juice?\r\n\r\nB) Describe\
      \ the best and worst kisses or make out sessions you\u2019ve ever had.\r\n\r\
      \nC) What\u2019s the worst name for a baby you can think of?\r\n\r\n8. I was\
      \ on acid for my third time ever when I got the email that I\u2019d been chosen\
      \ for Listserve. How insane is that? There are almost 22,000 people in this\
      \ thing, which equates to almost 60 years. And I got the email one hour into\
      \ an acid trip. Das fuh\u2019d up.\r\n\r\n9. You are formally invited to my\

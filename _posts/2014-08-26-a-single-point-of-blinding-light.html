      <p>I''ll try to keep this from being tl;dr.</p>

      <p>Email flows all too naturally in just one direction, and tends to feel plastic
      / impersonal. The beauty of the Internet is how it can create meaningful dialogue
      if used correctly and with tact. Making the Internet a more warm, welcoming
      place can only help electronically-connected mankind.</p>

      <p>With that said, let''s connect and create that dialogue (or at least try).
      I''ll propose three (almost) universally-enjoyed topics:</p>

      <p>1)  Exploration. I''m from the States but travel / live abroad 100% of my
      days. I''d love to hear about your excursions, and places that I miss as I conduct
      mine. I post shots from my iPhone on an Instagram account:  @N_AMERICAN_SCUM
      (no fancy camera - this helps keep it about the experience, not the photo)</p>

      <p>A few places I''ve visited over the past year where the sense of adventure
      felt especially real:</p>

      <p>-Mount Kinabalu, Borneo<br />-Jungles of Amazonas, Brazil<br />-Mount Kenya<br
      />-Cradle Mountain, Tasmania</p>

      <p>2)  Auditory pleasures. Sometimes music feels like the end all / be all to
      me. It comforts, it mends, it inspires, it makes nearly every situation better.</p>

      <p>I write this while listening to one of my favorite albums ever:  Nord by
      Year of No Light. Ben Frost''s A U R O R A may be my favorite album thus far
      in 2014. I''m pretty excited about The Underachievers LP coming out next week,
      and Run the Jewels 2 whenever that happens to drop.</p>

      <p>Let''s talk about music on Spotify:  kpa_kpa_kpa</p>

      <p>3)  The saccharification of starch and the fermentation of the resulting
      sugar (thanks Wikipedia!). I spend far too much time seeking out the beer innovations
      and successes of various cultures around the world. Let''s discuss - Untappd:
      @N_American_Scum</p>

      <p>A few of my beer happy places:</p>

      <p>-Jester King - Austin, Texas<br />-Mikkeller Bar - K&#248;benhavn, Denmark<br
      />-T&#216;RST - Brooklyn, New York<br />-Moon Dog Brewing - Melbourne, Australia</p>

      <p>That''s all. Looking forward to meeting all of you; electronically, in real
      life, or otherwise.</p>

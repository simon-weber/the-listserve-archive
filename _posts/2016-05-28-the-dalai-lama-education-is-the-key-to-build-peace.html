      <p>I hope this note finds you well. Currently I am in india. My journey to this
      country began on April 30th, 2016 when I traveled from Morocco to New Delhi
      to attend an interfaith exchange program with the Dalai Lama. I never thought
      i would meet him and in his compound in Dharmasala, i heard a lot about him,
      but meeting him has never crossed my mind. <br />A very funny guy he was during
      our meeting. Well what to expect from someone considered to a Symbol of peace
      and compassion.<br />What brought me to India has a relationship to what is
      happening in my small community in the southeast of Morocco and around the world
      as well, it is extremism and mainly the religious one.</p>

      <p>People from 13 countries came to India to learn from the wisdom of the Dalai
      Lama, to learn about healing after traumas, to learn about love, compassion,
      and forgiveness. It is very hard to forgive someone who has hurt you or hurt
      someone you care for and love. After all, we are humans, we make mistakes, and
      the best people are those who learn from their mistakes.<br />Forgiveness is
      something we all need to learn and practice in order to have inner peace. Because
      that is how global peace is achieved, starting with one''s self.</p>

      <p>My trip to india has taught me patience, compassion, and love. As  people
      living in this planet, we need to educate the next generation about peace, as
      good quality education is what will make us live in a peaceful world. As by
      then, people won''t be extremists because peace will be a priority for them.</p>

      <p>So my friends, Let us educate the next generation, let us build peaceful

      \ But I felt proud when she asked me to slow down a little.The trail started\
      \ to climb. I wanted to stop in the shade and have some water, but I didn\u2019\
      t want to be the one to ask. Neither did she. We had that in common. Finally,\
      \ she asked for her water bottle. I drank slowly so we could rest for a moment\
      \ in the dappled shade. We didn\u2019t say much, just a few words about how\
      \ hot it was and how we hoped we were getting close to the top. She was tough,\
      \ and I was trying to grow up to be tough too. My head pounded with each step,\
      \ and I tried not to look up at how high the trail climbed. She was silent,\
      \ but every time I turned she wasn\u2019t far behind.\r\n\r\nWe crested a ridge,\
      \ at last, and the valley lay before us. Below us were bright green meadows\
      \ and slopes stitched together with clear-running streams. That\u2019s what\
      \ I imagined Eden might have looked like, filled with life and beauty and a\
      \ little bit of violence. I saw a marmot sunning itself on a rock. It raised\
      \ its head and cried out at me, eyes squinting and jaws open wide, showing teeth.\r\
      \n\r\nI walked past a boulder, and there were two mountain goats staring back\
      \ at me. The first was young, hornless, half-jumping on gangly legs. It was\
      \ white and fluffy, and walked jerkily toward me. Its mother studied me more\
      \ carefully. She had two wickedly sharp black horns, and her fur was shaggier,\
      \ matted and brown near her underbelly. Her eyes were black and still. She took\
      \ a few steps toward me and herded the young one back. My mother warned me too,\
      \ and I backed away slowly.\r\n\r\nSeeing her climbing up the last section of\
      \ rocks before the lake, I somehow knew that this would be the last time we\
      \ did something like this together. I wanted her to see the lake first, and\
      \ she did. She stopped at the top of the boulder pile and waited for me. A breeze\
      \ was riffling the surface of the lake, breaking the mirror sheen I\u2019d seen\
      \ in photos. But the real lake had its own wild, rough-edged beauty.\r\n\r\n\
      The water was gray, reflecting the mountain behind it and the sky above it.\

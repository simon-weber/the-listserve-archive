      \ or girl: the shameless self-publicist, the human spambot. And yet, sometimes\
      \ we do create great work that we\u2019d like others to know about \u2013 what\
      \ then? How do we decide when our work is good enough, important enough, to\
      \ warrant puffing up our chests and shouting about it?\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been\
      \ working on a creative project with a small team for over a year now, and a\
      \ few months ago we stepped back and realised we were done. It wasn\u2019t perfect,\
      \ but we knew we couldn\u2019t hold off much longer: it was time to launch it\
      \ into the world.\r\n\r\nWe immediately found ourselves stuck, with no idea\
      \ how to get the word out without feeling silly or boastful. We\u2019re all\
      \ introverts and prone to self-deprecation. We\u2019re not used to saying, \u201C\
      Hey, everyone, look over here! What we\u2019ve done is pretty amazing!\u201D\
      \ We could see flaws in our work and could see where it was lacking. We were\
      \ acutely aware that our project wasn\u2019t going to save lives or leave anybody\
      \ slack-jawed in wonderment. So we decided to postpone the launch and keep tweaking.\
      \ Tweaking was easier. Less scary.\r\n\r\nIn a similar vein, a friend of mine\
      \ has been working on his novel for years. Every six months or so, he\u2019\
      ll retrieve it from inside a deeply-nested folder on his hard drive and spend\
      \ the next two months re-drafting it. When he\u2019s done, he\u2019ll leave\
      \ it for six months and redraft it again. I suspect he feels uncomfortable taking\
      \ the next step and pitching it to a publisher because there\u2019s already\
      \ so much great writing out there, and he\u2019s wary of appearing arrogant.\r\
      \n\r\nMy guess is that there are a lot of us out there: those that maybe should\
      \ be talking our work up more, should be properly launching the projects we\u2019\
      ve worked hard on, and should be more comfortable marketing the stuff we\u2019\
      ve created. It\u2019s a shame that, in some cases, those who are most comfortable\
      \ with self-marketing are those without anything interesting to promote in the\
      \ first place. Meanwhile, some of the greatest living artists and thinkers are\
      \ right now almost certainly working in obscurity, lacking the confidence or\
      \ the platform to show the world what they\u2019re doing.\r\n\r\nFor those of\
      \ us that aren\u2019t prone to shouting about ourselves, we risk being drowned\
      \ out by those that can and do. The presumption is that if you don\u2019t say\
      \ anything, you don\u2019t have anything to say, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily\
      \ work that way. Those that are quiet are sometimes just waiting for a gap in\
      \ the conversation. They\u2019re waiting to be invited to speak.\r\n\r\nWith\
      \ all this said, I\u2019ve got a tiny little speck of an idea. I\u2019d love\
      \ to hear what you guys have created or are working on \u2013 especially those\
      \ of you who aren\u2019t usually comfortable promoting your work. If you send\
      \ me a short paragraph about a creative project you\u2019re working on, I\u2019\
      ll compile them on my blog (same domain as my email address) for all of you\

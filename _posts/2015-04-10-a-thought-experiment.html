      --Karl Ove Knausgaard, My Struggle: Book One\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThat thought\
      \ you just had, or the one you\u2019re having right now, or the one you\u2019\
      ll have in the next instant\u2014how do each of these thoughts that float across\
      \ your conscious mind come into existence? It\u2019s instinctual to believe\
      \ that we author our own thoughts; that each of us has \u201Cfree will\u201D\
      \ and thus can choose to think whatever it is we want to think at any moment\
      \ in time.\r\n\r\nBut what if this was not true?\r\n\r\nWhat if free will was\
      \ merely an illusion? What if the feeling that we were the conscious authors\
      \ of the inner narrative of our minds, was only that: a feeling? And that instead,\
      \ those things we interpret as conscious thoughts were in fact the result of\
      \ biological, chemical and physical forces beyond our control and simply the\
      \ product of the same laws of nature and probability that govern every other\
      \ part of the universe? What then? How might we view our place in the world\
      \ differently if that were the case?\r\n\r\nFirst off, some might consider it\
      \ a bleak truth. Where is the romance in relegating all human thought and creativity\
      \ and action to cold unalterable probability functions collapsing around us\
      \ at every instant, bringing possibility into reality without our say? Rather\
      \ than bleak, I tend to think of this idea as staggeringly beautiful. To think\
      \ of our minds as mere envelopes of the universe expressing itself through us\
      \ is one way of conceiving of all of humanity, not to mention all of space and\
      \ time, as irrevocably connected in a way that is deeply spiritual without needing\
      \ to invoke the notion of god or religious doctrine or science fiction to get\
      \ there.\r\n\r\nSecond, if all of the thoughts we have, both good and bad, are\
      \ games of chance resolving themselves at every moment in time, then we might\
      \ think twice about how we cast judgment on others. We might do well to reign\
      \ in our deification of the individuals\u2014the artists, the musicians, the\
      \ inventors\u2014who create and do good things (those who have \"good\" thoughts)\
      \ and reconsider how we look down upon the fallen\u2014the criminals, the troubled,\
      \ the lazy\u2014who fail to do good or actively do harm (those who have \"bad\"\
      \ thoughts). We might choose to celebrate more communally the accomplishments\
      \ of the few and to exercise more compassion towards the (apparent) errors of\
      \ the many. Removing the illusion of free will deflates the primacy of the individual,\
      \ which, in turn grants us the opportunity to inflate our regard for the other.\r\
      \n\r\nFinally, if our thoughts are ultimately outside our control, we might\
      \ grow a deeper appreciation for the outsized role chance plays in determining\
      \ the course of our lives from beginning to end. No one would question the fact\
      \ that chance entirely dictates the parents to which we are born. Nor is it\
      \ controversial to suggest that nature and nurture thenceforth determine the\
      \ people we become, exactly to the extent they influence the choices we, as\
      \ individuals, are free to make. But if (as we\u2019re presuming here) we\u2019\
      re not actually truly free in making those choices, then nature and nurture\
      \ alone, not ourselves, dictate\u2014entirely!\u2014our makeup, down to every\

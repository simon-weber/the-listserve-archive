      <p>It''s been more than a year, I still don''t know how to deal with it and
      I don''t know if I will ever be. Because it still hurts. I still feel the pain.
      A lot of pain. </p>

      <p>He was the most amazing, kind-hearted man I have ever known. And definitely
      was my biggest fan. </p>

      <p>No farewell words were spoken, no time to say goodbye. It happened so quickly,
      I didn''t think it was real. </p>

      <p>I miss his laugh.</p>

      <p>I miss his hugs.</p>

      <p>I miss everything about him, even his stinky socks.</p>

      <p>My heart still aches in sadness, because the reason for losing him will never
      be known. But, I know in my heart that you are there, protecting and guiding
      me through. </p>

      <p>Until we meet again.</p>

      <p>You are forever in my heart. I love you.</p>

      \ I got to attend a private university at state-school prices.\r\n\r\nLuck:\
      \ When planning my final year of college, I was a little ahead in my coursework,\
      \ so I had a choice. I could either overload a bit more and graduate a semester\

      \ fun. I chose the latter, and got a year of Japanese study in. Why not? I was\
      \ watching a lot of anime at the time. How was I to know that the opportunity\
      \ would arise to become an English teacher in Japan? I didn\u2019t even have\
      \ to pay for the flight!\r\n\r\nAfter a year, the owner of the school I was\
      \ teaching at died. His inheritor planned to close the school; it hadn't been\
      \ earning much. I'd have to find a new job. Bad luck! Or so it seemed. I'd always\
      \ dreamt of flight, so on a whim I wrote the Army and asked if it was possible\
      \ for a civilian of no particular qualifications to become a helicopter pilot.\
      \ Turns out the answer is yes3!\r\n\r\nIf you want to exhibit luck, the Army\

      \ of course, if the Army hadn't taken me to Germany, I would never have met\
      \ my wife.\r\n\r\nSuffice it to say, she's the biggest example of good luck\

    \n\r\nOk.. first of all, I don't want to come off as a freak that keeps a dog\
    \ in my fanny pack & has to show you pics till your eyes bleed. I simply want\
    \ to share an experience that I had with a particular dog that will have forever\
    \ changed my life. & no offense if you do keep your dog in our purse/man purse,\
    \ just as long as the dog is healthy & happy no beef with me. But I do find I\
    \ get along with most animals better than most people, me thinks,...  I need to\
    \ Bark at the Moon.\r\n\r\n I come from a large ranch in So. Texas. We had so\
    \ many dogs, all sorts of breeds, some of the Shepherds we had will always live\
    \ in my heart, somewhere. However It has been just over a month since my Wife\
    \ & I put down my most impressive companion of 13 years, my Greatest of Danes,\
    \ Akasha. So few dogs truly have near genius intellect. As a fresh pup I only\
    \ had to show her, her the accidents twice, before she was at the door! Then I\
    \ noticed at a very young age of some 50 days that she'd look in the direction\
    \ of what I was focusing my eyes on when giving her commands. Soon she wouldn't\
    \ let me leave the house without a defiant F*** You bark. As far as she was concerned,\
    \ if i was suiting to go to mars, she expected there to be a perfectly Great Dane\
    \ shaped space suit. I'm not saying even the average dog isn't incredibly resourceful\
    \ & smart. But once & again a dog comes into your life & you come to realize that,\
    \ the Noble creature is so much a companion & truly needs to attend to your needs.\
    \ The very definition of man's best friend. She was nothing short of the finest\
    \ of Canine Ambassadors to the Human Race. (& gave the finest and most plentiful\
    \ of HUGS)  It was my honor to make the last year of her life, unforgettable on\
    \ her good days & cared for her every need on the bad. She never slept on the\
    \ ground in her life, even when we backpacked, & because of this she had never\
    \ had a callous, anywhere. I took the best care of her, as she took amazing care\
    \ of me as well as several of the people so close to me, like a Mother. I know\
    \ that Akasha would want me to set her ashes on the mantle & find myself a new\
    \ best friend. Creatures comprised of such intense love & kindness can never die,\
    \ she was in her life an old soul. I can only be most thankful that we were able\
    \ to lay her to rest in the best possible manner here at our home. In foresight\
    \ 13 years on a Great Dane is 91 in human years. Now I see it getting cold & I\
    \ am a bit thankful she isn't suffering through it, it would've been one hard\
    \ winter for her. So I can only hope that we allowed her to pass with dignity\
    \ & love.  I truly won the lotto when I picked her as a pup, & I hope I win the\
    \ doggie lotto again :P. Truthfully, I could have an enormous amount of money\

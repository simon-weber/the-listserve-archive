    body: "I was born on Prince of Wales Island, Alaska. Six months later, I died.\r\
      \n\r\nI contracted Spinal Meningitis when I was six months old. I had a really\
      \ high fever and eventually my body gave out. We lived in a logging camp called\
      \ Coffman Cove in south east Alaska, only accessible by sea plane or boat. Another\
      \ child brought the bug from the Seattle airport and didn't survive. I died\
      \ on the emergency plane ride to Ketchikan, Alaska. The co-pilot grabbed me\
      \ and resuscitated me.\r\n\r\nWhenever people hear that I lived in Alaska they\
      \ inevitably ask how I survived all the snow and cold. Alaska is HUGE, and isn't\
      \ all ice and snow. South East Alaska doesn't get nearly as much snow as people\
      \ think; it is actually a temperate rainforest. Ketchikan receives on average\
      \ 137 inches of precipitation a year, over 11 feet.\r\n\r\nThat much rain makes\
      \ the island of Prince of Wales one of the most beautiful places I have been.\
      \  The landscape and wildlife are unbelievable.  The only large mammals on the\
      \ island are black bear and Sitka blacktail deer.  The Prince of Wales flying\
      \ squirrel is found nowhere else.\r\n\r\nI grew up in this wild landscape and\
      \ I also moved a lot as a child. I ended up attending 13 schools, lived in 5\
      \ states and I don't know how many houses. Unfortunately I don't have any visuals\
      \ from anywhere that I have lived. I can't tell you about my bedrooms, schools,\
      \ teachers, or friends. I believe due to the high fever associated with spinal\
      \ meningitis, when I close my eyes I can't visualize. I read somewhere that\
      \ less than 1% of the population can't visualize. It is difficult to explain\
      \ how this affects my life. But one of the biggest problems I deal with is people's\
      \ faces and memories of locations. My memories aren't pictures in my mind. I\
      \ can't see what my mother, spouse or child look like when I close my eyes.\
      \ One way that I combat my visualization problems is to label everything in\
      \ my mind. I use words to describe what everything looks like and I label it\
      \ in my mind. This isn't a perfect solution but it does help.\r\n\r\nBecause\
      \ of my word-oriented brain, I have always been fascinated with acquiring language.\
      \ When I was young I read about feral children, children isolated from human\
      \ contact. They have little or no experience of human care, behavior, or, of\
      \ human language. Since that day I have wondered what happens if you do not\
      \ have a language. Can you even think? Think about something-you are talking\
      \ in your head. How would you do that without language? Would it just be images?\
      \ What would happen with a brain like mine-empty of images and never having\
      \ words to use?\r\n\r\nI left the island and returned throughout my childhood-\
      \ moving away for good in 1993 with little stored in my mind to remember the\
      \ place. But my father lived on the island for most of his life. He was basically\
      \ a hermit. He logged from when he was 18 years old and retired in his late\
      \ fifties. My father passed away a few years ago and left my brother and I some\
      \ cabins and land. We now rent them out. I went back to the island when he died\
      \ to tie up the loose ends. I took tons of pictures. Now my collection of photos\
      \ is my visual memory so I don't have to rely on my labels so much anymore.\r\

  body: "I will always remember being about the age of six on the train in England\
    \ with my family and looking down the aisle behind me to see a little boy about\
    \ my age in a row of seats all by himself with a backpack. The train started to\
    \ move and I looked back again to see that still, no one was with him. He was\
    \ riding the train alone. Later he pulled out a string cheese snack and with great\
    \ intent pealed a little strand down to the bottom but not all the way off, so\
    \ that it was hanging there, dangling. He preceded repeat this until the snack\
    \ was now transformed into a dangling squid which he bounced around in the air\
    \ as if acting out some skit. Every time I eat string cheese since seeing this\
    \ boy alone on the train I go through the same motions of transforming my snack\
    \ into a squid and while doing so I think about that little boy. I like to think\
    \ he was running away, starting a life free of the structure of family, school,\
    \ society\u2026 I will always see myself as that little boy, a kid running away\
    \ from the world with just his imagination to keep him company.\r\n\r\nI have\
    \ experienced a huge amount in the past year. I have no doubt in my mind that\
    \ it began when I started to believe in myself. I truly believe now that you create\
    \ your own luck and that it all begins with your mental state.\r\n\r\nImagine\
    \ wearing a small stylish piece of technology on your head that can record your\
    \ mental state throughout the day: happy, depressed, frustrated, engaged, etc.\
    \ Now imagine at the end of each day you could search for the happiest moment\
    \ you experienced and re-live it by playing back the point of view video that\
    \ the same device captured. Imagine your doctor has diagnosed you with clinical\
    \ depression and you are able to search through your mental state data for the\
    \ moments you experienced the most depression and view the video of the minutes\
    \ prior to determine factors that could be triggering this. Imagine using EEG\
    \ to interface with heads up display technology like Google Glass and you will\
    \ be imagining my dream of the technology I hope to bring to the world. I will\
    \ be spending my summer in the Orlando, Florida area developing EEG and Eye Tracking\
    \ software for a company looking to break into the NeuroMarketing field. My first\
    \ steps towards realizing this dream.\r\n\r\nStephen Swartz has been a friend\
    \ of mine since high school and I have not since met anyone with more pure talent\
    \ than himself. We studied percussion together and I was consistently blown away\
    \ by his musical prowess on any instrument as well as his improvisational creativity.\
    \ In this day and age when it seems like we are being overwhelmed with new music\

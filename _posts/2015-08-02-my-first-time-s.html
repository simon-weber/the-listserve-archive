      m about to drop an F-bomb on you!  Feminist!  Yes, I am a feminist and I\u2019\
      m not afraid to use that word! Wow!\r\n\r\nI realize that now is probably the\
      \ best time for me to be a woman in the grand scheme of civilization (mind you,\
      \ I live in the United States, so that statement is rather specific to this\

      \ (which I\u2019m eternally grateful for), we feel the pressure to take ALL\
      \ OF THEM.  Not only do we need to continue our roles as wives and mothers,\
      \ but we should also be running five separate companies while looking like a\
      \ supermodel all without losing our cool.  That\u2019s great if you\u2019re\
      \ into all that, but sometimes I just want to watch Netflix and eat cinnamon\
      \ rolls for dinner like a normal person.\r\n\r\nThen there\u2019s the whole\
      \ concept that we need to be super chill because any semblance of feelings in\
      \ a potential relationship means that we\u2019re nuts.  I spent way too many\
      \ months letting an ex-boyfriend treat me poorly and feeling horrible about\
      \ myself because I thought telling him that he shouldn\u2019t wait two days\
      \ to text me back meant that I was a clingy, psychotic girlfriend.  People,\
      \ communicating your feelings to another human being does not make you crazy.\
      \  It makes you a rational person that has confidence in his/her thoughts and\

      \ my hand or pocket.  No, let me rephrase that \u2013 heaven forbid I even say\
      \ the word tampon.  TAMPONTAMPONTAMPON.  This taboo irks me to no end. Sorry,\
      \ this is a side effect of my ability to FURTHER THE HUMAN RACE and that makes\
      \ society uncomfortable? (Sidenote: the expense of pads and tampons in the developing\
      \ world is a real hindrance to the education of women and contributes to an\
      \ increased incidence of HIV.  If you\u2019re interested in that, check out\

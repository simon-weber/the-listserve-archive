    body: "I dated a girl in Canada for less than six months back in 2006. I still\
      \ think about her all the time. I\u2019m not sure if that has as much to do\
      \ with her as it does with who I was at the time. I want to be that guy again.\r\
      \n\r\nBefore that, I dated a girl, on and off, for about five years, maybe more.\
      \ Neither of us was very serious about it, or so I thought. She made a point\
      \ of telling me I wasn\u2019t the one she was looking for, but in retrospect,\
      \ I think she said that because she knew I felt that way. I think she felt more\
      \ for me than I did and I wish I\u2019d been mature enough at the time to see\
      \ how wonderful she was to me. I still think about her a lot, and feel quite\
      \ a bit of affection for her. She was a really good person. I think she\u2019\
      s happy now, and that makes me feel a little better.\r\n\r\nDuring a longer\
      \ break with the girl above, I had a short relationship with a girl who had\
      \ two kids. They took me into their lives quickly and I became part of theirs.\
      \ I enjoyed playing the family man, the surrogate dad, I could see myself staying\
      \ there. I like to tell myself that I backed away because of her politics; she\
      \ was far to the right of me, and her job as a police officer had made her,\
      \ frankly, somewhat of a racist. The truth, however, is that I left her because\
      \ she had a literal mountain of debt, and I knew that if I married her I was\
      \ also marrying the debt.\r\n\r\nAt some point in all this I dated a girl who\
      \ cheated on me. She was heavily into bondage, apparently just not with me.\r\
      \n\r\nGoing back even further, I was married for ten years to a girl I met in\
      \ college. It was enjoyable, although we argued too much. We kept finding reasons\
      \ not to have any kids; money, jobs\u2026 that was for the best I guess. Things\
      \ worked out for her, she remarried, had a kid, and seems happy.\r\n\r\nCurrently\
      \ though, I\u2019m staring down the barrel of 50, and married to a woman who\
      \ hates me. I\u2019m too fat, I don\u2019t make enough money, and I\u2019m mean.\
      \ I\u2019m sad, she\u2019s always angry. I\u2019m not sure what we\u2019re going\
      \ to do, maybe we\u2019ll get divorced. I\u2019m trying to get in better shape,\
      \ make more money, be nicer\u2026 the last thing bothers me because none of\
      \ the women above ever thought I was mean. Even after breaking up I remained\
      \ quite cordial, if not downright friendly, with all of them (the cheater excluded).\r\
      \n\r\nI still love my wife despite her feelings towards me, and hope that we\
      \ can patch this thing back together. We do have two small children. I\u2019\
      m twisted up over the idea of a divorce, but I do know that if my wife and I\
      \ can\u2019t repair the relationship, a divorce may actually be the better solution\
      \ for the children.\r\n\r\nNo, I don\u2019t need any advice, not attaching an\

      \ dear friends on the LISTSERVE, is going to be less of a life-story but more\
      \ of a meandering thread-of-thought where I try to get my thoughts straight\
      \ (as straight as they can be, anyway) and just tell you about myself because\
      \ hey, why not, right?\r\n\r\nAbout where I'm going to go from here, currently,\
      \ my desire is to go to university, but then again, I don't really know what\
      \ I want to study. Maybe Landscaping Architecture? I was thinking of gene-technology,\
      \ but then realized that I'm not good enough at math to get into that. We'll\
      \ see about that!\r\n\r\nA thing I've gotten very much into lately, though,\
      \ is volunteering. It started with the Tallinn Old Town days, continued on with\
      \ the Circus Tree festival, a festival celebrating modern circus, and now is\
      \ going to continue on with a few more things during the autumn (two according\
      \ to plan currently, but that might yet change), and hopefully the OTD & CT\
      \ again next summer. I do hope I have time for them then, because working for\
      \ money is rad, but there's something about the fun of volunteering & the company\
      \ you have & the things you get to do that got me hooked on it.\r\n\r\nPlus,\
      \ free shirts. If they're well-designed, new shirts are always a very welcome\
      \ thing.\r\n\r\nBut about what I want to do next year/what i want to do after\
      \ high school/what I want to do with the rest of my life?\r\n\r\nI have absolutely\
      \ no clue, to be honest!\r\n\r\nThat's kinda what makes it fun, even though\
      \ not knowing can get very stressful at times.\r\n\r\nAs for who I am...\r\n\
      \r\nThat's always very strange to try and word about -- you could also say that\
      \ I'm still figuring that out too, since you yourself are a constantly changing\
      \ & growing as a person & change is a thing that's good not to be afraid of,\
      \ although it can seem terrifying sometimes.\r\n\r\nSo, about me, here are some\
      \ of my general likes -\r\n\r\nI love Naomi Novik's \"Temeraire\" series, it\
      \ has been my favourite book series for a few years now -- it's essentially\
      \ the Napoleon Wars, but with some added dragons. I love it. I still haven't\
      \ gotten to read Blood of Tyrants and can't wait until I actually get the chance\
      \ to buy it. I even bought it as an e-book because I got some google money at\
      \ some point, but then my phone screen broke and reading on my phone just wasn't\
      \ that pleasant anymore. Oh well, in some ways I'm kinda excited to actually\
      \ get the paper-version, especially since I have the rest of the (paperback)\
      \ books sitting on my shelf.\r\n\r\nA friend got me into the Percy Jackson books,\
      \ and they're fairly good, too! The characters and plot are interesting and...\
      \ tbh I kinda forgot that I still haven't finished the first book of the second\
      \ PJ series (Heroes of Olympus) because I've just gotten... distracted. My attention-span\
      \ works like that sometimes.\r\n\r\nI also love Welcome to Night Vale, what\
      \ a delightful podcast -- the other week I realized I've been a listening to\
      \ it for at least 3 years now, and I think that's really cool.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\

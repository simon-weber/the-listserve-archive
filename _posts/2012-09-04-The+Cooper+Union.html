<p>"My story today is not my own: it is Peter Cooper&#8217;s.  He died in 1883, but his legacy is just as important now as it was then.  He believed that education is a public good - that it should be available to anyone, regardless of their ability to pay, gender, race, religion, social class, or political beliefs.  This may not seem like a huge thing now, but it was then.</p>
<p>The reason I bring it up now is because the institution he founded, The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, is in trouble.  It has been a full-scholarship college for art, architecture, and engineering students since 1902 but it will run out of money in 2015 unless it gets significant help.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not soliciting donations (I doubt there are a lot of rogue billionaires on this list anyway. . .) but I would like you to take 10 seconds to Google &#8220;Cooper Union&#8221; and learn about Peter Cooper&#8217;s dream for education.  It has become my dream as well (I&#8217;ve taught there since 2009) and it makes me sad that its future is in jeopardy."</p>

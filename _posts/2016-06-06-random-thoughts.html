      \n\r\nThere\u2019s so much I want to write! Here\u2019s some random tidbits\
      \ about me:\r\n\r\nThroughout my time as a Board Certified Music Therapist,\
      \ I have worked primarily with children and adults with special needs on learning\
      \ musical instruments. I have taught music theory, guitar, piano, trumpet, saxophone,\
      \ and recorder in MANY different ways. I have taught music with color or lettered\
      \ notation, created silly sentences to fit into beats, created hundreds of visual\
      \ aides, etc. all with one goal: to make each client I work with feel successful.\r\
      \n\r\nI live by the idea that every single person on this planet interprets\
      \ the world around them differently.\r\n\r\nI randomly picked up an audiobook\
      \ a few months back from the library. It was my first one, and I was unsure\
      \ of how well I would be able to follow an entire book while driving. I\u2019\
      m in my car a lot for work, so I figured it was worth a try. I have always loved\
      \ to read, but I typically have problems with reading comprehension. I was amazed\
      \ with how well I was able to retain the contents of the audiobooks. They have\
      \ rejuvenated my passion for reading and (almost) make driving in New Jersey\
      \ tolerable. I\u2019m now on my 18th audiobook and I\u2019d love some recommendations!\r\
      \n\r\nI love my two children more than anything in the world, but I have come\
      \ to the conclusion that it is okay to sometimes wonder why I willingly decided\
      \ to have tiny freeloaders living with me.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m starting graduate\
      \ school in the fall. I still can\u2019t determine whether this is an amazing\
      \ or absolutely insane idea. If any of you have gone back to school as a parent,\
      \ I\u2019d really like to know your secrets to success!\r\n\r\nI love really\
      \ horrible movies. One of my recent favorites has been \u201CChopping Mall.\u201D\
      \r\n\r\nMy favorite movie of all time is \u201CXanadu.\u201D Olivia Newton John,\
      \ ELO, AND Gene Kelly? You can\u2019t go wrong!\r\n\r\nI have a black lab/hound\
      \ dog named Rainbow. We adopted him when I was feeling the call of mother nature\

    body: "One of the most important, inspirational, and meaningful sayings I live\
      \ by is: \"all you need is love\u201D. I am  24 and a recent half graduated\
      \ university student. I\u2019m obsessed with chocolate and my favourite book\
      \ is \u201CBrave New World\u201D. I've experienced many terrible and many beautiful\
      \ things in the past few years. However I have been fortunate enough to experience\
      \ falling in love...two and a half times...I say two and a half because two\
      \ people I know I love and the half\u2026well you\u2019ll see.\r\n\r\nThe first\
      \ love was extraordinary. We were together for about a year and a half. He taught\
      \ me many things that in turn allowed me to grow tremendously as a person. He\
      \ was also there for me throughout my hardest years of life. During 2011, over\
      \ the span of 6 months, 5 young people I know passed away. I was a complete\
      \ fucking wreck and naturally this weakened the progression of a healthy relationship.\
      \ A few years after these tragedies, and the inevitable crumble of this relationship,\
      \ I was reminiscing about my former love. I wondered: why the fuck did things\
      \ turn out this way...? I will never forget what my Mum (I love my Mum...probably\
      \ much more than she even knows) said to me: \"It wasn't meant to be and that's\
      \ ok! You know why? Because just by him being present he was doing so much good\
      \ for you. He was there for you through those difficult moments. He helped you\
      \ get through that terrible time and that was the purpose for him being a part\
      \ of your life...to help you.\"  - Thank you first love; I don't know if I ever\
      \ said that to you...\r\n\r\nThe second love... We met a few years ago during\
      \ what I like to refer to as the most ridiculous cake incident I've ever been\
      \ a part of. Picture a two person cake fight amongst a 50 person booze filled\
      \ slop show birthday party. The cake fight ended with us two cake-covered people\
      \ cleaning ourselves up and during the process flooding a bathroom using a bidet.\
      \ Naturally we headed out to the \"hottest\" nightclub with cake bits still\
      \ crusted all over...we ended the night with ... well I'll leave that to your\
      \ imagination. I was fortunate to spend the rest of the year getting into many\
      \ other crazy shenanigans with him. Sadly he graduated and headed to the other\
      \ side of the country. However a few months later, during the adult version\
      \ of Disneyland: Shambhala Music Festival, (in Salmo BC...if you get a chance\
      \ go...it's truly life changing) our paths crossed again. As time has it things\
      \ came to an end and we both returned to our separate lives...Although not before\
      \ spending one more week together.\r\n\r\nThe half love is interesting. We met\
      \ at the beginning of this past summer. I can whole heartedly tell each one\
      \ of you that I have never in my life experienced a stronger connection with\
      \ a stranger....ever. We met briefly and months later we met again... coincidentally\
      \ at another music festival. Every time we saw each other it was as though a\
      \ strong cosmic energy pulled us together. It was some magical. I distinctly\
      \ remember a moment where we gazed into each others eyes for a solid 30 seconds....that's\
      \ a feat...try it with someone sometime; it's a wonderful feeling. Afterwards\
      \ we continuously seemed to see each other in odd places around the city. It\
      \ was nice, however, I soon left the city on soul pilgrimage across the country....\
      \ yet not before finding out he too would be at this year\u2019s Shambhala Music\
      \ Festival.\r\n\r\nI travelled around the states and Canada en route to Beautiful\
      \ BC. When I arrived \"home\" I had a very odd feeling that half love would\
      \ not be in attendance. I was right...actually a friend had purchased his ticket\
      \ last minute. The universe is interesting in these regards because guess which\
      \ love was there? Love number two. It was the first time we had seen each other\
      \ in a year...and it was beautiful. Everything between us fell right back into\
      \ place. Following the festival we were fortunate to be able to spend yet another\
      \ week together. When he left I could barely speak\u2026all I could muster up\
      \ were copious amounts of tears.\r\n\r\nIt is so important to share love and\
      \ appreciation with people. Love is the most beautiful part of life. I want\
      \ you to know that no matter what or where you are there is love in your life.\
      \ Love can be found in the Earth's energy, within yourself, in the smile of\
      \ a stranger, the embrace of someone special, and even in the most painful of\
      \ situations. Trust that the universe has the best path for you\u2026so follow\
      \ your heart and follow your feet!\r\n\r\nI would definitely be interested in\
      \ hearing your stories of love, helpful tips on grieving, meditation advice,\
      \ places to do yoga, and any advice on how to make it in Event and Promotion\
      \ Marketing!\r\n\r\nTo each of you I send a bit of loving energy and I hope\
      \ that you will always tell them how you feel <3\r\n\r\n\r\nTaylor\r\ntmchance@hotmail.com\r\

      I never thought this day would come. Anyways, I really just want to share what
      I&#8217;ve learned this summer. I am a university student and I stayed at school
      for the summer. As a person who believes that there is a purpose in everything,
      I was wondering exactly what that was. I knew two things: I wanted to recover

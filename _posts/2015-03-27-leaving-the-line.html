      \ last night I was in a caf\xE9, sharing my most inner thoughts with an acquaintance\
      \ from high school who I hadn\u2019t seen in a while. We were inspired by a\
      \ \u201Csocial study\u201D that we read about in the NY Times, titled To Fall\
      \ in Love With Anyone, Do This. In the study, two strangers are placed in a\
      \ room and ask each other a series of increasingly personal questions. We decided\
      \ to try it out for ourselves.\r\n\r\nTwo enlightening & emotional hours later,\
      \ we reached the final question of the study:\r\n\r\n\u2018Share a personal\
      \ problem and ask your partner\u2019s advice on how he or she might handle it.\u2019\
      \r\n\r\nI felt a lump in my throat grow as I tried to verbalize the thoughts\
      \ whose only other location have been at the back of my mind.\r\n\r\n\u201C\
      I think I have a good life\u2026 and for the most part I do what I want that\
      \ makes me happy\u2026 but it feels like there\u2019s always something in my\
      \ brain that feels\u2026 trapped. It\u2019s telling me to do more, explore more,\
      \ be more\u2026I almost feel like I can\u2019t breathe\u2026but I don\u2019\
      t know what to do about it.\u201D\r\n\r\nMy heart raced in fear of expressing\
      \ so much vulnerability. He gave me a quite notable response, as follows:\r\n\
      \r\nI see life like a nightclub. There\u2019s the main entrance, where you wait\
      \ in line, along with 99% of the other people trying to get into the club, and\
      \ hope that the bouncer chooses you to get in. The second entrance is for privileged\
      \ people, who get in because they\u2019re celebrities etc. What most people\
      \ don\u2019t realize is that there\u2019s a third way inside\u2026\r\n\r\nThe\
      \ third way is leaving the long line and running through the alley, banging\
      \ on the back door, sneaking through the windows, doing anything you can to\
      \ enter.  The scariest part; however, is not going through this unfamiliar territory,\
      \ but rather leaving the main line that you have already been waiting in for\
      \ so long.\r\n\u2026\r\n\r\nThe main entrance is the line that I have been in\
      \ my entire life, and it seems most of society is there too.\r\n\r\nI am a 21-year-old\
      \ business student, and until recently, I have been in this line- waiting patiently\

      respectable\u201D internship for the summer that would turn into a practical\
      \ full time job, graduating school on time, and having my career laid out for\
      \ me. That\u2019s true happiness\u2026 right?\r\nI am slowly learning that the\
      \ \u201CI\u2019m trapped\u201D voice in the back of my head doesn\u2019t believe\

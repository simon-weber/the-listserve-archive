      <p>Today I''m going to introduce you to a word you may not have heard before:
      mokita.</p>

      <p>A mokita is &#8220;the truth we all know but agree not to talk about". In
      English, the concept is maybe best rendered as "the elephant in the room".</p>

      <p>Some examples of mokitas in the modern United States:</p>

      <p>* Nearly half of our citizens didn''t vote, period, for their President.<br
      />* The Democratic party, as per policy, scuttled their best populist candidate.<br
      />* The Republican party, as per *their* policy, let a probable narcissist and
      definite political neophyte become their candidate.<br />* It is cripplingly
      expensive to get healthcare, especially on short notice, without insurance--and
      even then, it gets more expensive every year.</p>

      <p>I''m not going to rag on politics, though, since that''s old news. Let''s
      talk business, specifically software. Let''s talk about some mokitas.</p>

      <p>I''m a software developer by profession. I don''t say software *engineer*,
      because engineering in most places is a protected term--you have to be accredited,
      you have to be licensed, you have to have some baseline level of ethics and
      professionalism.</p>

      <p>==&gt; Mokita: Software development is not even close to a mature engineering
      field, and won''t be for a long time. &lt;===</p>

      <p>Every day I sit down at a computer writing rules to help automatically turn
      one set of data (say, sales data) into another (say, profit estimates). I do
      this by asking questions and writing down special cases. I do this by explaining
      to my dog what the program is supposed to do and catching myself misstating

      <p>That''s what some people call their jobs. What they call their life''s work,

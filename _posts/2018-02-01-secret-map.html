      \nI'd love to hear how reading this went for you!\r\n\r\nThe excerpt:\r\n\r\n\
      Eika slept with a sturdy snore that cranked snot in and out of her nostrils.\
      \ She slept sprawled in the dark-orange chair in her father's office. Her dreams\
      \ felt big and wide in her head. She grew to be a violent wizard, shooting solid\
      \ bricks from her fingers to replace the heads of nonbelievers.\r\n\r\nIn real\
      \ life she lifted her left hand up into the air and twirled it around as she\
      \ slept. In dream life she was creating a tornado.\r\n\r\nThe door to the office\
      \ was wide open. Fullerton's head was sideways, his eyes and forehead poking\
      \ around the right side of the door frame.\r\n\r\nFullerton made his eyes big,\
      \ the size that secrets get when they hurt.\r\n\r\nOn top of Eika's bag sat\
      \ something that Fullerton wanted to steal: a map.\r\nThe map was a circle,\
      \ with a circular hole cut out of the middle. It showed 3 trails, all of which\
      \ curved around in the visible area of the map, and disappeared in the center\
      \ hole.\r\n\r\nThe hole surrounded the lake near their town. Eika had found\
      \ this map near the dam that holds the lake in.\r\n\r\nThe map stayed in Eika's\
      \ notebook, which stayed in her backpack, which only left her body for eating\
      \ and sleeping, and her backpack always stayed on her back or at her feet.\r\
      \n\r\nFullerton almost fucked up when he whispered, \"\"she fucked up.\"\"\r\
      \n\r\nFullerton moved as slowly as he could. Fullerton practices this everyday.\
      \ Slow as he can, everyday, he walks in a loop around his house until Eika comes\
      \ over to ask if he can play.\r\n\r\nThis time, he barely moved an inch a minute,\
      \ and he's walking in Eika's direction.\r\n\r\nHis steps were sticky on the\
      \ tile floor near her chair, Eika spilled soda before she fell asleep.\r\n\r\
      \nTo reduce the noise of his shoes ripping up the molecules of the drying soda,\
      \ he took them off and walked on the side of his socked feet.\r\n\r\nIt took\
      \ ten minutes before Fullerton was close enough to take the map.\r\n\r\nHis\
      \ shaking hands moved toward her bag, toward the map, and he pinched the edge\
      \ of the map.\r\n\r\nHe lifted upwards slowly, softly, and felt a squeal fermenting\
      \ in his throat. He could barely breathe, his tongue got stuck to the dry roof\
      \ of his mouth.\r\n\r\nThe map was in his hands.\r\n\r\nThe map was in his hands\
      \ and he couldn't believe it and he had to get out of there and fast. \r\n\r\
      \nHe walked backwards slightly faster than before. Only slightly.\r\n\r\nHis\
      \ shoulder hit the door frame, then the back of his head, and it hurt so bad\
      \ he accidentally let a groan fall out of his throat.\r\n\r\nEika stirred, and\
      \ with eyes shut she made a confused moaning sound. Her dreaming had gone narrow\
      \ and constricting: she couldn't move. She watched Fullerton in a forest. She\
      \ saw a tree wiggling in the wind. The tree wiggled fast, falling toward Fullerton.\
      \ She tried to grab him, to pull him out of the way, but her dream muscles wouldn't\
      \ move.\r\n\r\nFullerton stopped. He watched Eika as she grieved his dream-life\

      like.<br />I''d love to hear how reading this went for you!</p>

      <p>The excerpt:</p>

      <p>Eika slept with a sturdy snore that cranked snot in and out of her nostrils.
      She slept sprawled in the dark-orange chair in her father''s office. Her dreams
      felt big and wide in her head. She grew to be a violent wizard, shooting solid
      bricks from her fingers to replace the heads of nonbelievers.</p>

      <p>In real life she lifted her left hand up into the air and twirled it around
      as she slept. In dream life she was creating a tornado.</p>

      <p>The door to the office was wide open. Fullerton''s head was sideways, his
      eyes and forehead poking around the right side of the door frame.</p>

      <p>Fullerton made his eyes big, the size that secrets get when they hurt.</p>

      <p>On top of Eika''s bag sat something that Fullerton wanted to steal: a map.<br
      />The map was a circle, with a circular hole cut out of the middle. It showed
      3 trails, all of which curved around in the visible area of the map, and disappeared
      in the center hole.</p>

      <p>The hole surrounded the lake near their town. Eika had found this map near
      the dam that holds the lake in.</p>

      <p>The map stayed in Eika''s notebook, which stayed in her backpack, which only
      left her body for eating and sleeping, and her backpack always stayed on her
      back or at her feet.</p>

      <p>Fullerton almost fucked up when he whispered, ""she fucked up.""</p>

      <p>Fullerton moved as slowly as he could. Fullerton practices this everyday.
      Slow as he can, everyday, he walks in a loop around his house until Eika comes
      over to ask if he can play.</p>

      <p>This time, he barely moved an inch a minute, and he''s walking in Eika''s
      direction.</p>

      <p>His steps were sticky on the tile floor near her chair, Eika spilled soda
      before she fell asleep.</p>

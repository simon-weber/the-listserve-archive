    body: "Hi! I\u2019m Julia. I\u2019ve been on the Listserve for almost four years\
      \ now, so it\u2019s about damn time I won the thing.\r\n\r\nA little about me:\
      \ I\u2019m 23. I live in NYC. I\u2019m a reporter at BuzzFeed, and I mostly\
      \ cover human interest news. I love dogs (obsessively), knitting (ineptly),\
      \ reading (everything, especially weird non-fiction), and going to concerts\
      \ (I\u2019ve seen Third Eye Blind thrice and counting).\r\n\r\nA few thoughts\
      \ on stuff:\r\n\r\n1.\tThe best part about my job is getting to interview everyday\
      \ people who do wonderful/funny things (e.g. a woman who is cosplaying through\
      \ cancer treatment, a 15-year-old girl who got her head stuck in a Barney mascot\
      \ head, the dad behind the \u201CCheerio Challenge\u201D, etc.). The worst part\
      \ is how mean the internet can be, and also today a guy on a dating app said\
      \ \u201Clol you should write a listicle about me.\u201D :/\r\n\r\n2.\tEvery\
      \ night/morning, I write in my \u201C5 Minute Journal.\u201D As someone who\
      \ always wanted to keep a journal but never kept it up, this thing is great.\
      \ Search Amazon, it\u2019s worth trying.\r\n\r\n3.\tSchool always made me think\
      \ I was a failure, which I think had less to do with my intelligence and more\
      \ to do with how we treat learning disabilities (especially in girls). I was\
      \ never formally diagnosed with a LD, but had at least one elementary school\
      \ teacher who I later found out had told my parents I should get tested. I never\
      \ was. I\u2019m doing OK now, but school was hard for me in ways it maybe didn\u2019\
      t have to be.\r\n\r\n4.\tI got half a boob job in high school because I had\
      \ severely asymmetrical boobs that really messed up my self image for most of\
      \ my life. I wrote an essay about it on BuzzFeed a couple months ago, which\
      \ was a HUGE deal for me after years of keeping it a shameful secret.\r\n\r\n\
      5. I\u2019m on Team Mystic (level 18), and my starter Pokemon is always and\
      \ forever Squirtle.\r\n\r\n6.\tMy circle of friends from college lost a few\
      \ people in the last 13 months. Untimely, sudden deaths of young people alter\
      \ your world in a way that cannot be undone. A little over a year later, I don\u2019\
      t know if I\u2019ve had any major EPIPHANIES, but the sheer knowledge of grief\
      \ has made me (and all of us) kinder and a bit more forgiving. It still feels\
      \ unfair. I think it always will.\r\n\r\n7.\tThe world is bit of a dumpster\
      \ fire lately, so everyone should register to vote!\r\n\r\n8.\tA few book suggestions:\
      \ Smoke Gets In Your Eyes, The Language Of Food, and my all time fave, Hitchhiker\u2019\
      s Guide To The Galaxy. I read this book every time I need it. It\u2019s like\
      \ meditating to me, at this point.\r\n\r\n9.\tMusic you should listen to: Chance\u2019\
      s newest mixtape. The newest Ariana Grande album (it is SO GOOD DO NOT START\
      \ WITH ME). Smoke and Ashes by Tracy Chapman. Third Eye Blind\u2019s cover of\
      \ Mine. Jojo's (yes that Jojo) cover of Marvin\u2019s Room. Coffee by Miguel.\
      \ Borne On The FM Waves Of The Heart by Against Me. Depending on when this email\
      \ comes out, Frank Ocean\u2019s new album. Hopefully.\r\n\r\nSay hi! Ask me\
      \ questions! Give me compliments! Send me pics of your dog!\r\n\r\nLove,\r\n\

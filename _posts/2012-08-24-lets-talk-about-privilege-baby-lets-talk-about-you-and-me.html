    <p>I was on the last leg of a road trip Friday, passing through El Paso on my
    way home to Austin.  Speeding along the highway, I looked across the Rio Grande
    and into Mexico.  It''s nothing but a river that draws the line between these
    two countries, but that river''s arbitrary contours divide wealth from poverty,
    safety from violence. It''s just a river, but there''s no question on which side
    you''d rather exist.</p>

    <p>Isn''t that dumb?  </p>

    <p>I''m baffled by how much things over which we have no control shape our lives.  Race,
    gender, national origin-- these characteristics are all determined by the roll
    of some metaphysical die before birth, and yet drastically affect our life experience.  For
    me, being white meant the border patrol agents in Arizona didn''t harass me. However,
    being a woman meant my heartbeat quickened when I walked past a group of men in
    an isolated part of Seattle.  </p>

    <p>We''re all assholes because we each possess certain unearned privileges that
    others don''t, and probably don''t reckon with that thought enough.  I highly
    recommend reading "White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack" by Peggy
    McIntosh and "The Male Privilege Checklist" by Barry Deutsch, if you haven''t.

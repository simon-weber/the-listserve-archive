<p>My favorite English professor taught me to write like Hemingway.  Few words and active verbs make perfect sentences. </p>
<p>Senior year, I had to write an essay, one conveying a sense of time and place, in the style of Joan Didion. Inspired by my respect for the professor and enthralled by Didion, I wrote a harshly honest account - my struggles with weight, food, responsibility - and anger at parental pressure. peer pressure and career pressure.   The title, "Often, That Problem Is Mine,"  referenced a joke between my friend Scott - also in the class - and me.  The totally awkward, poorly-constructed sentence summed up everything we wrote and thought about, while mocking the passive, unmanly writing styles we had certainly transcended.  </p>
<p>My professor gave me an A and encouraged me to publish it.  He seemed truly enthusiastic, convinced it would make a great op-ed in the New York Times.  </p>
<p>Lacking confidence, and still fearing parents' wrath, publishers' rejection and professional repudiation, I demurred, dodged and dropped the idea.</p>
<p>I failed to follow-through, and now I wonder what might have been.</p>
<p>Often, that problem is mine.  </p>

  body: "Hi Everyone!\r\n\r\nI'm using this email to share a few things I've been\
    \ thinking about a lot recently. One has to do with friendships. The others with\
    \ business. I'd love any thoughts you have on the topics.\r\n\r\nFirst, a bit\
    \ about me. I'm 22. From Cali. Went to Wharton in Pennsylvania. Dropped out to\
    \ start a company in New York that sold this spring. Worked briefly in India and\
    \ now I'm headed back to Wharton. I'm interested in most things.\r\n\r\nWith that,\
    \ here are the questions. Would love to hear from you.\r\n\t1.\tOn Friends \u2014\
    \ I have a bunch of longtime friends I've known since grade school who are like\
    \ family. We hang out a lot, but most of what we do is kill time \u2014 watch\
    \ movies, talk about sports (I don't watch sports), gossip, etc. How do I transition\
    \ the dynamic so that we start doing more productive activities together? (ie\
    \ reading, writing, drawing, making beer, taking dance lessons.) Do you do any\
    \ stuff like this with friends?\r\n\t2.\tOn jobs in the US \u2014 What will jobs\
    \ in the US be in the future, assuming manufacturing continues to move to Asia\
    \ and software continues to replace broker/admin/information jobs? Could it be\
    \ that there is no solution within the national-industrial-market economy framework\
    \ we've used the past 200 years? Do you see hints of an answer anywhere?\r\n\t\
    3.\tOn the US, China, and India \u2014 The writing is on the wall that India and\
    \ China will replace the US as the most important economically and politically\
    \ -- relegating the US to a Britain-like role of seniority or Japan-like role\
    \ of next best. Given that assumption, how do we capitalize as western business\
    \ people?\r\n\t4.\tOn culture \u2014 Being exposed to foreign cultures is so valuable\
    \ -- not for goodwill, though that too, but for helping people avoid narrow minded\
    \ thinking about how things should be.\_How do we get more people exposed? Most\
    \ people I know don't even leave the state they're born in. What if there were\
    \ a way to connect with someone your age, gender, and profession in another country\
    \ to chat?\L\r\n\t5.\tOn picking where you live \u2014 It seems to me that it\
    \ is statistically impossible that most people are born in the optimal city. I\
    \ think it's even more true as you get older that given your profession (banker,\
    \ watch maker?) and preferences (outdoors, cold?) and such that there is a more\
    \ optimal place you could be living. Why is it harder to find and move to a more\
    \ optimal city in say Canada, or any foreign country, than your own. Why don't\
    \ people shop for the right country? If you work on cars, wouldn't it make sense\
    \ to at least consider living in Italy or Germany?\r\n\r\nWould love to hear from\
    \ you!\r\n\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nHunter Horsley\r\n@hhorsley\r\nhunter.horsley@gmail.com\r\

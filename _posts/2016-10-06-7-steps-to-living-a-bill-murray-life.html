    body: "\"Hi from France all !\r\n\r\nWhen I read this article two years ago, I\
      \ thought \"\"If I win this listserve thing I just subscribed to, I need to\
      \ share this\"\". Why ? Because I love all the urban legends or stories behind\
      \ Bill Murray, how he crashed in parties of unknown people, drive a taxi or\
      \ sneak to steal two french fries and say \"\"no one will believe you\"\"\r\n\
      \r\nAlso because I don't have any life advice or highly though after theory.\
      \ I'm a 39 years old white male trying to understand and confront what are my\
      \ own privileges in this patriarcal society to help my daughter grow in a good\
      \ person understanding and getting rid of the limitations society will want\
      \ to throw at her.\r\n\r\nStep one to being more like Bill Murray: Sing. And\
      \ really be into it. Murray is not his ironic Saturday Night Live lounge singer\
      \ and he is not his Lost in Translation actor abroad, singing a half-asleep\
      \ version of \u201CMore Than This.\u201D He sings when the mood strikes him,\
      \ and when it does, he means it. As he walked out onstage on Friday night at\
      \ the Toronto Film Festival to the sounds of Prince\u2019s \u201CRaspberry Beret,\u201D\
      \ Murray grabbed a microphone and sang a few verses of the song. He would repeat\
      \ the performance (sans mike) at an after-party later that night, where he would\
      \ also lead a dance party, as he has been known to do in the past.\r\n\r\nFriday\
      \ was \u201CBill Murray Day\u201D at the festival, and it consisted of screenings\
      \ of Murray classics Stripes, Ghostbusters, and Groundhog Day, and the world\
      \ premiere of his new film, St. Vincent, in which he plays a grumpy old man\
      \ tasked with watching the child of his neighbor, played by Melissa McCarthy.\
      \ During the Q&A, moderated by Scrooged screenwriter Mitch Glazer, and featuring\
      \ Ghostbusters director Ivan Reitman, Murray dropped so many pieces of life\
      \ wisdom that it seemed only right to gather it into a Bill Murray Guide to\
      \ Life. (Copyright: us.)\r\n\r\nStep two to being more like Bill Murray: Just\
      \ be honest. The St. Vincent role came about, said Murray, \u201Cbecause they\
      \ couldn\u2019t get Jack Nicholson.\u201D After the audience roared in laughter,\
      \ he continued, \u201CNo really. It\u2019s well-documented.\u201D\r\n\r\nRelated\

      \ the Wild\r\nStep three: Always make time for your friends. On a day when all\
      \ of Toronto was celebrating him, and he had a full slate of press for St. Vincent,\
      \ Murray still carved out time to see Welcome To Me, an audaciously wacko comedy\
      \ about a woman with bipolar disorder (Kristen Wiig), who\u2019s obsessed with\
      \ Oprah, wins the lottery, and buys herself a talk show on a failing cable network.\
      \ It\u2019s the first film by Shira Piven, wife of Anchorman director Adam McKay,\
      \ and Will Ferrell is one of the producers. \u201CIt\u2019s one of the strangest\
      \ movies I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201D he said. \u201CThe bravery to make this\
      \ movie is pretty impressive. It\u2019s quite a piece of work. I mean, the funny\
      \ stuff is maybe bolder than anything we\u2019ve seen in a very, very long time.\
      \ And it\u2019s not just a funny movie. There\u2019s a lot going on. I\u2019\
      m still thinking about what happened.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\nStep four: Be spontaneous.\
      \ Many people are aware of Murray\u2019s penchant for popping in on random karaoke\
      \ nights, or doing dishes at other people\u2019s house parties, or crashing\
      \ wedding photo shoots. But this is not a new thing. According to Reitman, Murray\
      \ has always been that way. Back in the day, before he was ever on SNL, Murray\
      \ used to go up to people on the streets of New York and yell, \u201CWatch out,\
      \ there\u2019s a lobster loose, hot butter\u2019s the only way to get it!\u201D\
      \ in the voice he\u2019d later use in Caddyshack. \u201CHe\u2019s going up to\
      \ strangers in Manhattan and they\u2019re laughing. They don\u2019t know who\
      \ this guy is, but he\u2019s making them laugh, and he\u2019s totally spontaneous\
      \ and they just have to go with it.\u201D\r\n\r\nStep five: Leave yourself open\
      \ to magical moments. It\u2019s unclear how long ago this was, but Murray told\
      \ a tale of being in a cab in Oakland and finding out his cab driver was a saxophone\
      \ player. The driver, however, never got to practice because he drove 14 hours\
      \ a day. So when Murray also found out the guy\u2019s sax was in the trunk,\
      \ he had him pull over, get out his horn, sit in the back, and play while Murray\
      \ drove. \u201CYou know, that\u2019s like two and two. It makes four,\u201D\
      \ Murray said. \u201CNot only did he play all the way to Sausalito, which is\
      \ a long ways, but we stopped and got barbecue. He was playing at what people\
      \ would call a sketchy rib place in Oakland at like 2:15 in the morning. It\u2019\
      s like, \u2018Relax, man. You\u2019ve got the fucking horn. We\u2019re cool\
      \ here.\u2019 He\u2019s blowing the horn and the crowd\u2019s like, \u2018What\
      \ the hell\u2019s that crazy white dude playing that thing?\u2019 And it was\
      \ great. It made for a beautiful night. I think we\u2019d all do that, if you\
      \ saw that moment and you\u2019re, as we say, available, you\u2019d make the\
      \ connection and you\u2019d do it right.\u201D\r\n\r\nStep six: Stay relaxed\
      \ and success will follow. \u201CSomeone told me some secrets early on about\
      \ living. You have to remind yourself that you can do the very best you can\
      \ when you\u2019re very, very relaxed. No matter what it is, no matter what\
      \ your job is, the more relaxed you are, the better you are. That\u2019s sort\
      \ of why I got into acting. I realized that the more fun I had, the better I\
      \ did it, and I thought, Well, that\u2019s a job I can be proud of. I\u2019\
      d be proud to have that job, if I had to go to work and say, \u2018No matter\
      \ what my condition or what my mood is, no matter how I feel about what\u2019\
      s going on in my life, if I can relax myself and enjoy what I\u2019m doing and\
      \ have fun with it, then I can do my job really well.\u2019 And it\u2019s changed\
      \ my life, learning that. And it\u2019s made me better at what I do. I\u2019\
      m not the greatest or anything. But I really enjoy what I do.\u201D\r\n\r\n\
      Step seven: Remember that you are you and no one else is. The night\u2019s final\
      \ question was \u201CWhat\u2019s it like being you?\u201D Murray responded with\
      \ a guru-level reminder about the importance of being present, which we\u2019\
      ll reprint in full and embed in audio form below.\r\n\r\nI think if I\u2019\
      m gonna answer that question, because it is a hard question, I\u2019d like to\
      \ suggest that we all answer that question right now, while I\u2019m talking.\
      \ I\u2019ll continue. Believe me, I won\u2019t shut up. I have a microphone.\
      \ But let\u2019s all ask ourselves that question right now. What does it feel\
      \ like to be you? What does it feel like to be you? Yeah. It feels good to be\
      \ you, doesn\u2019t it? It feels good, because there\u2019s one thing that you\
      \ are \u2014 you\u2019re the only one that\u2019s you, right?. So you\u2019\
      re the only one that\u2019s you, and we get confused sometimes \u2014 or I do,\
      \ I think everyone does \u2014 you try to compete. You think, Dammit, someone\
      \ else is trying to be me. Someone else is trying to be me. But I don\u2019\
      t have to armor myself against those people; I don\u2019t have to armor myself\
      \ against that idea if I can really just relax and feel content in this way\
      \ and this regard. If I can just feel, just think now: How much do you weigh?\
      \ This is a thing I like to do with myself when I get lost and I get feeling\
      \ funny. How much do you weigh? Think about how much each person here weighs\
      \ and try to feel that weight in your seat right now, in your bottom right now.\
      \ Parts in your feet and parts in your bum. Just try to feel your own weight,\
      \ in your own seat, in your own feet. Okay? So if you can feel that weight in\
      \ your body, if you can come back into the most personal identification, a very\
      \ personal identification, which is: I am. This is me now. Here I am, right\
      \ now. This is me now. Then you don\u2019t feel like you have to leave, and\
      \ be over there, or look over there. You don\u2019t feel like you have to rush\
      \ off and be somewhere. There\u2019s just a wonderful sense of well-being that\
      \ begins to circulate up and down, from your top to your bottom. Up and down\
      \ from your top to your spine. And you feel something that makes you almost\
      \ want to smile, that makes you want to feel good, that makes you want to feel\
      \ like you could embrace yourself.\r\nSo what\u2019s it like to be me? You can\
      \ ask yourself, What\u2019s it like to be me? You know, the only way we\u2019\
      ll ever know what it\u2019s like to be you is if you work your best at being\
      \ you as often as you can, and keep reminding yourself: That\u2019s where home\
      \ is.\r\n\r\nAll credit to the text to Jada Yuan.\r\n\r\nFinally, I don't know\

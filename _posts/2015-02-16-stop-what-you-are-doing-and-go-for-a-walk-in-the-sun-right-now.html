      <p>1. Everyone has an opinion on how to be a teacher. Having been a student
      once doesn''t mean you know how to teach. Do you know how to make a medical
      diagnosis just because you''ve been to the doctor a few times? Nope.</p>

      <p>2. I think I work too much. I guess the grass is always greener but I can''t
      help but think that it''s not worth the time and effort I''m putting in. My
      work-life balance is totally out of balance. Am I overworked, or putting unnecessary
      pressure on myself or just not very efficient? Will it magically get better?
      Where do I even start to fix this?</p>

      <p>3. I''m making it up (in a responsible and educated way) as I go. Trial and
      error, folks.</p>

      <p>Now, in total contradiction to #1, I''d love your advice. Why was your favourite
      teacher your favourite? What does a good teacher do? If you are a teacher, what
      advice would you have wanted to hear when you were starting out? Hit me up with
      some wisdom!</p>

      <p>Thanks for reading. Looking forward to hearing back from some of you.<br

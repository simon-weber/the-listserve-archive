      \ in my life. I just hit the one-year mark of my first real career job. I\u2019\
      m in the industry that I went to school for. I\u2019m sitting behind a desk\
      \ inside an iconic building in Toronto where I schedule television shows for\
      \ the largest Canadian television network. I have a salary, I have a benefit\
      \ package, and I\u2019m doing well enough financially to support myself for\
      \ the next few years.\r\n\r\nGetting back to that bizarre crossroads now \u2013\
      \ I feel like I\u2019m older than I actually am. I can\u2019t go on Facebook\
      \ now without seeing people I know getting pregnant or getting engaged or also\
      \ getting career jobs. It doesn\u2019t help though that this is counter-balanced\
      \ by all the people on my Facebook that are still getting hammered every weekend\
      \ and doing nothing with their lives. Who do you want to be, Bon?\r\n\r\n\u201C\
      Whoo! Dranks with mah gurlz!\u201D\r\n\u201CCancun 2012!\u201D\r\n\r\nYou know\
      \ what I mean.\r\n\r\nGetting down to the nitty-gritty, I\u2019m making a bold\
      \ assumption that this is all stemming from the fact that I\u2019m single and\
      \ actively want to be in a relationship. No more of this going out and getting\
      \ laid business. I think I\u2019ve lost count of the amount of times I\u2019\
      ve made the joke, \u201CWe get it! You\u2019re happy!\u201D whenever a couple\
      \ walks by \u2013 unfortunately there\u2019s a half-truth buried in there somewhere.\
      \ Truth be told, I haven\u2019t had a steady girlfriend in a few years. Keyword:\
      \ Steady. I\u2019ve had a few \u201Cgirlfriends\u201D the few years that have\
      \ always been on-off-on-off but never one steady enough to actually say, \u201C\
      Yo, I\u2019m dating this girl.\u201D\r\n\r\nMy problem is that I watch too many\
      \ romantic comedies that star Ryan Gosling. Why can\u2019t I be Ryan Gosling?\
      \ Give me the rain moment \u2013 I totally earned it. I\u2019ll totally renovate\
      \ a house for you. Or I can pull that stunt from Love Actually where Andrew\
      \ Lincoln shows up at Keira Knightley\u2019s door with cue cards. You know what\
      \ I\u2019m talking about, don\u2019t even lie. Now I just have to channel my\
      \ inner Shane West in A Walk to Remember and name a star after my next girlfriend.\r\
      \n\r\nWow, did I just write that last paragraph? Moving along.\r\n\r\nThis has\

      \ I\u2019m not lying around going, \u201CWHY CAN\u2019T I FIND A GIRLFRIEND!?\u201D\
      \ It takes second-fiddle to whatever is going on in my life at the moment that\

      \ I\u2019m not old at all. My life is so fun and I honestly couldn\u2019t care\

    body: "Find Your Passion.\r\nI do so many things. Too many things, I thought.\r\
      \n\r\nI love music.\r\nI\u2019ve been a musician since I was 12.\r\nI love writing.\r\
      \nI\u2019ve had a job as both a copywriter and contributing writer for over\
      \ a year.\r\nI love photography.\r\nI take pictures on some kind of camera everyday.\r\
      \n\r\nBut if you asked me what my passion is, I wouldn\u2019t know where to\
      \ begin.\r\nI spent a long time believing that I needed to discover my \u2018\
      passion' before I could meaningfully pursue something, frustrated by the feeling\
      \ that I couldn\u2019t discover a single, \u2018true\u2019 passion.\r\n\r\n\
      That\u2019s because, unfortunately, I also love cliches like \u201Cfind your\
      \ passion.\u201D\r\nAn idea that I\u2019ve been thinking and reading a lot about\
      \ lately is pursuing your curiosities, rather than finding your passion.\r\n\
      \LI\u2019ve always found that the best way for me to find clarity and focus\
      \ is to do, rather than to think. \L\L\r\nTranslating thoughts into tangible\
      \ actions is the only way that I\u2019ve been able to give myself a clear understanding\

      Following a curiosity opens you to a world of experiences that consciously pursuing\
      \ a passion doesn\u2019t allow for. \_\r\n\r\nA favourite quote from an article\

<p>I adore illustrations. I am addicted to self help. I love that every day, I get the chance to create the life I want &#8211; a life of unlimited possibilities.</p>
<p>One day (way too long ago), I had a BIG IDEA.</p>
<p>What if I combined the things I love into an online destination that I could experience daily to lift my spirits (ahhhhhh)&#8230; Inspire me (Yes, please! I would like that)&#8230; Remind me of my blessings (my children, my husband, my friends and my well worn home)&#8230; Instill gratitude in my life.</p>
<p>I envisioned delicious illustrations &#8230;self improvement &#8230; daily interaction! Maybe this could help others too! A place with a purpose&#8230; What a BIG IDEA.</p>
<p>I adored my BIG IDEA.</p>
<p>Yet, as much as I loved it, I didn&#8217;t act on it.</p>
<p>My BIG IDEA waited for me.</p>
<p>I had a family to raise. A marriage, friends, a home and my own existing (and lovely!) growing business.</p>
<p>On vacations I would take out my BIG IDEA and play with it. Think about it. Plan. Daydream.</p>
<p>Years went by.</p>
<p>I signed up for The ListServe. &#8220;Ooooh! If I ever get picked, I will tell them all about my BIG IDEA!&#8221;</p>
<p>I had so many intentions. And my BIG IDEA just sat and continued to wait. I told my BIG IDEA, &#8220;I will get to you soon. I haven&#8217;t forgotten you. I am just too busy now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Universe replied. Via email. Tag you are it. Sitting in my inbox: [The ListServe] You&#8217;ve been selected.</p>
<p>Such an opportunity! 21,583+ subscribers!</p>
<p>My three daughters asked, &#8220;Why not tell them about your business, not the BIG IDEA&#8230; what about the business you have now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Because my BIG IDEA has been so patient. It has waited long enough.</p>
<p>My BIG IDEA should have a launch party -- a Debutant Ball. My BIG IDEA deserves some love.</p>
<p>So without further ado&#8230; Today, for the first time, 21,583+ ListServe subscribers will be introduced to my BIG IDEA. (Drumroll, please!)</p>
<p>I am proud and excited to unveil my BIG IDEA: The Good Life is Now</p>
<p>The Good Life is Now (TGLIN) is a delightful online destination &#8211;the purpose is to connect you to YOURSELF and YOUR LIFE.</p>
<p>It is taking many of the mindset activities of positive psychology, spirituality and the science of happiness &amp; well-being and delivering them in a visually delicious game type format in your own personal world.</p>
<p>TGLIN speaks to BOTH what is good in your life now, while also helping you envision an inspired future.</p>
<p>My journey to create TGLIN is just beginning.</p>
<p>I invite you to sign up online at The Good Life is Now if you would like to join me for the ride. I promise there will be lots of goodies along the way!</p>

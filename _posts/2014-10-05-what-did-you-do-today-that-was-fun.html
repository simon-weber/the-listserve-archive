      <p>That''s what my friend Tyler asked himself everyday -- he had that question
      written down on a piece of paper, which he put above his door. Tyler passed
      away in a boating accident a few years ago, but his fun-loving spirit lives
      on and inspires me to do something fun every day. I find myself asking others
      that question quite often, which prompts them to reflect on their day and either
      find fun in the little things or do something fun. I love hearing about the
      fun things other people are doing! So I''d like to pose the same question to
      you:</p>

      <p>What did you do today that was fun?  </p>

      <p>Reply to me with an answer, and I''ll tweet out the replies from my account,
      @ishwr. If you don''t want to follow me, and I don''t blame you if you don''t,

      <p>I''m looking forward to your emails! </p>

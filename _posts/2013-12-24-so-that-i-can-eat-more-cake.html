      I get really annoyed by the huge emails of life advice.</p>

      <p>For that reason I thought that if I ever got chosen, I''d send a cheese joke
      or a witty one liner. But when I got the email it suddenly didn''t seem that
      simple - it felt really weird - should I really do that when I have the opportunity

      <p>So for better of for worse, this is what I''ve decided to say:</p>

      <p>I like running. I used to hate people who said they liked running. It made
      me feel bad when I was sitting on the sofa eating cake. Now I still hate people
      who say they like running a bit, but I can eat more cake than I did before without

      <p>I run for me. I run alone and I have my own targets. I race against myself.
      I run wherever I want to, whenever I want to. </p>

      <p>If I have had a rubbish day, I can go for a run and it makes me feel better.
      I''m not sure about my direction in life, or my career, or my relationship,
      but running is something that I can be sure about.</p>

      <p>People are really important, surround yourself with them and love them back

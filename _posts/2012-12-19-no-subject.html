    \ meeting spectators and volunteers from all over the world and was proud to welcome\
    \ visitors to my country.\r\n\r\nI'll always remember and be inspired by the way\
    \ that the Olympians embraced the competition, realised life long dreams and found\
    \ years of hard work finally paying off.\r\n\r\nYou find me today as I fulfill\
    \ a life long dream of my own. I make computer games for a living and this evening\
    \ (December 12th), a product I've worked on is being released to the public for\
    \ the first time. It's been a long road to this point; I've worked through university,\
    \ broken in to the industry and suffered the heartbreak of cancelled projects.\
    \ Today, I look back on it all and feel very grateful to the family that raised\
    \ me, my partner who supports me every day and the friends and colleagues that\
    \ I've learned so much from.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading,  Have a great day :-)\r\

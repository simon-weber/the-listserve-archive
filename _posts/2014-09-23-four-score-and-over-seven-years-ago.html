      s so. But more often than not it\u2019s perseverance, indecision, uncertainty,\
      \ course correction, lots of standing still, impostor syndrome, and what feels\

      \r\nFor me too. I learned how to be good at my job by failing at it. I have\

      \ down what I didn\u2019t know and cut through it piece by piece. If someone\

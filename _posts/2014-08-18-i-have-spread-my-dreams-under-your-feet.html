      \ this, I'm sitting at beautiful Queenstown airport after giving the opening\
      \ keynote for the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons. I shared the stage\
      \ with an extraordinary young woman named Jen Morris who told her story of having\
      \ her trust violated during medical \"care\". I wish more doctors had the chance\
      \ to hear the untold stories of harm that can be caused by treatment that was\
      \ intended to heal. Next month, I'm off to London to speak with medical regulators\
      \ from around the world about high-risk health practitioners. Does it surprise\
      \ you to learn that in Australia fewer than 5% of doctors account for nearly\
      \ 50% of patient complaints?\r\n\r\nEarlier this week, I sat around the board\
      \ table of Summerset retirement villages in Wellington.  (Did you know that\
      \ the percentage of women on corporate boards is still less than 20 percent?)\
      \ At the dawn of the 20th century, children outnumbered the elderly by 8 to\
      \ 1. Soon, there will be more over 65s than children. I'm not yet sure what\

      \ future with Summerset and the University of Melbourne's new Master of Ageing.\r\
      \n\r\nI also care deeply about the health and wellbeing of young people. Next\
      \ week, I'll be with Family Planning - supporting their work towards sexual\
      \ health and reproductive rights around the world. Already, I see the difference\
      \ we are making by improving access to long acting reversible contraceptives,\
      \ supporting the rights of sex workers to a safe work environment, and enabling\
      \ teachers with a sexuality education resource called Safe Landing.\r\n\r\n\
      Between my travels, my dear friend Sarah (who walks with me at dawn), and my\
      \ beloved book club (who introduce me to treasures like Hannah Kent's \"Burial\
      \ Rites\"), keep me safe and grounded. When I travel, I'm often joined by one\
      \ of my children or my inspirational 72 year old mum, who prides herself on\

      \ of the missteps I make in everyday communication it is often because I assume\
      \ why someone said something to me, I take offense at them for the purpose behind\

      \ unless they tell me. Try and avoid making assumptions about the meaning of,\
      \ and purpose behind, someone\u2019s statement and see how it changes the flow\

      <p>First, the best piece of advice I have ever received about communication
      came from my mentor. He was fond of saying &#8220;Listening is an ethical choice
      we make.&#8221; Hearing as an auditory capacity is not the same as listening.
      Listening is an intensive activity. Listening requires vulnerability. Listening
      and willing to be vulnerable to what someone has to say allows us to communicate
      in a more open environment. We often fail to listen because we allow our predispositions
      to block communication before it ever begins.</p>

      <p>Second, be active in your communication. We often thoughtlessly react to
      what others say. This begins a negative chain of communication that can be counter-productive.
      Beyond failing to listen, we utter the first thing we think of and we fail to
      be active and mindful. If we communicate more creatively and more actively we
      can avoid reacting to others and damaging relationships with those around us.</p>

      <p>Last, don&#8217;t get hung up on assuming the intent of the person communicating
      with you. What I mean is, it is impossible to know for sure what a person intended
      to mean when they say something to us. When I think of the missteps I make in
      everyday communication it is often because I assume why someone said something
      to me, I take offense at them for the purpose behind what they said. In reality,
      I can never know the intent behind their statement unless they tell me. Try
      and avoid making assumptions about the meaning of, and purpose behind, someone&#8217;s
      statement and see how it changes the flow of your communication.</p>

<p>**Not going to tell you how to live your life!</p>
<p>I'm sick of the listserve- really. And with such strict guidelines there's little room for creativity.</p>
<p>Nothing to say to 20,000+ people. Plenty I would love to share in person (including critiques of this project!).</p>
<p>If you're in Montreal, are visiting, or will visit, email me and we'll blind (friend!) date.</p>
<p>If you live in any other area of the world I likely want to visit so also email and we can maybe connect on couchsurfing or something like that.</p>
<p>I probably sound like a grouch-I'm really not, but does it matter oh-person-from-who-knows-where-but-likely-from-the-US-of-A?</p>
<p>Peace, love, and lots of hugs,</p>

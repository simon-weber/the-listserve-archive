<p>My life changed after reading about the categorical imperative. Do a google search and you will find lots of stuff. Start with the wikipedia article.</p>
<p>One concept that I really love is about freedom.</p>
<p>"Freedom is not just the ability to do what you will (what you wish or want) but to be able to will, with nothing but pure reason"</p>
<p>We always think about freedom in terms of what we *can* do. A bigger question is, if no body stops us, what will we do? And why? Think about it.</p>
<p>BTW, New Delhi is getting hotter and hotter - it is almost 40 degrees centigrade today!</p>

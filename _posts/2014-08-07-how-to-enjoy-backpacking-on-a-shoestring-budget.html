    body: "If you interested in going backpacking but who are overwhelmed by the prospect\
      \ of accumulating the right gear, I encourage you to give the sport a try in\
      \ as simple and frugal a manner as possible.\r\n\r\nHere are some tips:\r\n\
      -Keep it simple in terms of what you want to accomplish and what you carry.\
      \ Shoot for one night out when you expect good weather, and plan to make camp\
      \ within a few miles of the trailhead.\r\n-Enjoy yourself. Backpacking can be\
      \ hard work, so take breaks. Admire nature. Appreciate the fresh air. Savor\
      \ good views and the way the sky changes color when the sun is setting.\r\n\
      -Wear comfortable shoes and clothes. A pair of sneakers from your closet will\
      \ be sufficient for most intro-level hiking trails. Wear clothes that dry quickly\
      \ and that don\u2019t chafe - think gym shorts and polyester shirt. No need\
      \ to invest in technical clothing at this point, but steer clear of cotton.\r\
      \n-If you don\u2019t need it, leave it. Especially for your first trip, lighter\
      \ is better. I learned this the hard way by carrying books, too much extra clothing,\
      \ a hatchet, complicated multi-tools, a gps unit, cumbersome chairs, unnecessary\
      \ ropes, fancy cooking equipment, etc. Granted, it\u2019s hard to know what\
      \ you\u2019ll need, but when in doubt you probably don\u2019t need the item.\r\
      \n-Cook light. There are a lot of great websites with recipes for simple backpacking\
      \ meals, search \u201Cfreezer bag cooking\u201D and you will find them. Consider\
      \ an Esbit or other solid-fuel stove and metal mug for preparing a hot meal\
      \ before spending a lot more money on a more complicated, heavier cook kit.\
      \ Less to carry, less to clean. Some backpackers leave the kitchen at home and\
      \ get their calories from protein bars. I prefer carrying a small stove to have\
      \ the pleasure of hot coffee on cold mornings. I budget 1.5 lbs. for food per\
      \ person per day. That\u2019s a lot by some standards. 2-3 lbs of nutritionally\
      \ dense dry food per person per day will be more than enough.\r\n-Camp light.\
      \ For warm weather trips, opt for the lighter tent and sleeping bag. Borrow\
      \ them, or if necessary, rent these items from your local retailer or online.\
      \ If you\u2019re feeling adventurous, plan to sleep under the stars without\
      \ a tent, perhaps bringing a tarp or heavy duty trash bags as backup in case\
      \ it rains. Learn how to rig a tarp by searching \u201Ctarp camping.\u201D Trash\
      \ bags can also serve as emergency rain protection - search \u201Ctrash bag\
      \ poncho.\u201D You\u2019ll want a light sleeping pad, perhaps a repurposed\
      \ yoga mat.\r\n-Water is important. Being dehydrated is no fun. Research water\
      \ conditions before you go, or pack in enough to get you through the trip. The\
      \ most common ways to treat raw water are boiling, chemicals, and filtering.\
      \ Water sourcing and treatment is something worth consideration before you hit\
      \ the trail.\r\n-Practice LNT. That stands for Leave No Trace. Seven guiding\
      \ principles here: Plan ahead and prepare. Travel and camp on durable surfaces.\
      \ Dispose of waste properly. Leave what you find. Minimize campfire impacts\
      \ (and make sure you check the fire regulations). Respect wildlife. And be considerate\
      \ of other visitors.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re new to backpacking please feel free\

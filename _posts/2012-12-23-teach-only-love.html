    \ of travel, I want to share about Peace and Love. When people tell me wow, you\
    \ have an amazing, well balanced, respectful son and he's still a teenager, the\
    \ only parenting advice I give is to release the need to control and send out\
    \ love. Forget the false praise or horrible punishments and focus on the issue\
    \ at hand and take each moment to educate.\r\n\r\nThe same goes with our careers,\
    \ relationships, friendships and interaction with non-human beings. Send out love,\
    \ release control and fill your core with a solid knowing that life is full of\
    \ possibilities.\r\n\r\nI've been homeless and I've had riches.. I've had cancer\
    \ a few times and I've been healthy. At the end of the day, it's always okay.\r\
    \n\r\nA shout out to my life partner Christine, for being my rock.\r\n\r\nNamaste,\

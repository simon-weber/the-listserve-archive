      I didn''t like<br />5. I hate the color orange.<br />6. Sunrise is far superior
      to sunset<br />7. Our society needs a moral revolution (re all the isms) (note:
      I am not perfect and have bias'' but we can have a goal).<br />8. Sunflowers
      are the best type of flower.<br />9. I want to ask Hillary why she voted in

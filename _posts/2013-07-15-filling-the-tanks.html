<p>Ten years ago I saw &#8220;Toy Story&#8221; and vowed to work at Pixar when I was older. Now two-and-a-half colleges and a dozen internships later, I work there. Eleven years ago I stood as a bar mitzvah in front of my peers and family members, all smiley Chesire cats, only to realize that I had no idea what religion really meant to me. Now over a decade later, I&#8217;m currently in Israel meeting four cousins I&#8217;ve never met because the only truly religious experiences I've had since my bar mitzvah have taken place at the four Beyonc&#233; concerts I've attended.</p>
<p>Twelve years ago I realized I was gay, or at least different enough to feel defeated when a classmate called me a faggot while playing basketball in gym class. Now I&#8217;ve been out to everyone in my life for almost three years and am learning that writing helps me channel my earlier negative anxieties into something positive.</p>
<p>This is all to say that I&#8217;m learning about the power of knowing your history, of being able to continually connect your present experience with the past&#8212;the now with the then. This has manifested itself in my three-week trip to Israel, during which I cried at Yad Vashem, Israel&#8217;s Holocaust memorial and museum, while walking on a recovered path from a concentration camp and sat with four Israeli soldiers who explained that conscription requires all Israeli citizens at the age of 18 (with a few exceptions) to enter the military. These soldiers&#8212;my youngest cousin included&#8212;are in their early twenties but feel to me to be a decade older. I listened quietly as they recounted stories of people like Eli Cohen, an Israeli spy who worked his way into Syria's political hierarchy in the 1960s until he became the Chief Adviser to the Minister of Defense, which my new Israeli friends believe allowed Israel to find success during the Six Day War. The pride in their voices was palpable. I thought about how while young Israelis are protecting their tiny country, us young twentysomethings are often lost in conversations that are mere regurgitations of things hastily read on our iGadgets en route to a job or internship (read: to the pursuit of an ever-growing career). This makes me wish I would&#8217;ve done one less internship and instead explored my family tree to learn more about my great grandparents who moved to America from Warsaw, Poland a long, long time ago.</p>
<p>I feel lucky to have had this time to explore my family roots. Time, that is, to &#8220;fill the tanks.&#8221; Joss Whedon, the prolific director/writer/producer, uses this phrase, and I love it. He believes in time away from routine to take in a new book, movie, or play. Or, for me, conversations with family members who live 6,000 miles away. I&#8217;ve been re-reading Peter Pan on my trip and I love the idea of Mary Darling literally tidying her children&#8217;s minds, which are confused and circular and comprised of zig zag lines. I like being open to a certain cultural messiness and taking satisfaction in being confused or surprised or both.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t close with any commands or calls to action, because I don&#8217;t know the context surrounding your respective journeys. I will, however, finish by saying that I still can&#8217;t figure out how to best close an email. Regards and Best feel slightly cold, Love is often too strong, and Cheers&#8230;well I&#8217;m just not cool enough to use Cheers.</p>
<p>I hope that this email will serve as the beginning of a larger conversation with some of you.</p>
<p><br />Beyonc&#233; for life,</p>

<p>P.S. If you&#8217;re lucky enough to have parents in your life, call them and say hello. Then call them one more time because they&#8217;ll surely want to talk to you more.</p>
<p>P.P.S. This is totally a command. Sorry I lied earlier.</p>

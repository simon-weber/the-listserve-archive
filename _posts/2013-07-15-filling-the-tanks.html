  body: "Ten years ago I saw \u201CToy Story\u201D and vowed to work at Pixar when\
    \ I was older. Now two-and-a-half colleges and a dozen internships later, I work\
    \ there. Eleven years ago I stood as a bar mitzvah in front of my peers and family\
    \ members, all smiley Chesire cats, only to realize that I had no idea what religion\
    \ really meant to me. Now over a decade later, I\u2019m currently in Israel meeting\
    \ four cousins I\u2019ve never met because the only truly religious experiences\
    \ I've had since my bar mitzvah have taken place at the four Beyonc\xE9 concerts\
    \ I've attended.\r\n\r\nTwelve years ago I realized I was gay, or at least different\
    \ enough to feel defeated when a classmate called me a faggot while playing basketball\
    \ in gym class. Now I\u2019ve been out to everyone in my life for almost three\
    \ years and am learning that writing helps me channel my earlier negative anxieties\
    \ into something positive.\r\n\r\nThis is all to say that I\u2019m learning about\
    \ the power of knowing your history, of being able to continually connect your\
    \ present experience with the past\u2014the now with the then. This has manifested\
    \ itself in my three-week trip to Israel, during which I cried at Yad Vashem,\
    \ Israel\u2019s Holocaust memorial and museum, while walking on a recovered path\
    \ from a concentration camp and sat with four Israeli soldiers who explained that\
    \ conscription requires all Israeli citizens at the age of 18 (with a few exceptions)\
    \ to enter the military. These soldiers\u2014my youngest cousin included\u2014\
    are in their early twenties but feel to me to be a decade older. I listened quietly\
    \ as they recounted stories of people like Eli Cohen, an Israeli spy who worked\
    \ his way into Syria's political hierarchy in the 1960s until he became the Chief\
    \ Adviser to the Minister of Defense, which my new Israeli friends believe allowed\
    \ Israel to find success during the Six Day War. The pride in their voices was\
    \ palpable. I thought about how while young Israelis are protecting their tiny\
    \ country, us young twentysomethings are often lost in conversations that are\
    \ mere regurgitations of things hastily read on our iGadgets en route to a job\
    \ or internship (read: to the pursuit of an ever-growing career). This makes me\
    \ wish I would\u2019ve done one less internship and instead explored my family\
    \ tree to learn more about my great grandparents who moved to America from Warsaw,\
    \ Poland a long, long time ago.\r\n\r\nI feel lucky to have had this time to explore\
    \ my family roots. Time, that is, to \u201Cfill the tanks.\u201D Joss Whedon,\
    \ the prolific director/writer/producer, uses this phrase, and I love it. He believes\
    \ in time away from routine to take in a new book, movie, or play. Or, for me,\
    \ conversations with family members who live 6,000 miles away. I\u2019ve been\
    \ re-reading Peter Pan on my trip and I love the idea of Mary Darling literally\
    \ tidying her children\u2019s minds, which are confused and circular and comprised\
    \ of zig zag lines. I like being open to a certain cultural messiness and taking\
    \ satisfaction in being confused or surprised or both.\r\n\r\nI won\u2019t close\
    \ with any commands or calls to action, because I don\u2019t know the context\
    \ surrounding your respective journeys. I will, however, finish by saying that\
    \ I still can\u2019t figure out how to best close an email. Regards and Best feel\
    \ slightly cold, Love is often too strong, and Cheers\u2026well I\u2019m just\
    \ not cool enough to use Cheers.\r\n\r\nI hope that this email will serve as the\
    \ beginning of a larger conversation with some of you.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyonc\xE9 for\

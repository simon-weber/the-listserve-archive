    body: "Dec 2011 I crossed by foot the Arava border from Israel into Jordan. The\
      \ intended trip with friends to Petra for the day wasn't well planned, so I\
      \ explored the beach town of Aqaba solo instead. I walked quite a bit, and when\
      \ it came to cross back to Eilat, Israel I was far along north on the road,\
      \ and chose to continue walking instead of taking another cab.\r\n\r\nThough\
      \ perfectly legal to cross, Jordan is considered unsafe and there are still\
      \ tensions among the people of the bordering countries. The Hebrew-marked print\
      \ of my water bottle had to come off, I figured it would be safer. I continued\
      \ walking the sandy dirt along the single road to the border crossing, now almost\
      \ in sight.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon heat was scorching. A man in uniform whistled\
      \ at me at the military outpost on the side of the road. A small shack, a tower,\
      \ and a few Humvees were all it was. I pointed in the direction of the border,\
      \ trying to indicate to the man I wished to continue ahead. I barely had time\
      \ to turn my head and take a step before he whistled again, this time shaking\
      \ a finger.\r\n\r\nI quickly thought of the contents in my backpack. An English\
      \ book from a friend, a small collection of shells, an unmarked water bottle,\
      \ a jacket, and 3 passports. Walking toward the outpost, I realized this may\
      \ not go over well. Some trouble was looming: being detained, jail, or worse.\r\
      \n\r\nI said \"hello,\" and the man pointed at a white plastic lawn chair: \"\
      sit,\" indicating to place my backpack on the side. \"Passport.\" I fumbled\
      \ through the front pocket where 3 passports sat together, weighing my options.\
      \ The choice was easy, but I couldn't have him know of the others. USA relations\
      \ to Jordan are not quite friendly. Being Israeli or Jewish may have been quickly\
      \ disastrous. I pulled the crisp red covered booklet - I was now Romanian.\r\
      \n\r\n\"Jacob?\" It wasn't quite my name but I said \"Yes, yes\" to get it going.\
      \ \"Where you going?\" I explained I was headed to Eilat to take flight home\
      \ to Romania. It wasn't quite true, but my best story out. \"You wait here.\"\
      \r\nA minute later he returned with a ceramic mug, \"Fire tea?\" We both sat\
      \ and enjoyed the spiciest hot \"Fire tea\" I've ever had. It was delicious.\
      \ \"Cigarette?\" \"Sure.\" I don't normally smoke, but I had to appease the\
      \ situation. Two men a short distance away were removing their bulletproof vests\
      \ and used them as a prayer mat to Mecca. The irony of the situation was much.\r\
      \n\r\n\"You wait here.\" Ten minutes passed, and eventually an old Toyota pickup\
      \ passed by. I was nervous to what will come next. The man whistled again and\
      \ the truck came to a screeching stop, and reversed to the station. The men\
      \ exchanged a few words in Arabic, and told me to hop in. They drove me to the\
      \ border, dropped me off, and I walked across.\r\n\r\nSimon Iacob\r\nCalifornia\r\

      \r\nUnfortunately, fighting malaria is not so simple. Bed nets seem to be\r\n\
      helping in some marginal areas, but at least in western Kenya, where\r\nthe\
      \ parasite is endemic, Kenya's long-term bed net program is not\r\nwinning the\
      \ war on malaria. The nets make sleeping more uncomfortable\r\nby hindering\
      \ air circulation, require maintenance when torn, and\r\nretreatment when the\
      \ \"long-lasting\" insecticide wears off.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago, Bill and\
      \ Melinda Gates, Ray Chambers, and others\r\nstarted a global campaign to eliminate\
      \ virtually all deaths from\r\nmalaria by 2015. Most professionals who work\
      \ in the field thought the\r\ngoal was wildly unrealistic. Unfortunately, the\
      \ pessimists were right.\r\nThe deadline is almost here and we are not even\
      \ close. Now Gates is\r\nhoping to eliminate malaria in his lifetime. I am not\
      \ abandoning the\r\nfight against malaria as a worthwhile pursuit. The problem\
      \ still\r\nfascinates me, but I no longer think it is an easy one to solve.\r\
      \n\r\nAt first it seems rational to think in terms of \"maximizing\" good. If\r\

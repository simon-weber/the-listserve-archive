      out of the way.<br />This is such an interesting platform to have. Faced with
      a (mildly interested) audience, what do I say? What do I tell you that you don&#8217;t
      already know? I don&#8217;t feel compelled to give advice or tell &#8220;my
      story.&#8221; In this moment I am faced with a desire to want to say The Right
      Things. I need to go get some lunch and think about this. One hour and fifty-six
      minutes left to write something of which I can feel at least somewhat proud.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ll share with you a quote that I really love, which is,<br />&#8220;If
      nothing changes, nothing changes.&#8221;</p>

      <p>It&#8217;s simple&#8212;perhaps too much so&#8212;but it speaks to me. The
      idea that positive things and the life that we want to live comes (at times)
      at the price of sacrificing the comfortable and familiar.</p>

      <p>I am somewhat plagued by inertia. In fact, I won The Listserve just over
      a year ago in December 2016. And I never submitted anything. I wasn&#8217;t
      sure what I wanted to say, which felt daunting, but I also just got lazy. This
      slothfulness creeps into most of the various areas of my life. (Ironically,
      I have a deep-seated fear of sloths.) I know the solution, and it&#8217;s pretty
      simple: when I take action, I feel good in the long-term; when I do nothing,
      it&#8217;s comfortable but ultimately that comfort is short-lived. How do you
      overcome this? By simply taking the initial step, I suppose. And then the inertia
      of simply keeping moving kicks in, and things get done.</p>

      <p>Over the past eight months, I&#8217;ve gone through a lot of changes&#8212;so
      I can&#8217;t really say that &#8220;nothing has changed&#8221; but that quote
      has certainly made me reflect on the ways in which I do want my life to change
      and what I want it to become. And the fact of the matter is, it&#8217;s not

      \ in 2011 (ish) as a way to sort of get rid of it, emotionally.  It is Father\u2019\
      s Day in the UK this Sunday so it\u2019s a poignant time.  Since winning I\u2019\
      ve questioned if I really do want to share it with strangers on the internet.\
      \ People can be pretty hash, what if I get loads of people telling me I shouldn\u2019\

      \ and it was right for me at the time. So here goes\u2026\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\
      \nFirstly, I want you to know that it is really painful for me to write this,\
      \ and secondly that I\u2019ve given it considerable thought.\r\nI am writing\
      \ to ask you not contact me again. Perhaps in the future I will contact you,\
      \ but for now, I think this is for the best. There are a few things you should\
      \ know that have led me to this decision.\r\nIn 2009, before I moved to Edinburgh\
      \ I was really depressed and the Doctor prescribed me with anti-depressants\
      \ and referred me to a counsellor. We talked quite a lot about things that happened\
      \ when I was growing up, mainly between you and me.  After discussing quite\
      \ a few things that have always stuck with me and upset me, the counsellor asked\
      \ me what I wanted to do about it, and we decided that I would wipe the slate\
      \ clean and move on. I was scared of getting hurt again, and so decided that\
      \ I would give you three more chances.\r\nI made a promise to myself and [my\
      \ partner] that I would stick to that. Sadly, I think you\u2019ve had the three\
      \ chances now.\r\n[I then gave examples of those three chances which I don\u2019\
      t want to share as they are\u2026 private. I appreciate the irony of that sentence.\
      \ They were along the lines of selfish behaviour, general disinterest in my\
      \ life/achievements, bigoted/racist behaviour and general rudeness. I would\
      \ disassociate with \u2018friends\u2019 who behave in that way, so why not a\
      \ parent?]\r\nThose three chances were intended to last the rest of your life,\
      \ and they\u2019re now gone in a matter of months.  These three things are just\
      \ three examples of times that I have felt sad, upset or angry because of something\
      \ that has happened. This letter isn\u2019t just about those three things; it\
      \ is the sum of everything that has happened over the years.\r\nI don\u2019\
      t profess to be an angel, but I think you should know I have always been loyal\
      \ to you; I have always given you another chance. For as far back as I can remember,\
      \ I get upset after almost every conversation we have, and yet I have always\
      \ tried to have a relationship with you as I genuinely do want a Dad. Also,\
      \ having the counselling made me realise that you had an unusual childhood,\
      \ and perhaps you are now a product of that youth. That\u2019s what made me\
      \ decide to wipe the slate clean and try again, but I think that only worked\
      \ once, and there\u2019s only so many chances you can give someone, regardless\
      \ of what kind of past they have.  I\u2019m really sad to say that I\u2019m\
      \ not capable of repeatedly feeling upset/pissed-off/sad/angry with you for\
      \ the things you do, or more importantly, don\u2019t do. And, I need to think\
      \ about myself, I need to be my priority.\r\nYou seem to be really happy with\
      \ [your partner], and seem to have a good relationship with [her daughter],\
      \ although for years you told me you didn\u2019t. I hope the same can be said\
      \ for [her other daughter, husband and grandchild].  I genuinely hope that continues,\
      \ and you maybe even one day get married. That would be lovely.\r\nIt pains\
      \ me to send this, but I know I have to. I\u2019m sorry.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\
      \n5 (ish) years later, I have spoken to him a handful of times. Sadly there\
      \ have been a few family funerals and so I\u2019ve had to contact him to let\
      \ him know. We\u2019ve discussed meeting to talk things through, and I\u2019\
      ve said yes and left the ball in his court, but then never heard from him again.\r\

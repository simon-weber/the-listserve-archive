      \ Bridge. I know what you\u2019re thinking; that\u2019s for old ladies, right?\
      \ Well, not just. Old ladies practice it as a pleasant activity, while younger\
      \ players like me see it as a sport. I\u2019ve been a member of my local bridge\
      \ club since 2008. Me and my then bridge partner were the only youth members\
      \ of the club back then. Luckily, the number of youth players has risen (actually\
      \ in the whole country) since then so we\u2019re not alone anymore. I practice\
      \ bridge as a serious sport, and last November we miraculously became Dutch\
      \ National Youth Team champions. But it has brought me many more things, including\
      \ a bit of social contact. The other youth players are all nice guys although\
      \ I am not sure whether I can consider them my friends, almost never seeing\
      \ them outside of the playing rooms.\r\n\r\n-       Need a new hobby or sport,\
      \ and do you like games in general? Try bridge. You won\u2019t regret it. I\
      \ can advise you.\r\n\r\n-       If I think I have a friend, I am never certain\

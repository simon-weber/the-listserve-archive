      So I should know a thing or two about human behaviour Apart from that (or maybe
      intertwined) I have had quite an eventful life &gt; it often feels like I''ve
      had two or three and when I have your collective attention for a moment I would
      like to share something with you that could possibly improve your life After
      trying to discern what seperates the happy people from the unhappy people I
      come up with one piece of advice:</p>

      <p>Fail.. </p>

      <p>Fail big and fail harder Unafraid and Unashamed Do a thing you want to do
      and fail at it</p>

      <p>Once you have failed, notice how things basically stay the same.. Your friends
      will still be your friends, the sky will still be blue, mornings will still
      mean getting out of bed</p>

      <p>After your failure only ask yourself only two things: &gt; What can I learn
      from this failure? &gt; Would I like to try again? Any answers you honestly
      come up  with are good answers, follow them and if applicable; fail again</p>

      <p>If by any chance you should fail to fail and succeed at the thing you want
      to do Thats ok too :-)</p>

      <p>A great big hug to all of you,</p>

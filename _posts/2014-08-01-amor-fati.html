      <p>I joined The Listserve exactly one week ago.  And I''m not really ready for
      my turn.  This feels like a speech for an Academy Award with the music already

      <p>But here is part of my life&#8230;</p>

      <p>I almost jumped from a bridge in April of 2010.  It probably wouldn''t have
      killed me &#8211; but I wanted to die.  Instead of dying, I moved to Hawai''i

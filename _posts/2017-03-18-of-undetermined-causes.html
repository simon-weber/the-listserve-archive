    body: "\u201CCan you please be more quiet? Your mom is sick,\u201D my grandmother\
      \ tells my younger brother and me while we are playing on the carpet of the\
      \ living room.\r\n\r\nI am 9 years old and to me being sick means having a cold.\
      \ But my mom is spending long hours laying in a comfortable chair in her room.\
      \ She goes to the hospital for several weeks in a row and sometimes more. My\
      \ dad goes with her while my grandmother is taking care of my little brother,\
      \ my older sister and me. Something serious is happening. I am trying to listen\
      \ to adult conversations to pick up some clues, but they carefully avoid certain\
      \ topics in my presence. The other day, my mom gave me one of her own jewel:\
      \ a black and golden butterfly. Nobody is talking about it, but I just know\
      \ it: my mom is going to die.\r\n\r\nI wake up one morning, a few days before\
      \ Christmas, as I had not seen my mom for several weeks. My grandmother does\
      \ not reply to me when I say hi to her. She is sitting on her bed with her head\
      \ down. This is strange; she would always greet me back. My dad is back at home\
      \ today, preparing breakfast.\r\n\r\n\u201CYour mom is in heaven,\u201D he tells\
      \ my brother and me. The sound of this information is so casual that everybody\
      \ keeps behaving apparently normally around the table, although we are not very\
      \ talkative. I am wondering if my little brother has understood what it means\
      \ and I later join him in his room to explain him. My sister keeps herself locked\
      \ in her room the whole day. I then go to mine to hide under the desk and cry.\r\
      \n\r\nI did not go to the funeral. Instead, I was sent to one of my friend\u2019\
      s family. I guess the adults thought it would be easier that way. Truth is,\
      \ it has been 30 years now and the pain is still as sharp as if it had been\
      \ yesterday. Why did my mom disappear? Why did she leave without saying bye?\r\
      \n\r\nI did not know it was cancer, a pretty nasty colorectal cancer that had\
      \ taken away my 43-year-old mom in a little more than a year. This is probably\
      \ why I went to study molecular biology years later. My first internship was\
      \ on a very interesting topic: the research team at the Curie Institute in Paris\
      \ was trying to determine if cancers caused by radiations harbor specific genetic\
      \ mutations. This could allow the attribution of certain cancers to determined\
      \ causes. However, holding those plastic tubes containing tumor samples from\
      \ patients in my hand felt a bit too heavy somehow. I decided to go for basic\
      \ research and to study molecular stress responses and chaperone proteins in\
      \ a microscopic worm: C. elegans. This has been fascinating. Chaperone proteins\
      \ are safeguard proteins induced upon any stress that can potentially harm the\
      \ shape of our proteins (heat, heavy metals, oxidative stress\u2026) and cause\
      \ protein aggregation and cell death. Chaperone proteins are crucial to maintain\
      \ protein homeostasis and therefore are conserved in every living organism.\
      \ They are involved in ageing and many diseases: Alzheimer, Parkinson, and\u2026\
      cancer, where they are hijacked by tumor cells at their own benefit. This is\
      \ the way I have found to study the monster from not too close.\r\n\r\nLast\
      \ week I was reading an article entitled \u201Cthe fake war against cancer\u201D\
      . Among the points of the author:  cancer is over-diagnosed nowadays, prevention\
      \ costs a fortune, large amounts of public money are invested into cancer research\
      \ and seem wasted, as there is no significant progress, despite a few milestones,\
      \ and big pharmaceutical companies make tons of money over cancer patients.\
      \ The end of the article was all about how you could prevent cancer including\
      \ diet advices, avoiding stress, because \u201Cunsolved conflicts favor cancer\u201D\
      . Reading this makes me sad, cause the reason why we treat cancer better and\
      \ cure more patients is prevention. Yes, we have not found the cure against\
      \ cancer yet, because there are multiple cancers, probably as many as cancer\
      \ patients. One of many progresses of these last years is that we are able to\
      \ treat different genetic types of cancer with appropriate treatments. Another\
      \ recent breakthrough that looks so promising to me is single-cell sequencing.\
      \ Tumors are very heterogeneous, and this might allow us to identify driver\
      \ cancer cells within tumors, have a more precise diagnostic by analyzing circulating\
      \ tumor cells, and see with much better resolution the effects of treatments.\
      \ Cancer comprises a cascade of genetic mutations and it is hard to identify\
      \ the causal mutation(s).  As far as I know, there is no proven link between\
      \ psychological stress and cancer. How unfair to the patient is this statement\
      \ that maybe he or she had cancer because of an unresolved conflict? This is\
      \ only going to make them feel guilty. If this is mind breaking not to be able\
      \ to narrow down the ultimate cause(s) of the disease, we should probably not\
      \ make up some.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading this, and sorry that it was so long.\r\

<p class="meta">April 17 2013</p>

<p>20 years isn't a lot of time to live on this Earth. Given my age and relative experience I'd venture to say that any potential advice I have would be already known by the majority of readers. </p>
<p>In my spare time I do a lot of programming. I'm perpetually curious and voracious in my problem solving. I obsess. My addictive personality takes over more often than I'd like.</p>
<p>The day before Valentine's day I broke up with my boyfriend of almost 2 years. He was 40. </p>
<p>I'm fascinated by languages, both spoken and unspoken.</p>
<p>So far, this message has read like a pithy OkCupid profile. I'm interested in stories. I'm interested in hearing about experiences and opinions. I'm interested in pen-pals. </p>
<p>Share your story with me and I'd be more than happy to share more of mine with you. Intimacy is something I have difficulty with. The Listserve seems an ideal place to begin getting over that. </p>
<p>You are loved. You are not alone and you are not worthless. And, neither am I.</p>

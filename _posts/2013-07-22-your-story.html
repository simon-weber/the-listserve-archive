    <p>The Listserve accomplishes an amazing feat of connecting people through stories
    and that&#8217;s why I first signed up when I found out about it.  Every day,
    I have looked forward to read a snippet of another person''s life and to be in
    their minds, even if it was for just 600 words or less.  Because I&#8217;ve enjoyed
    this aspect so much, here&#8217;s a little bit about me.</p>

    <p>When I was 7 years old, my dad died of an infection.  It was the most devastating
    time of my life but I learned that life really does go on, even though at that
    moment it seemed like my whole world stopped.  Through endless love and support
    from my mom, I have grown into a person that I think he would have been proud
    of.  Going into my senior year of high school, I have so many things to look forward
    to.  I dream of attending Colorado College and just doing what I love to do.  I
    really have no idea what my profession will be or what my life will even be like
    a week from now, but what I do know is that I&#8217;m happy right now and in this
    moment.</p>

    <p>Each person that resides on this planet has their own story.  It could be filled
    with heartbreaks and loss or opportunities and joy.  It is occupied by whatever
    you have been through, which is utterly unique to the story of the stranger who
    is standing next to you in line or your wife who is nestled in your arms.  In
    some remarkable way, these stories are intertwined in a spiderweb spanning across

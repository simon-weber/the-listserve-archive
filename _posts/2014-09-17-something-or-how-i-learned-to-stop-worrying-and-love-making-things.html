      things. I don&#8217;t care what kinds of things you make, but make something.
      You can do it by yourself, or you can work with someone else, or you can make
      something based on someone else&#8217;s work. Here are some suggestions of things
      you can make:</p>

      <p>A bowl of pasta with homemade sauce and meatballs<br />A robot that you can
      play catch with<br />A story about a girl and her pet rat<br />A webpage that
      generates new, exciting, and sometimes nonsensical jokes about noses<br />An
      edit to wikipedia about a topic that interests you<br />A quilt for someone
      you care about like a pet<br />I enjoy every part/phase/stage of making.</p>

      <p>There&#8217;s the planning stage, where you try and come with ideas, turn
      them around in your mind and tweak them until you can bring it into the world.</p>

      <p>There&#8217;s the scavenging phase where you find and bring together all
      of the pieces/thoughts/feelings you need to make the thing inside your head(s).</p>

      <p>There&#8217;s the doing phase, where you take something like a blank page,
      an existing project, or a box of parts and transform it into something new/different/better/worse
      than it was before</p>

      <p>And then it starts over again. The thing you&#8217;ve made eventually changes
      again. Sometimes it&#8217;s entropy as it falls apart. Sometimes it&#8217;s
      you, coming back to tweak what you&#8217;ve created because you had another
      idea. Sometimes it&#8217;s teeth, because you&#8217;ve baked a delicious cake
      and there&#8217;s no point in letting a cake go to waste.</p>

      <p>You&#8217;ll be able to look forward to some part of the making process,

      <p>If you need help making things, or want to share the things you&#8217;ve
      made, or you&#8217;re looking for people who like making just as much as you
      do, you should see if there&#8217;s a hackerspace/makerspace/sewing club/quilting

<p>When I was young I was angry.</p>
<p>So much seemed to be wrong in so many parts of the world - I didn't know what to do, I just knew I wanted to do *something*.</p>
<p>Yet changing the system seemed impossible for millions to bring about, never mind one angry teenager.</p>
<p>5 years ago, a small thought changed my life.</p>
<p>I realised 'the system' - with its business, jobs and money - is not the problem. It's just a tool.</p>
<p>Most use that tool to prosper regardless of their impact on others - but you don't have to.</p>
<p>I started a business that finds ways to use the web - something I knew a lot about - to improve lives.</p>
<p>We make a profit so we can pay fair wages, and reinvest what&#8217;s left into doing more good.</p>
<p>This is a &#8220;social enterprise&#8221; - it puts people, not profit, first. I think the world would be better if every business were replaced with one.</p>
<p>I'm not noble or brave enough to give everything I have to charity - or to fly to a more needy country to lend a hand. But every day I do a job that I know makes the world a little bit better instead of a little more unfair.</p>
<p>I'll never make much money from it.</p>
<p>But I feel rich - and a whole lot less angry.</p>

      \ wrestling, such as \"how does one become a wrestler\" or \"what is the thought\

      \ line of questioning focused more on \"who becomes a wrestler\" and more importantly\
      \ \"why does a person become a wrestler?\"\r\n\r\nClearly that answer is unique\
      \ to each individual involved and as you can imagine everyone in our industry\
      \ is a bit of an odd bird. I sometimes joke that the people in wrestling range\
      \ from the unique to the mentally ill. Though involvement may sometimes be for\
      \ the wrong reasons almost all of us do it because we simply feel like we have\
      \ to. \r\n\r\nThere is a unique experience that comes from professional wrestling\
      \ that is found in no other art form that I know. There is the ballet-like expression\
      \ of human emotion through physical movement, there is improvisation interwoven\
      \ through conspired melodies like jazz. But to combine them into one form with\
      \ a beautiful, sometimes malevolent, intention of manipulating people into states\

      \ the film already I advised her to watch Darren Aranofsky's \"The Wrestler.\"\
      \ Though it does illustrate a darker side of professional wrestling, the side\
      \ of drugs and damaged relationships, it also shows the kind of personality\
      \ that thrives in that business. Due to it's numerous allusions to the Jesus\
      \ story I sometimes call the film \"The Passion of the Ram.\" Randy \"The Ram's\"\
      \ side is pierced in his match against Necro Butcher, he has a messianic pathology\
      \ that leads him to sacrifice everything for the\r\nenjoyment of his fans, and\
      \ eschewed by society and scourged in the ring. A direct comparison is even\
      \ made by the character Cassidy who quotes the Bible by way of the film \"The\
      \ Passion of the Christ\":\r\n\r\n\t\t    \"He was pierced for our\r\n     \
      \               transgressions, He was crushed for\r\n                    our\
      \ iniquities. The punishment that\r\n                    brought us peace was\
      \ upon Him, and\r\n                    by His wounds we were healed.\"\r\n\r\
      \nIt is as if the sacrificial lamb has reached full adulthood and has become\
      \ The Ram. I know that my involvement in wrestling makes me predisposed to enjoying\
      \ this film but I'd advise you to look up Penn Jillette's \"Penn Points\" in\
      \ which he reviews this movie. He is an artist with whom I have great admiration\
      \ and I think his time as a performer gives him a special understanding of the\
      \ picture.\r\n\r\nI've heard many criticisms of our \"sport\" and consider myself\
      \ an ambassador for our business. My character, my \"gimmick\" if you will,\
      \ is \"The Voice of Reason\" because it is a reflection of who I am in real\
      \ life. I do not believe in supernatural powers and am an advocate for science\
      \ and skepticism. I do not use drugs or alcohol because, as a human, I am already\
      \ driven by enough irrational thinking and I feel that as person of some minor\
      \ influence (particularly to children) that I should demonstrate that toughness\
      \ is more than just physical.\r\n\r\nShould you have questions about wrestling,\
      \ my films, or anything else feel free to contact me. I also encourage you to\
      \ follow me on Twitter: @chxck\r\n\r\nI wish you all lives filled with love,\
      \ endurance, and creativity.\r\n\r\n\r\nChuck Porterfield\t\r\nchuckporterfield@gmail.com\t\

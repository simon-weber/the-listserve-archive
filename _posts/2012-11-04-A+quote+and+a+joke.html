<p>Once a friend told me, "o godz--the building across the street just grew a proboscis."</p>
<p>It was construction season in Boston.</p>
<p>-------------</p>
<p>Two mathematicians, Joe and Bob, are in a restaurant.  Joe is talking about how he feels that math education has really improved in his lifetime.</p>
<p>Bob is a grumpy old man.  He disagrees.  Strongly.</p>
<p>Joe says, "You know, I bet the average person on the street even knows a little calculus."  Bob laughs.</p>
<p>Bob goes to the bathroom.  While he's gone, Joe calls their waitress over and tells her: "Listen, I'm going to ask you to come over here in about five minutes.  When you do, I'll ask you a question.  I want you to answer "One-third x cubed." If you do, I'll leave an extra $5 in the tip."</p>
<p>The waitress blinks at him.  "One thir-dex cue?"</p>
<p>"Sure, close enough."</p>
<p>Bob comes back from the bathroom and Joe says, "Look, I'll bet our waitress knows the integral of x squared."</p>
<p>Bob scoffs.  Joe bets him $10.</p>
<p>They call the waitress over and Joe asks her the integral of x squared.  As instructed, she answers "One third x cubed".</p>
<p>And as she's walking away, she calls back over her shoulder, "plus a constant."</p>

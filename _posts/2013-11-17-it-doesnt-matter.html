      Getting to the gate, there was a slow shuffle to the desk to board, and we came\

      \r\n\r\n\r\nAll he meant was, it didn't matter whether the man went first, or\
      \ we did. We were all just about to get on the same plane and sit down for a\
      \ good number of hours, so really, it didn't matter who went first.\r\n\r\n\

      \ with dying. I've experienced enough of it to not be scared of it. Well that's\
      \ not true, I'm scared of pain, loss, suffering... But when I think about what\

      \ a conclusion a while back - this is the nub of my email by the way -  that\
      \ instead of thinking of our lives as states where we are alive (now) and one\

      \r\nConsider for a moment, that you will always be alive.\r\n\r\nIn the way\
      \ that you are alive right now. In this moment.\r\n\r\nWhen we see time as something\
      \ more than past/present/future, and see it as always 'now', just consider that\
      \ you will always be alive.\r\n\r\nNow consider as well as always being alive,\
      \ like you are right now...you will always be dead.\r\n\r\nYou're dead right\
      \ now. You - in the present now - will one day be in the present, dead.\r\n\r\
      \nWhen is the present? Always.\r\n\r\nSee it?\r\n\r\nMaybe. Maybe not. Try it\
      \ on for size again.\r\n\r\nThe state of living and dying exists in the same\
      \ time: now.\r\n\r\nWhen life and death don't matter, you can just get on with\
      \ being in the moment. Forever.\r\n\r\nIf you've ever stood at a big jumping\

      \ going to jump. You know how high you are. It gives you butterfly's in the\
      \ stomach. You are in the moment. Exactly in the moment, alive. Whoa! What a\
      \ rush.\r\n\r\nBut that moment - just when you imagine doing it...jumping off...but\
      \ know you haven't actually moved?\r\n\r\nMoving from being right there in the\
      \ moment, to thinking about what is about to happen next, out of that present-feeling?\r\
      \n\r\nThat's what we think about dying.\r\n\r\nDying is another experience,\
      \ it doesn't fit into something we know.\r\n\r\nWe know we won't hit the water,\
      \ or feel hitting the water. It's hard to grasp...trying to feel something that\
      \ is EXACTLY about NOT being able to feel something.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon't think\

      \ house, the one whose\r\nPorch light burned yellow\r\nNight and day, in any\
      \ weather.\r\nA dog barked at me, until\r\nShe came out pulling\r\nAt her gloves,\
      \ face bright\r\nWith rouge. I smiled,\r\nTouched her shoulder, and led\r\n\
      Her down the street, across\r\nA used car lot and a line\r\nOf newly planted\
      \ trees,\r\nUntil we were breathing\r\nBefore a drugstore. We\r\nEntered, the\
      \ tiny bell\r\nBringing a saleslady\r\nDown a narrow aisle of goods.\r\nI turned\
      \ to the candies\r\nTiered like bleachers,\r\nAnd asked what she wanted -\r\n\
      Light in her eyes, a smile\r\nStarting at the corners\r\nOf her mouth. I fingered\r\
      \nA nickle in my pocket,\r\nAnd when she lifted a chocolate\r\nThat cost a dime,\r\
      \nI didn\u2019t say anything.\r\nI took the nickle from\r\nMy pocket, then an\
      \ orange,\r\nAnd set them quietly on\r\nThe counter. When I looked up,\r\nThe\
      \ lady\u2019s eyes met mine,\r\nAnd held them, knowing\r\nVery well what it\
      \ was all\r\nAbout.\r\n\r\nOutside,\r\nA few cars hissing past,\r\nFog hanging\
      \ like old\r\nCoats between the trees.\r\nI took my girl\u2019s hand\r\nIn mine\
      \ for two blocks,\r\nThen released it to let\r\nHer unwrap the chocolate.\r\n\
      I peeled my orange\r\nThat was so bright against\r\nThe gray of December\r\n\
      That, from some distance,\r\nSomeone might have thought\r\nI was making a fire\

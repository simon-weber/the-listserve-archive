<p>That idea you have? Stop putting it off. Will it be difficult? Probably. Will you want to give up? Absolutely. But don&#8217;t. You have to persevere.</p>
<p>What about failure? Learn from it. Try again. Be smarter this time. Make new mistakes. There&#8217;s a story I heard once: it took Edison more than 1,000 tries to invent the light bulb. He remarked to a reporter that he had not failed, he had simply found 1,000 ways to not create a light bulb.</p>
<p>How about luck? You&#8217;ll need it. But don&#8217;t let that stop you. You can&#8217;t get lucky if you don&#8217;t even try.</p>
<p>Get started. Change something. Do something.</p>

      --\r\n\r\nSaturday, July 4\r\n\r\nThe first fireworks exploded over the Mississippi\
      \ as I ran through the alley behind my own house. I didn\u2019t know the exact\
      \ intentions of the man chasing me, but the gun and the yelling and the broken\
      \ window he\u2019d left at Elise\u2019s place led me to believe that he wasn\u2019\
      t trying to return misdelivered mail.\r\n\r\nAs another fiery bloom took shape\
      \ over the water, I paused for a split second to check on his progress. Just\
      \ before the BOOM, I caught a glimpse of him silhouetted in red, exuding anger\
      \ even though I couldn\u2019t see his face. As the light faded, he turned toward\
      \ my back porch, and I swore to myself; I\u2019d been hoping to steal into my\
      \ house and figure out what the hell to do next, but if he was heading that\
      \ way, my plans were going to have to change.\r\n\r\nAnd then I saw him passing\
      \ my house with a single disinterested look, his eyes focused on the corners\
      \ and the exits.\r\n\r\nShit.\r\n\r\nHe\u2019d seen me. My plans were going\
      \ to have to change fast.\r\n\r\nFortunately, my small scraggly side yard butted\
      \ up against an auto repair shop, and I knew where there was a flap in the fence.\
      \ The head mechanic had cut it out last summer so his wife\u2019s unlovable\
      \ pair of yap-dogs could sneak out and shit on my property instead, and I figured\
      \ I was well within my rights to use it myself. I made my way to the appropriate\
      \ section of fence, hoping against hope that the grand finale wasn\u2019t in\
      \ the offing; I crouched, pushed the corner, and wriggled onto their asphalt,\
      \ leaving nothing but a big heaping pile of my dignity behind, and opening onto\
      \ a lot of lousy options.\r\n\r\nThe expanse of parking lot between me and the\
      \ garage was exposed, well-lit against thieves and undoubtedly covered by some\
      \ kind of alarm; I was about as likely to be able cross Lake Ponchartrain in\
      \ my t-shirt and jeans. I could have potentially made a sprint for the little\
      \ front office, but it was about the size of a phone booth, and I didn\u2019\
      t relish standing in a shooting gallery.\r\n\r\nI figured my best chance at\
      \ hiding was the line of cars just to my left. There were four or five in various\
      \ states of disrepair and they weren\u2019t all that opaque, but I could get\
      \ behind them in a couple strides and reassess what had gone wrong with my life.\r\
      \n\r\nAnd so I took a deep breath, mentally measured the distance to the beat-to-hell\
      \ green Camry closest to me, closed my eyes and tried to steel the shaking in\
      \ my knees long enough to walk over without my teeth chattering and giving me\
      \ away.\r\n\r\nIt took four steps. Each one of them seemed to last a damn eternity,\
      \ but the only explosions that punctuated the sultry New Orleans night were\
      \ those from the fireworks display. As I settled in behind the Camry\u2019s\
      \ wheel well, nothing shot yet but my nerves, I had to laugh to myself.\r\n\r\
      \nI\u2019d had a lot of lousy rebound relationships. But this was the first\
      \ one that was about to get me killed.\r\n\r\n\r\nMatt Konrad\t\r\nmjkonrad@gmail.com\t\

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm from somewhere far away.<br />Apparently, I live in the most remote city with a population in excess<br />of one million people.</p>
<p>Hello from Auckland, New Zealand.</p>
<p>I don't feel very far away from you. I think we probably have a few<br />things in common.<br />I live and breathe and work and sleep and eat and love.<br />I read this list email every day and I hope for a glimmer of<br />inspiration from others.<br />I struggle with depression and anxiety and stress and worry. Some days<br />I feel like every day is a battle.<br />Some days, it is a battle for me just to get out of bed.</p>
<p>But today feels like a good day. I told myself this morning when I<br />woke up that it would be a good day.<br />And here we are. It's a good day. The sun still shines. I chose for<br />today to be a good day.</p>
<p>You choose your path. You're the one who decides what can happen to<br />you and if you'll let it happen to you.<br />I feel like I need to remind myself of this more often.</p>
<p>I'll finish with a quote I liked from Ralph W. Emerson</p>
<p>What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared<br />to what lies within us.</p>

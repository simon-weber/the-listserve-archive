      <p>I don''t feel very far away from you. I think we probably have a few<br />things
      in common.<br />I live and breathe and work and sleep and eat and love.<br />I
      read this list email every day and I hope for a glimmer of<br />inspiration
      from others.<br />I struggle with depression and anxiety and stress and worry.
      Some days<br />I feel like every day is a battle.<br />Some days, it is a battle
      for me just to get out of bed.</p>

      <p>But today feels like a good day. I told myself this morning when I<br />woke
      up that it would be a good day.<br />And here we are. It''s a good day. The
      sun still shines. I chose for<br />today to be a good day.</p>

      <p>You choose your path. You''re the one who decides what can happen to<br />you
      and if you''ll let it happen to you.<br />I feel like I need to remind myself
      of this more often.</p>

      <p>I''ll finish with a quote I liked from Ralph W. Emerson</p>

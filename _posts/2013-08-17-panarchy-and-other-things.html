    \ unpredictable reasons. But nature deals with change much more gracefully than\
    \ humans do and we can learn a lot from natural systems. The book applies to every\
    \ aspect of human life from relationships, to running a company, to planning a\
    \ city, the list goes on. What I\u2019ve taken from the book (these are my words,\
    \ not the authors\u2019) is that we have to expect that things won\u2019t always\
    \ be going well, stable or growing. We have to expect periods of decline and disorder\
    \ (think of things moving along a figure 8). If we expect it we might become better\

    <p>1)      Read Panarchy by Lance Gunderson and C.S. Holling. I have to admit
    I haven&#8217;t read the entire book, but the premise itself is worth sharing.  To
    me the book is about our innate fear/inability to deal with change. The idea is
    that in nature, as well as in our day-to-day life, things are in a constant state
    of flux - growth and decline. This happens for a lot of predictable and unpredictable
    reasons. But nature deals with change much more gracefully than humans do and
    we can learn a lot from natural systems. The book applies to every aspect of human
    life from relationships, to running a company, to planning a city, the list goes
    on. What I&#8217;ve taken from the book (these are my words, not the authors&#8217;)
    is that we have to expect that things won&#8217;t always be going well, stable
    or growing. We have to expect periods of decline and disorder (think of things
    moving along a figure 8). If we expect it we might become better at dealing with
    it. The book is out of print but available on Amazon. I guess the book stuck with
    me because it changed my perspective on a lot of things.</p>

    <p>2)      Food advice: Google &#8220;Glory Bowl.&#8221; I recommend making it
    with grated zucchini and broccoli and replacing the tofu and rice with black beans
    and quinoa. You can thank me later :-)</p>

    <p>3)      On quarter-life crises: I&#8217;ve struggled a lot with the desire
    to travel and live in new places versus settling down in one place and starting
    my career. Though I don&#8217;t think there is a right answer, many good friends
    have reminded me that as wonderful as it is to move and travel and to keep a bucket
    list, at the end of the day it is important to &#8220;create yourself&#8221; and
    to focus on the relationships that matter. People are more important than places.
    I&#8217;m at a point where I&#8217;m feeling really lucky to have crossed paths
    with so many inspiring and courageous people and to be doing something I enjoy
    near the people that matter to me most.</p>

    <p>Now I&#8217;m going to try to do something creative, bear with me.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;m currently studying urban planning in Toronto, Canada. With that said
    I would really love for you to e-mail me a photo of one of your favourite places
    in the city/town you live in and a sentence or two about what you love most about
    where you live. My goal is to eventually collate everything and create something

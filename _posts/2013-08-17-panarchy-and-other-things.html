<p>I can&#8217;t take credit for most of what I&#8217;m about to share with you. I&#8217;m just passing along borrowed "words of wisdom" that I've received and keep coming back to. Hopefully they will mean something to some of you too.</p>
<p>1)      Read Panarchy by Lance Gunderson and C.S. Holling. I have to admit I haven&#8217;t read the entire book, but the premise itself is worth sharing.  To me the book is about our innate fear/inability to deal with change. The idea is that in nature, as well as in our day-to-day life, things are in a constant state of flux - growth and decline. This happens for a lot of predictable and unpredictable reasons. But nature deals with change much more gracefully than humans do and we can learn a lot from natural systems. The book applies to every aspect of human life from relationships, to running a company, to planning a city, the list goes on. What I&#8217;ve taken from the book (these are my words, not the authors&#8217;) is that we have to expect that things won&#8217;t always be going well, stable or growing. We have to expect periods of decline and disorder (think of things moving along a figure 8). If we expect it we might become better at dealing with it. The book is out of print but available on Amazon. I guess the book stuck with me because it changed my perspective on a lot of things.</p>
<p>2)      Food advice: Google &#8220;Glory Bowl.&#8221; I recommend making it with grated zucchini and broccoli and replacing the tofu and rice with black beans and quinoa. You can thank me later :-)</p>
<p>3)      On quarter-life crises: I&#8217;ve struggled a lot with the desire to travel and live in new places versus settling down in one place and starting my career. Though I don&#8217;t think there is a right answer, many good friends have reminded me that as wonderful as it is to move and travel and to keep a bucket list, at the end of the day it is important to &#8220;create yourself&#8221; and to focus on the relationships that matter. People are more important than places. I&#8217;m at a point where I&#8217;m feeling really lucky to have crossed paths with so many inspiring and courageous people and to be doing something I enjoy near the people that matter to me most.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m going to try to do something creative, bear with me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m currently studying urban planning in Toronto, Canada. With that said I would really love for you to e-mail me a photo of one of your favourite places in the city/town you live in and a sentence or two about what you love most about where you live. My goal is to eventually collate everything and create something to share with you.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to laugh and indulge in a little chocolate and/or wine every day.</p>
<p>Much love,</p>

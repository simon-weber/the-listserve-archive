    body: "Growing along a garden gate was a beautiful bush of yellow roses. Every\
      \ day was sunny and beautiful, and the rose bush blossomed.\r\n\r\nAs the days\
      \ passed, she grew big and beautiful delighting in the joy she brought to the\
      \ people who walked by her gate. The perfume from her yellow buds swept through\
      \ the neighborhood on the afternoon breeze coaxing smiles from even those of\
      \ a melancholy nature. Her spirit was optimistic and saw the positive even in\
      \ a rainy day.\r\n\r\nAfter a time the rose bush became too overgrown. Her limbs\
      \ heavy with her beautiful buds and their delightful fragrance. But also those\
      \ shrewd thorns that snag unwary fingers.\r\n\r\nSo as the afternoon began to\
      \ wane, the Gardener brought out His pruning shears and began to cut away some\
      \ of the growth.\r\n\r\nThe rose bush wept for her lost limbs, the beautiful\
      \ buds and even those shrewd thorns. For they had been part of her.\r\n\r\n\
      As He worked the Gardener whispered in her ear, \"Shhh, my beautiful rose bush.\
      \ Be brave. For though the pain is sharp right now, one day this pain will make\
      \ you stronger and more beautiful than ever.\"\r\n\r\nThe moon began to climb\
      \ across the sky when He finished and left her in the night air with the pieces\
      \ of her scattered at her feet and her heart broken. While the crickets chirped\
      \ their part of the night symphony, she mourned what she had just lost, feeling\
      \ every missing leaf and thorn so keenly that it was hard to breathe.\r\n\r\n\
      When the symphony finished and dawn began to break along the horizon, the rose\
      \ bush thought about what the Gardener had said and what He had promised. With\
      \ the first rays of the morning sun warming what was left of her, she began\
      \ to hope.\r\n\r\n<><><>\r\n\r\nI wrote the above story when my husband and\
      \ I were struggling to get pregnant with our first child three years ago. It\
      \ was my way of expressing the pain and frustration I felt without explicitly\
      \ saying what was happening. Infertility is a sensitive subject. At the time\
      \ I didn\u2019t want to share with anyone outside my husband and immediate family\
      \ what we were going through. Partly because I didn\u2019t want to broadcast\
      \ that we were trying to get pregnant. Despite how easy it is to share everything\
      \ in our lives these days, not everything is meant to be shared with everyone.\r\
      \n\r\nWriting has always been my catharsis. Whenever I\u2019m experiencing a\
      \ particularly difficult time, I find I work through my emotions best when I\
      \ write about them. It can come in the form of poetry, short story, or letter.\
      \ Sometimes, I learn about feelings I didn\u2019t realize I had. It doesn\u2019\
      t always happen right away, but eventually I will feel better and have more\
      \ clarity on my situation.\r\n\r\nShortly after I published the above story\
      \ on my blog, we were told our chances of conceiving on our own were 25% at\
      \ best. (Compared to the 85% chance couples without infertility problems have.)\
      \ We started to make plans with a fertility specialist. And then we found out\
      \ I was pregnant. Our daughter is now almost two, and I\u2019m pregnant with\
      \ our second child (due in July). Life is good.\r\n\r\nIf you want to connect,\

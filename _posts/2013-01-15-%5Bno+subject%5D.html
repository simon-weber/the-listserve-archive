<p>We don&#8217;t have time to think. Yet you are searching for answers here. Good for you. Many of you have no time to read this. But this edition is on sale. It&#8217;s limited and you may get a prize.</p>
<p>Check your spam inbox if you have Gmail. I found out I won the Listserve lottery there.</p>
<p>Did you know that spam is used to send secret messages in some factions?</p>
<p>An anagram for Listserve is: Evil Rests. Each time we open these messages, it seems 'tis is true. Angry internet sleeps.</p>
<p>Relax and breathe when you read these emails. QUIT SKIMMING! Or unsubscribe!</p>
<p>Connect. 1,2,3,4. Let&#8217;s stop staring at these screens all the time. They are everywhere! Look at the cosmos. And how about neglected family members? It is frustrating watching people whom actively seek and learn more about celebrities rather than keeping in touch and finding out about their own families and friends. Then I realized I know Robin Lehner&#8217;s save percentage in Binghamton. ;)</p>
<p>23 and me. Why not try that service in lieu of my youthful ignorance to ancestry?</p>
<p>News, weather, sports, entertainment: Escapism.</p>
<p>Drugs, alcohol, sex, rock and roll: Why do we all seek escape? Good answer there if you find it.</p>
<p>On that note, John Titor wrote a great story. HST said Revelations was amongst the best work of fiction he read. Frederick Exley: A Fan&#8217;s Notes: recommended read. Seahawks win the Super Bowl in 2013.</p>
<p>SHOUTOUT TO THE 2 Listservers in Bosnia and 3 in Ghana! *as of writing.</p>
<p>Mental illness and depression should not be taboo. We all know people who suffer. If you have it, talk. If they have it, listen. Some confuse the lost ones as being cowards. THEY are the selfish ones.  The lost ones don&#8217;t want to burden &#8220;them&#8221;.</p>
<p>David Lynch: Garmonbozia, buddy. TM movement. Yes, 20 times more veterans died this year from suicide than active duty personnel died in combat.</p>
<p>Words and phrases are used against us daily. They cause more mass destruction than missiles.</p>
<p>An insurgent may be a hero in another land. The winners of war will always write the history books. Afghanistan and Vietnam: Drugs.</p>
<p>Yes, an ounce of weed will put you in jail longer than anyone involved in LIBOR or the Gulf Oil spill. Free Marc Emery like the WM3. Damien Echols! Natalie Maines, baba booey.</p>
<p>Politicians. All speak the same language. Think for yourself.</p>

<p>Frank Zappa was more than just a genius musician. Watch his old interviews on YouTube. I want to drink tea someday with Diva and knit with her. Atoms For Peace in February. I miss Chieftan Mews.</p>
<p>Try to convince yourself that you have been brainwashed since Day 1 and live open-minded for a week. No bells, no alarms, no rules, no money.</p>
<p>Beat to your own drum. Hey Ringo! Drones are flying overhead. LA LA LA LA LA  la la la la la!!</p>
<p>Fuck censorship.</p>

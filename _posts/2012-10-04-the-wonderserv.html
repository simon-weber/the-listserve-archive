  body: "Alright, here's what we're going to do: I want all of you to tell me about\
    \ the things that make you feel awe. By awe, I mean a sense of wonder at the mystery\
    \ of existence or the size of the universe--a sort of overpowering ecstasy mingled\
    \ with just a little bit of melancholy or existential dread. So for example, maybe\
    \ awe is what you feel when you look up at the stars, or into your child's eyes.\
    \ If you're religious, maybe you experience awe when you feel the presence of\
    \ God. Whatever awe means to you, and whatever shape it takes, I want to hear\
    \ about it.\r\n\r\nYour answer can take the form of a straightforward explanation,\
    \ a story, a poem, a drawing, a video, a photograph, a song, or whatever else\
    \ you want. It doesn't even have to be your creation; if a Beatles song makes\
    \ you feel awe, then send me a YouTube link to that Beatles song. If someone said\
    \ or wrote something which inspires awe, then quote them. Your answer can be anonymous\
    \ or not, but I do at least want to know where you're from.\r\n\r\nSend your answers\
    \ to the email below, or go to Tumblr and search for the tag \"wonderserv\" for\
    \ further instructions.\r\n\r\nI'll take the best answers--which is to say, the\
    \ answers that make me feel at least an echo of your awe--and post them on the\
    \ tumblog you find using that tag. Can't wait to hear your responses.\r\n\r\n\r\

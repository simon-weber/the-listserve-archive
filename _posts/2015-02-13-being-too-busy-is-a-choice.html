      \ Or go to bed an hour later. Anyways, stop crying about it. There is always\
      \ time.\r\n\r\n\xD8  You are never too busy, you just choose to be busy. It\
      \ really isn\u2019t about the time you have, it\u2019s about prioritizing. You\
      \ have got just as many hours in one day as Einstein, Steve Jobs or Nelson Mandela\
      \ had to achieve what you want to achieve. Get it?\r\n\r\n\xD8  Saying you are\
      \ \u2018too busy\u2019 or \u2018stressed-out\u2019 is not really a great conversation-starter.\
      \ Really, everybody is stressed out these days. It really is a negative way\
      \ to start a conversation, the only thing you are saying with something like\
      \ that is that you are super important and very necessary. We all think that\
      \ of ourselves, you don\u2019t have to put it out there again.\r\n\r\nSo please,\
      \ let\u2019s start a little movement here together. How stuffed your agenda\
      \ may be, how many projects you are on at the same moment and how many sport\
      \ clubs you have to attend during one week, don\u2019t say you are \u2018too\
      \ busy\u2019. Just come up with something more interesting.\r\n\r\nIf someone\
      \ asks you if you have got time to meet, don\u2019t respond with \u2018I am\
      \ too busy\u2019, but respond with \u2018that\u2019s not my first priority\u2019\
      . Let\u2019s see how that feels.\r\n\r\nWhen I stopped yelling around that I\
      \ was too busy, it really helped me feeling less stressed out and besides that\
      \ it automatically helped me prioritize. Just give it a try!\r\n\r\nI would\
      \ love to hear your thoughts on this subject. Is there also a \u2018too busy\u2019\
      -culture in your country or the scene where you work in? And how do you feel\

      <p>In the creative industries - from which the scene I work in is a part of
      - I hear people tell me and others that they are ''too busy'' to meet, go out

      later. Anyways, stop crying about it. There is always time.</p>

      <p>&#216;  You are never too busy, you just choose to be busy. It really isn&#8217;t
      about the time you have, it&#8217;s about prioritizing. You have got just as

      what you want to achieve. Get it?</p>

      <p>&#216;  Saying you are &#8216;too busy&#8217; or &#8216;stressed-out&#8217;
      is not really a great conversation-starter. Really, everybody is stressed out
      these days. It really is a negative way to start a conversation, the only thing
      you are saying with something like that is that you are super important and
      very necessary. We all think that of ourselves, you don&#8217;t have to put
      it out there again.</p>

      <p>So please, let&#8217;s start a little movement here together. How stuffed
      your agenda may be, how many projects you are on at the same moment and how
      many sport clubs you have to attend during one week, don&#8217;t say you are
      &#8216;too busy&#8217;. Just come up with something more interesting.</p>

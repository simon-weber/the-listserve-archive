      \ to write so soon! I've always thought of what I would write if I ever had\
      \ the opportunity but of course now my mind is blank.\r\n\r\nSo I've decide\
      \ to write about three things that are important in my life at the moment.\r\
      \n\r\n1. Music: Music has always been a huge part of my life. I've never been\
      \ the type of person to say what I'm feeling or what is on my mind but I feel\
      \ I can express my feelings through music.\r\nHere is some good music I've been\
      \ into lately and favorites that I've always loved:\r\nOctaHate by Ryn Weaver\r\
      \nOblivion by Bastille\r\nThe Mother We Share by CHVRCHES\r\nEd Sheeran\r\n\
      Mayday Parade\r\nThe City and Girls by The 1975\r\n\r\n2.Samantha: I see the\
      \ love of my life this week after being apart from her for almost two months.\
      \ Many people roll their eyes or look at me in disbelief when I tell them that\
      \ I've found \"the one\" at 22 years old. I can honestly say that I have. When\
      \ I was 18 I had a relationship with someone that I was so sure of being the\
      \ one. I was certain that they were possibly the person I could spend the rest\
      \ of my life with. As time went on things started to change and so did the both\
      \ of us. She started planning important things in her life and I was just waiting\
      \ to start mine. Eventually, our relationship ended and I realized so much at\
      \ this point in my life. I realized that I needed to learn to love myself first\
      \ and find happiness within myself and not others. Looking back on that time\
      \ I realized how much I was in love with the idea of us more than the person\
      \ I was with. Now, in my current relationship I know how it feels to find your\
      \ better half and be in love with them through every obstacle. She makes me\
      \ want to be a better person and strive to do well in life. I'd be lost without\
      \ her and I can't wait to see her.\r\n\r\n3. College: Since before I graduated\
      \ high school I always wanted to go to college and try to further my education.\
      \ Towards the middle of my senior year after I had applied to Penn State my\
      \ step mother told me I wouldn't make it. She said that I wasn't made for college\
      \ and it would be hard for me to succeed. Immediately I became scared and worried\
      \ that she was right and took a year off after high school to work and practice\
      \ to get into a music school. I ended up learning a lot about life. Working\
      \ for a restaurant, retail, and the post office. A year turned into four and\
      \ I was approaching my one year mark at the post office with a pretty decent\
      \ pay and hours when I realized I wasn't happy. I didn't want to do this for\
      \ the rest of my life. So, I decided to go back to college and forget about\
      \ all my fears. My stepmother and father felt the same exact way as they did\
      \ when I graduated high school which only fueled my desire to succeed more.\
      \ Now, I am about a month into my first semester and I'm doing great so far\
      \ and I plan to graduate with my nursing degree.\r\n\r\nOverall, don't let anyone\
      \ tell you can't do anything because you can do anything with hard work and\
      \ determination. I know that is cliche but it's true.\r\nI would love to get\
      \ to know any of you and I'm here if anybody needs to talk or vent. It's a tough\
      \ world out there and sometimes we just need someone to listen.\r\n\r\nFeel\
      \ free to send you favorite song and/or artist to me and I'll return the favor:)\r\
      \n\r\nI hope you all have an amazing week!\r\n\r\n\r\nAnaiis\r\namf7692@yahoo.com\r\

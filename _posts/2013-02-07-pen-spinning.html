    No, not that.\r\n\r\nI mean hobbies. Mine is pen spinning. You may have seen people\
    \ doing it or even know a few tricks yourself. The range of tricks you can do\
    \ with a simple pen is amazing. If you want to see videos, there's plenty on YouTube\
    \ and you should look up 'vicgotgame', one of the best pen spinners in the world.\
    \ If you think it's awesome and want to find out more you can google \"upsb\"\
    \ which stands for Universal Pen Spinning Board.\r\n\r\nHere's a few reasons why\
    \ you should do it:\r\n- You can do it pretty much anywhere. All you need is a\
    \ pen.\r\n- It is fun. Learning new tricks and mastering them is very satisfying.\r\
    \n- When you start 'Modding' you'll have the coolest pens among your friends.\r\
    \n- Pen spinning will improve your finger dexterity and hand eye coordination.\
    \ Bonus especially after all the fun you'll be having.\r\n- Your coolness will\
    \ increase by a factor of 10,000. (According to 3 out of every 5 dentists)\r\n\
    \r\nIf you decide to start learning tricks, I suggest you start with the Thumbaround,\
    \ Charge or Sonic and go from there. And if it seems really difficult or you can't\
    \ get it right away, remember that with patience and persistence anything is possible.\
    \ This of course, also applies to everything in life.\r\n\r\nIf somebody else\
    \ can do it, so can you. You just haven't really tried. I hope you keep this in\
    \ mind whenever you want to try something new but you don't because you're afraid\
    \ you'll suck at it. It is ok to fail, because after failing, success will eventually\
    \ come. Maybe after 100 times or after 1 but you will succeed nonetheless if you're\
    \ patient and willing to put in the work. Patience and persistence people.\r\n\
    \r\nAs my mom would say: \"Nobody was born knowing it.\" We all had to learn at\
    \ some point.\r\n\r\nI hope that helped. Now, here are a few of favorite books\
    \ and authors:\r\nThe Hitchhiker's Series and Dirk Gently by Douglas Adams. Or\
    \ listen to the radio series.\r\nDiscworld Series by Terry Pratchett, yes all\
    \ of it\r\nA Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin. When is the new book\
    \ coming out GRRM???!!!\r\nFragile Things by Neil Gaiman, very good collection\
    \ of his short stories\r\nP.G. Wodehouse\r\nSherlock Holmes stories by Arthur\
    \ Conan Doyle\r\nLabyrinths by Jorge Luis Borges. The Lottery in Babylon and Tl\xF6\
    n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius are my favorite two\r\n\r\nFinally if you love EDM music\
    \ or even if you don't, you should listen to Moonbeam. They make amazing music\
    \ that is like nothing else. A few of my favorite tracks by them are: Spider's\
    \ Secret, Silence Interlude, Otaria Ursina, I Love Mornings, The Bats Eyes, Flickering\
    \ Ray, Liveliness, What Dreams May Come, When Flowers Talk and Symphony. Actually\
    \ there's a lot more because they're so good but that's already more than a few\
    \ so I'll let you discover more by yourself.\r\n\r\nThank you to all the listservers\
    \ for imparting wisdom and giving us a glimpse of your thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\nNyan\t\

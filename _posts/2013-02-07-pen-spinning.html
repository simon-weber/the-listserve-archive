<p>Let's talk about entertainment. Specifically self-entertainment.</p>
<p>No, not that.</p>
<p>I mean hobbies. Mine is pen spinning. You may have seen people doing it or even know a few tricks yourself. The range of tricks you can do with a simple pen is amazing. If you want to see videos, there's plenty on YouTube and you should look up 'vicgotgame', one of the best pen spinners in the world. If you think it's awesome and want to find out more you can google "upsb" which stands for Universal Pen Spinning Board.</p>
<p>Here's a few reasons why you should do it:<br />- You can do it pretty much anywhere. All you need is a pen.<br />- It is fun. Learning new tricks and mastering them is very satisfying.<br />- When you start 'Modding' you'll have the coolest pens among your friends.<br />- Pen spinning will improve your finger dexterity and hand eye coordination. Bonus especially after all the fun you'll be having.<br />- Your coolness will increase by a factor of 10,000. (According to 3 out of every 5 dentists)</p>
<p>If you decide to start learning tricks, I suggest you start with the Thumbaround, Charge or Sonic and go from there. And if it seems really difficult or you can't get it right away, remember that with patience and persistence anything is possible. This of course, also applies to everything in life.</p>
<p>If somebody else can do it, so can you. You just haven't really tried. I hope you keep this in mind whenever you want to try something new but you don't because you're afraid you'll suck at it. It is ok to fail, because after failing, success will eventually come. Maybe after 100 times or after 1 but you will succeed nonetheless if you're patient and willing to put in the work. Patience and persistence people.</p>
<p>As my mom would say: "Nobody was born knowing it." We all had to learn at some point.</p>
<p>I hope that helped. Now, here are a few of favorite books and authors:<br />The Hitchhiker's Series and Dirk Gently by Douglas Adams. Or listen to the radio series.<br />Discworld Series by Terry Pratchett, yes all of it<br />A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin. When is the new book coming out GRRM???!!!<br />Fragile Things by Neil Gaiman, very good collection of his short stories<br />P.G. Wodehouse<br />Sherlock Holmes stories by Arthur Conan Doyle<br />Labyrinths by Jorge Luis Borges. The Lottery in Babylon and Tl&#246;n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius are my favorite two</p>
<p>Finally if you love EDM music or even if you don't, you should listen to Moonbeam. They make amazing music that is like nothing else. A few of my favorite tracks by them are: Spider's Secret, Silence Interlude, Otaria Ursina, I Love Mornings, The Bats Eyes, Flickering Ray, Liveliness, What Dreams May Come, When Flowers Talk and Symphony. Actually there's a lot more because they're so good but that's already more than a few so I'll let you discover more by yourself.</p>
<p>Thank you to all the listservers for imparting wisdom and giving us a glimpse of your thoughts.</p>

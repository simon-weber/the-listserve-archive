    body: "For most of my life I wanted to live near the ocean. This was spurred on\
      \ by the fact that I lived in Scotland for 3 years in a town right on the North\
      \ Sea and had a brief stint living in Bermuda. I lived in both of these places\
      \ before I was 12. After that I spent the next 24 living in Ontario.\r\n\r\n\
      For most of my life, I have had a love affair with creating and performing.\
      \ Performing with bands, choirs, musical theatre etc. I wanted to pursue a career\
      \ in the arts.\r\n\r\nI pursued instead the ministry and for 18 plus years served\
      \ in various positions caring for youth. In that career I saw all aspects of\
      \ life, pain, misery, joy and success. I saw how when people believed in something\
      \ bigger than themselves amazing things could be accomplished. I also witnessed\
      \ how people can hide behind religion and do very dark things.\r\n\r\nI got\
      \ married to who was the love of my life, and when she was in a car accident\
      \ 3 years after, it changed both of our lives. I lost her that day. Short term\
      \ memory loss, Personality Change, Chronic Pain and PTSD. It was the hardest\
      \ thing I have ever had to go through. As we realized over the following 3 years\
      \ that we could not make it work.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the divorce, I stepped\
      \ down from ministry and began doing youth work in group homes eventually acting\
      \ as a live in foster dad. Then one winter day four years ago I was tobogganing\
      \ with the teens I worked with and broke my collarbone.\r\n\r\nI was burnt out\
      \ and broken, but I needed time to recuperate. So I did what any normal person\
      \ does with a broken shoulder, I went to Cancun, Mexico. I went ziplining, kayaking,\
      \ swam in a cenote (underground cave) and climbed up a temple. As I sat by the\
      \ ocean I realized that I was not living my life for me, but for others and\
      \ had just run out of steam to be good for anyone yet alone myself.\r\n\r\n\
      As I flew back I made a resolution to move to the ocean and start from there.\
      \ It was a start and I had no idea what it was going to bring. I packed my car\
      \ with everything I could fit in it and started the drive from Markham Ontario\
      \ to Victoria, British Columbia. I drove through the states and saw amazing\
      \ things, Mt. Rushmore, The Badlands and so much more. When I rode the ferry\
      \ across to Victoria, BC which is a small city on Vancouver Island. I knew I\
      \ was home. For the first time in a long time I was surrounded by the ocean.\r\
      \n\r\nItch number one: satisfied... this brings us to itch number two: the arts.\r\
      \n\r\nI was fortunate to make a group of friends quickly, they encouraged me\
      \ to go to an audition for a musical theatre company. I was sick and almost\
      \ didn't go. I did go and I was successful and my first show back was Miss Saigon.\
      \ A truly amazing experience. A friend I met through that connected me to Background\
      \ Performing as there was a major series coming to be filmed on the Island called\
      \ Gracepoint. My first day on set, I was standing next to Nick Nolte. I pinched\
      \ myself and said this was fun. (For those who know, yes I met the Doctor)\r\
      \n\r\nFast forward two years later, I am now working Full Time in the Film &\
      \ Television Industry here in Vancouver and without my Itches that would not\

      \ alas I have run out of words, but I leave you with these questions.\r\n\r\n\
      What is your Itch? What is stopping you from scratching it? Will it take a broken\

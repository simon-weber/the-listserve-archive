      <p>My name''s Kevin, and I write you from USS WAYNE E. MEYER, a US Navy<br />destroyer
      currently just getting started on a lengthy deployment in<br />the Pacific.
      I''m new to the Navy- I showed up to the ship two days<br />before we deployed
      a month ago- so I don''t have loads of sea stories,<br />but I''ve figured a
      little bit out.</p>

      <p>So what does the US Navy do on deployment? We spend a lot of time<br />training-
      far more than I would have guessed prior to coming aboard.<br />Damage control
      scenarios, man overboard scenarios, practice gun<br />shoots, briefs, and constant,
      non-stop flights by the helos embarked<br />for the length of the deployment-
      it makes for a pretty busy schedule!<br />But we''re out here to perform a variety
      of missions- to reassure our<br />allies of our commitment to the region, help
      keep the sea open for<br />international trade, respond to any crises slash
      natural disasters<br />that might arise, and more- so we have lots of training
      to do to be<br />prepared.</p>

      <p>Anyway, as one of King Neptune''s newest trusty shellbacks, I figured I<br
      />ought to teach you a bit about the ways of the Order of Neptune. You<br />see,
      when ships cross the Equator (as we did recently en route to<br />Tahiti), King

      The specific steps of this process are not<br />rightly sent out in an email
      to thousands of people, but it involves<br />the slimy pollywogs (that''s you)
      dressing up to entertain the crew''s<br />trusty shellbacks with song and dance.
      The next day the wogs are up<br />early to enjoy a special nautical breakfast,
      and then they must be<br />"cleansed" of their sliminess before their presentation
      to King<br />Neptune.</p>

      <p>Charlie Darwin himself crossed the line aboard the HMS Beagle in his<br />journeys

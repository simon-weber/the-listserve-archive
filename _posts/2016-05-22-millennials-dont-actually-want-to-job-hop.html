      How can employers find candidates that truly fit their values?\r\n\r\n- Ask\
      \ candidates where they see themselves in the future: Ask potential candidates\
      \ where they see themselves in five or ten years. Based on the candidate\u2019\
      s response, assess if the company can help the candidate get to that place or\
      \ not (Note: If the candidate gives a generic response, press for a more honest\
      \ answer).\r\n\r\n- Be honest about the company\u2019s culture: During interviews,\
      \ be honest about the company\u2019s culture. Some companies have work-life\
      \ balance, others don\u2019t. Some companies are more collegiate, other\u2019\
      s aren\u2019t. By communicating what the company is and is not, a candidate\
      \ will have a better sense of the company and whether they will be a good fit\
      \ or not.\r\n\r\n- Be honest about the type of candidate you are trying to hire:\
      \ During the interviews, communicate what type of candidate would be a great\
      \ fit for the job at hand and the company. Furthermore, after you explain that\
      \ to the candidate, ask them how they feel about that. By communicating the\
      \ type of person you want to hire to the candidate, they (and you) will be able\
      \ to assess whether or not the job would be a good fit for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\

      <p>In conversations with peers and through my own research, I believe that most
      millennials actually want job security and stability.</p>

      <p>So, why do millennials tend to switch jobs at a faster rate?</p>

      <p>Millennials want to work for a company where they truly &#8216;fit,&#8217;
      and many millennials have trouble finding that perfect company until the third
      or fourth time and they don&#8217;t like to settle. By fit, I mean an employee&#8217;s
      values should match the values and the mission of the company they are working
      for.</p>

      <p>Many millennials, for instance, deeply value learning and development from
      their employers and, at their first company, those millennials might not feel
      they are getting the types of developmental opportunities they need and seek
      a different opportunity.</p>

      <p>Shouldn&#8217;t it be easy for millennials to find a company that matches
      their values?</p>

      <p>There are a multitude of reasons why this occurs. Out of college, many millennials
      might not know exactly what type of company best suits their personality and
      it takes some time and professional experience to figure out. In addition, given
      the fluctuations of the economy sometimes you just have to take any job you
      can get.</p>

      <p>How can employers find candidates that truly fit their values?</p>

      <p>- Ask candidates where they see themselves in the future: Ask potential candidates
      where they see themselves in five or ten years. Based on the candidate&#8217;s
      response, assess if the company can help the candidate get to that place or
      not (Note: If the candidate gives a generic response, press for a more honest
      answer).</p>

      <p>- Be honest about the company&#8217;s culture: During interviews, be honest
      about the company&#8217;s culture. Some companies have work-life balance, others
      don&#8217;t. Some companies are more collegiate, other&#8217;s aren&#8217;t.
      By communicating what the company is and is not, a candidate will have a better
      sense of the company and whether they will be a good fit or not.</p>

      <p>- Be honest about the type of candidate you are trying to hire: During the
      interviews, communicate what type of candidate would be a great fit for the
      job at hand and the company. Furthermore, after you explain that to the candidate,
      ask them how they feel about that. By communicating the type of person you want
      to hire to the candidate, they (and you) will be able to assess whether or not
      the job would be a good fit for them.</p>

      Is that wrong? What if those memories were actually full of kind memories?  What
      if someone&#8217;s favorite memory was something kind that you, a complete stranger,
      did to make their day, week, month or even year?   I have many memories of people

      I think those experiences makes me a more kind person.</p>

      <p>Tonight I am surrounded by family and friends that have supported me through
      many good and many tough times. They have kept me from wallowing in my own negative
      history and provided many experiences of kindness to help heal the wounds.  The
      kind memories are what I WANT to filter.  As an ambivert (google it, it&#8217;s

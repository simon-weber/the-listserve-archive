<p>Hi! </p>
<p>I've wrote down a bunch of things I want to say/share with all of you but of all those things the following are what I've picked out as my top 7. Why 7? I don't know I like the number. </p>
<p>1) Checkout the short story Mrs. Wienckus by E.B. White (really anything by E.B. White...it's all good!)  <br />2) I believe everyone should use the Oxford comma!! Learn about, use it, and love it! (See what I did there?;)  <br />3) Try Swiss cheese in quesadillas...and sweet and sour sauce with chicken nuggets. <br />4) Always forgive your enemies because nothing annoys them so much   <br />5) The secret to making really good chocolate chip cookies is browning the butter vs. creaming it.  <br />6) Lazy people fact #492,928,392,103: you were too lazy to read that number.  <br />7) Fact: If you ask someone what a goatee is they will most likely stroke an outline of an imaginary one on their chin.</p>
<p>I hope you have a spectacular day! Remember to stay classy! </p>

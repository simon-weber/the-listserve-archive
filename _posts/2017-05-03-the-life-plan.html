    body: "From a wee little infant\r\nWe begin to decide\r\nWho we'll be when we're\
      \ older\r\nAnd our options are wide\r\n\r\nOur wants are confusing\r\nAnd rather\
      \ contrived\r\nHow can a 5 year old know what to strive for,\r\nWhen she doesn't\
      \ yet know who she is inside?\r\n\r\nSo we base our paths\r\nOn influences we're\
      \ supplied\r\nOpportunities begin to take shape\r\nFrom the great world outside\r\
      \n\r\nSome of us may \"know\"\r\nWhile most feel the great existential divide\r\
      \nCaught up in planning, Or\r\nEnjoying the ride?\r\n\r\n\r\nI myself decided\
      \ at 5\r\nThat I'd be that person,\r\nExperienced as I am NOW,\r\nBecause I\
      \ did in fact try\r\n\r\nNOW that I'm HERE\r\nI can look back with pride,\r\n\
      For following the path\r\nThat served as my guide\r\n\r\n(And HERE is where\
      \ I notice\r\nWe all need a guide\r\nTo help us make sense\r\nOf a life mystified)\r\
      \n\r\nYet being HERE NOW\r\nWhat the present supplied\r\nIs that my wants are\
      \ ever-changing\r\n\u2026from that my life amplified!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal is\
      \ now gone\r\nI am where I factored\r\nWhat's next to propel me\r\nTo write\
      \ my next chapter?\r\n\r\nWhile feeling content,\r\nYou can too feel complacent\r\
      \nAn achievement is great, though not the end\r\nFor that we must trust and\
      \ be patient\r\n\r\nTo search is to experience\r\nTo explore grows your soul\r\
      \nEach adventure turns emptiness,\r\nHoles, into the proverbial WHOLE\r\n\r\n\
      While I know I can't recall\r\nEvery last part of my passage\r\nThe outcome\
      \ has unquestionably\r\nLeft my spirit at a vantage\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ride is the\
      \ journey\r\nThe journey the key\r\nThe key has unlocked\r\nWhat's inside of\
      \ me\r\n\r\nAnd so our paths should be\r\nMove full speed ahead\r\nWhere you\
      \ too will find\r\nYour story's unread\r\n\r\nForget about later\r\nUnconcerned\
      \ by before\r\nThe present of presence is a\r\nVast room with no door\r\n\r\n\
      Truth is the answer\r\nBe candid, free\u2026 naked!\r\nTrust comes from knowing\r\
      \nActing out your inner self is fated\r\n\r\n\r\nCaught up in planning, Or\r\
      \nEnjoying the ride?\r\nWell that's the thing\r\nEvery choice is your guide\r\
      \n\r\nAct on an instinct\r\nPut your cowardice to rest\r\nNurturing your heart\r\
      \nWill diminish your ego and stress\r\n\r\nThe most stupendous part\r\nAbout\
      \ you freeing your inner you\r\nIs that family, friends, and strangers\r\nAre\

      \ my third time would be fully thought out, it would be about my release, but\
      \ more so about how I can better the people around me.  I came up with an idea\u2026\
      \ onePEACEofRHYME.  I hadn't yet started it, as I was slowly building the framework\
      \ and waiting for the right moment to begin this shared adventure.\r\n\r\nThe\
      \ idea is this: Each day I will post about one piece of something (the one thing\
      \ that jumps out to me that day) with a rhyme to match the feeling.  \"It's\
      \ a guide, not a definition.  Nothing is definitive in my journey.  I can't\
      \ and won't tell you what's what, just what I see.  The whole point is for you\
      \ to use my random guide to color in your own story.  This is a quest to find\

      \ my @onePEACEof brainstorm I joined The Listserve just 2 months ago to find\
      \ inspiration and perspective; I also immediately started working on a poem\

      \ I'd want to share with all of you.  Well\u2026 I finished it just 2 weeks\
      \ ago and then won The Listserve.  How's that for proof?\r\n\r\nIf you like\

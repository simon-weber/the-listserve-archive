    <p>I''m Alex and I''m a freelance web developer/consultant - a combination of
    telling people what to do on the internet &amp; actually doing it. But today I''m
    going to talk to you about how I became a nude photographer.</p>

    <p>Over the years I''ve smeared people with blackberries and stuck pinheads &amp;
    glowsticks to them. I''ve made human-sized cat cones and played with fire. There
    was a brief time when it seemed likely I''d become a professional pornographer.
    I''ve watched a friend get her lips sewn shut and then pose in a dank basement
    with a giant python - that one was her idea. But I''m getting ahead of myself.</p>

    <p>I''ve always been interested in photography but it wasn''t until my second
    year of university that my passion ignited. I was trying to impress a lady by
    teaching her to use a manual SLR. She remained unwooed, but I found a new way
    to express myself. I wanted to learn as much as possible, so I read voraciously
    and tried what I could. But one genre seemed out of reach: nudes.</p>

    them that you''re an artist, not a pervert? How do you find suitable locations?
    How do you direct them during the shoot? Where do you get your film developed?
    How do you make an image about tone and form and beauty, not just a random naked
    person feeling awkward?</p>

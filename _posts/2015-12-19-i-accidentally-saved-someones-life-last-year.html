    body: "One day last winter, in my employers big boring office building,\
      \ a cheese spread lured me into an unfamiliar conference room. Inside, someone\
      \ in a corduroy blazer approached me (my mouth full of smoked gouda) to ask\
      \ if i was willing to swab my cheek with a q-tip for some stem cell thingamajig.\
      \ So i said \"sure, swallowed my Gouda, swabbed my cheek, then promptly\
      \ forgot about the whole thing. A couple months later a strange email popped\
      \ up. Apparently this cheek swab had matched me with some 27 year\
      \ old stranger, whose life i was now being asked to save via a blood donation\
      \ thing. Huh? After roughly 10 seconds of half assed deliberation, I decided\
      \ to do it. Why not? I took a free train to DC, ran my blood through a crazy\
      \ Jetsons looking machine for a few hours, and then ate some pretty great free\
      \ pizza. Overall I'd say the experience, at worst, was mildly inconvenient.\r\
      \n\r\nI found out later that this 27 year old man was on his deathbed, but the\
      \ stem cell blood thingamajig worked, so now hes a cancer free weightlifter\
      \ (i get anonymous updates). In my mind, hes a totally awesome dude who\
      \ wears brightly colored tank tops. I am not a life saving type\
      \ of person. I don't volunteer. I hate giving blood. I am primarily motivated\
      \ by free cheese or beer. I knew nothing about stem cell donation or blood cancer\
      \ or that the two had anything to do with one another.\r\n\r\nBut this opportunity\
      \ was essentially handed to me on a platter with some smoked gouda, and now\
      \ its one of my proudest accomplishments. If I do nothing else with my\
      \ life, at least I helped save the life of one awesome dude who is most definitely\
      \ wearing a brightly colored tank top right now.\r\n\r\nSo now that I've\
      \ won the listserve lottery I'm handing you the same opportunity on a virtual\
      \ cheese platter. Here is some virtual cheese: [...]
      \ now I'm putting on my virtual corduroy blazer and asking you to spend\
      \ 60 seconds filling out a form on the internet:\r\n\r\nOPTION 1 (super easy,\
      \ this is mandatory): Register to be an organ donor:\r\n>>>ORGANIZE [dot] ORG<<<\r\
      \nNo swabs or blood or anything like that, and this company lets you do it online\
      \ in less than 60 seconds (no DMV visit necessary). This is by far the easiest\
      \ way to accidentally save a life.\r\n\r\nOPTION 2 (slightly more work): You\

      \ for trying. Note: i dont think they send cheese.\r\n\r\nOPTION 3 (for\
      \ the totally hardcore): You can register to be a living donor,\
      \ which means youd be willing to give a kidney to someone who desperately\

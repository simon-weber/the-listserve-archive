      \ by loss, twice.  We had taken our dog, whom we'd had for over 14 years, to\
      \ be put down.  He was a wedding gift from my husband to me.  He was our \"\"\
      baby\"\" before we had babies, and when each of our children joined the family,\
      \ he had no issues of jealousy or territory.  He accepted them instantly and\
      \ loved them, sleeping under their cribs, following me around the house while\
      \ I walked them to sleep, deftly avoiding them as crawlers and nascent walkers,\
      \ becoming an enthusiastic playmate and a reluctant dress-up companion as they\
      \ grew.  We moved him across an ocean with us and he took it in his happy stride.\
      \  His health had been gradually declining, with heart and kidney problems,\
      \ but at the end, he deteriorated very quickly.  When the vet told us there\
      \ was nothing more we could do but end his suffering, we felt shocked and desperate.\
      \  And those final moments with him, watching as he let go, were absolutely\
      \ heartbreaking, for all of us.\r\n\r\nAfter our heart-rending goodbye, we walked\
      \ home from the vet, raw and hollow.  Once we got home, I opened my email to\
      \ share the news with our friends and family, but instead I read a message that\
      \ my grief-stricken brain could not understand.  It said that Sweet Briar was\
      \ closing.\r\n\r\nThe significance of Sweet Briar College is nearly impossible\
      \ to capture on paper.  It is a tiny, rural, liberal arts college in the gorgeous,\
      \ rolling Blue Ridge foothills of central Virginia.  It is arrestingly beautiful,\
      \ stunningly peaceful, and uniquely nurturing.  It is a salvation, a refuge,\
      \ an inspiration, a motivation, and a home to those of us who are lucky enough\
      \ to know it.  I met my husband there (improbably, at a women's college), I\
      \ made many of my best friends there, I found my voice there. So many of us\
      \ who call ourselves \"\"Vixens\"\" know that the strength, determination, confidence,\
      \ and honor with which we carry ourselves as women were distilled and refined\
      \ during our years at Sweet Briar.\r\n\r\nThat evening, I closed my email without\
      \ reading the entire message, because I simply could not process it.  There\
      \ had been no warning, no indication of trouble or difficulty.  I was numb from\
      \ loss already and could not begin to comprehend.\r\n\r\nBut, the next morning,\
      \ I woke up not broken by loss or intimidated by the patronizing bluster of\
      \ false finality, but as the fierce, determined, confident woman Sweet Briar\
      \ had trained me to be.  And so did many, many of my alumnae sisters around\
      \ the world.  And we began to fight, and to question, and to unravel the decision\
      \ that had been made about our beloved alma mater.  Lawsuits were filed and\
      \ funds were raised.  Questions were asked and deceptions were challenged. \
      \ The \"\"reasons\"\" behind the decision were found to be largely baseless,\
      \ and we moved forward with a conviction that we would not let Sweet Briar go\
      \ quietly.  We shouted from the proverbial rooftops of social media and rallied\
      \ local and national newspapers to our cause.  Slowly, inch by inch, we took\
      \ back what was ours, and, with great effort and force of will, we won.  Sweet\
      \ Briar has been saved, and, reminded of what we so nearly lost, her alumnae\
      \ are freshly impassioned and more deeply committed.\r\n\r\nThey thought we\
      \ would not fight.  They never expected us to win.  But Sweet Briar taught us\
      \ to do what others might call impossible.  And so we did.\r\n\r\nEmily Calle\r\

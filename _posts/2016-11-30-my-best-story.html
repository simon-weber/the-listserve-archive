      \ out the quarter hour throughout the day, and sometimes a carillon of bells\
      \ performing a fight song. Everyone on campus knew that this was actually a\
      \ loudspeaker. And everyone including me and my friend Taylor wanted to get\
      \ in there and play whatever we wanted.\r\n\r\n\r\nTaylor had a way of making\
      \ big statements and promises, and somehow backing them up. One night we got\
      \ to chatting about the UC tower and its bells. He had promised everyone he\
      \ knew that he would change that music, but his plan was to go up there with\
      \ a hacksaw and see what he could do. I said that I had been thinking of the\
      \ same, but my plan was a bit more researched.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe west stairwell\
      \ under the tower had a curious locked door at the top which led up into the\
      \ heart of the tower. I could pop open a keybox without any damage and get a\
      \ keyring that let us navigate the locked stairwells. But the key to the curious\
      \ locked door was safely tucked away inside the big vault. Conveniently enough,\
      \ the combination to this vault was in the Rolodex. Doing some recon, we scurried\
      \ around the darkened building and made it to the door of interest. Beyond lay\
      \ the Verdin Singing Tower system, a complicated device full of lights, buttons,\
      \ LCD screens, locks, and an odd MIDI card. Surely we wouldn't have to deal\
      \ with all this old proprietary technology. Well, the whole thing was connected\
      \ to a simple amplifier by an RCA cable. From there it went up a ladder to the\
      \ loudspeakers above us. With our reconnaissance done and ideas brewing, we\
      \ safely returned the keys and exited the building to make our plans.\r\n\r\n\
      \r\nThe question was, how do you get a song to play when you want it to? We\
      \ came up with a simple idea using a technology that was already available:\
      \ the programmable CD player. The plan was to burn a CD with an hour of silence\
      \ as track 1 and tracks 2+ as our audio program. We program track 1 to play\
      \ twelve times from midnight, then our music starts at noon the next day.\r\n\
      \r\n\r\nThe night before we got our various keys and headed up to the closet.\
      \ The setup was simple. We unplugged the Singing Tower to power the CD player,\
      \ plugged it into the amp, and right on the dot of midnight I pressed play.\r\
      \n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, it might have been the chill in the air or the anticipation,\

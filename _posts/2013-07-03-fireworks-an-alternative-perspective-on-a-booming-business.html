    \ a spectacular show, literally risking their health and well being doing something\
    \ that they love.\r\n\r\nPlanning for a show (in the U.S.A. at least) typically\
    \ begins months in advance with client meetings and gathering of permits. Shows\
    \ can be specifically choreographed to music if the customer so desires. Costs\
    \ easily run into the tens of thousands of dollars for a show you might see in\
    \ your hometown on the 4th of July; basically the more rapidly shells are being\
    \ launched into the dark night sky, the more money it costs.\r\n\r\nThe day of\
    \ the show, work beings bright and early with equipment being loaded onto a truck\
    \ and driven to the show site (usually a big open field with little shade and\
    \ no bathrooms) where it is quickly unpacked. The \"Head Pyro\" uses a set of\
    \ printed plans to determine where certain sized shells will be launched from\
    \ on the field. Fireworks are launched from a tube which is secured inside a wooden\
    \ rack. Picture what a military mortar might looks like, except 5 to 8 attached\
    \ side by side pointed vertically. Each wooden rack weighs 20 to 30 lbs (or at\
    \ least they feel that heavy after a long hot day outside). Wooden cross braces\
    \ are nailed to each rack to prevent them from tipping over. This process, including\
    \ loading the actual fireworks into the tube takes the better part of the day.\r\
    \n\r\nExcitement and anxiety builds as showtime nears. The whole crew makes final\
    \ checks of the tubes, lining up fuses, and checking the stability of racks using\
    \ only the light from a headlamp or flashlight. Two minutes before the show begins\
    \ road flares attached to long metal handles, which are used to light the fuses,\
    \ are ignited, their red glow illuminating both the field and the crew who are\
    \ dressed head to toe in protective gear. Everyone is ready and more or less silent\
    \ - eagerly anticipating the go ahead to shoot. Patriotic music builds up in the\
    \ distance as the call finally comes in...\"FIRE!\" The first shells leave the\
    \ tubes with a deafening report, a bright flash, and a cloud of white smoke. The\

    <p>I am second year medical student. This is not my first time being in second
    year. Yes, I failed my examinations. And I chose to redo the year rather than
    re-sits. Why? Maybe I was/am crazy. It was just a lot culminating at me losing
    my footing. I forgot to stand up and fight back. I forgot to do what I had to.
    Anyway, I know better now. I don''t see it as a failure anymore. It is just everything
    never to do again for me. My parents don''t know I am repeating my year of study.
    In fact, most of my family and friends don''t. Instead, I chose to tell you guys.
    20000+ strangers, few I know and have met, but mostly strangers. </p>

    <p>I like to write in my spare time. Very very few people know this about me.
    I also love teaching. Here is something I wrote the other day.</p>

    <p>Parallels or crossing paths? Which one do you pick? On parallels you are equidistant
    yet unable to meet. Ever. Temptations teasing so close by. Fights and flailing
    at a distance. With cross paths you just meet once to maybe an explosion of souls.
    Then you move on to the unknown to never cross again. So which one do you choose?
    I say take neither. Pick a line and stay on it. Sometimes behind, sometimes ahead.
    Other times above if not below. Yet on the same path. Always. </p>

    <p>Sending you much love, <br />Amir</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am second year medical student. This is not my first time being in second year. Yes, I failed my examinations. And I chose to redo the year rather than re-sits. Why? Maybe I was/am crazy. It was just a lot culminating at me losing my footing. I forgot to stand up and fight back. I forgot to do what I had to. Anyway, I know better now. I don't see it as a failure anymore. It is just everything never to do again for me. My parents don't know I am repeating my year of study. In fact, most of my family and friends don't. Instead, I chose to tell you guys. 20000+ strangers, few I know and have met, but mostly strangers. </p>
<p>I like to write in my spare time. Very very few people know this about me. I also love teaching. Here is something I wrote the other day.</p>
<p>Parallels or crossing paths? Which one do you pick? On parallels you are equidistant yet unable to meet. Ever. Temptations teasing so close by. Fights and flailing at a distance. With cross paths you just meet once to maybe an explosion of souls. Then you move on to the unknown to never cross again. So which one do you choose? I say take neither. Pick a line and stay on it. Sometimes behind, sometimes ahead. Other times above if not below. Yet on the same path. Always. </p>
<p>Sending you much love, <br />Amir</p>

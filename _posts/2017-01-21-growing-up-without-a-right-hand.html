    body: "When my mom was 6 months pregnant with me, my parents found out I was missing\
      \ the right hand. I was going to be born with a stump below the elbow.\r\nFrom\
      \ what they told me, they took it hard, and it was very rough for them when\
      \ I was in the belly.\r\n\r\nI learned to walk at an early age, probably due\
      \ to my complications with trying to crawl, as I only had one hand.\r\n\r\n\
      They tried several times to introduce a prosthetic hand for me, but I never\
      \ wanted to wear them, I mostly threw them off. For most of my early childhood\
      \ I managed to do everything everyone else did at the same speed.\r\n\r\nWriting\
      \ on a keyboard fast took a lot of practice and my dad helped me a lot by introducing\
      \ touch typing with one hand (*ohh*, the fights we had when was typing the wrong\
      \ way).\r\nI painted a lot with my mom, mostly on large canvases. Sometimes\
      \ we went outside and painted whatever intrigued us. I did not realize it at\
      \ the time but looking back I really cherish those moments with mom.\r\n\r\n\
      In 2035, I was 18 years old. At that time, 3D printing of prosthetics had really\
      \ come a long way for people with my sort of disability.\r\nI started wearing\
      \ a black metallic hand that I could control exactly like a real hand. It even\
      \ has some sort of silicon texture over it to make it look real.\r\nSometimes\
      \ I still use only one hand, I still type better with one hand and I never sleep\
      \ with my prosthetic arm, it just feels weird.\r\n\r\nFour years later I met\
      \ my future wife when I was traveling. She is as beautiful as they come and\
      \ her smile just lights up the world. In 2043 we were that rare couple that\
      \ got married, and my wife is now pregnant with a child of our own.\r\n\r\n\
      My mom and dad were thrilled of the idea of becoming grandparents.\r\n\r\nOnce\
      \ you start thinking about having a child of your own you start thinking of\
      \ your own parents and upbringing. My mom and dad really did the best the could,\
      \ and sometimes loves me more than I want to be loved. Maybe sometimes less,\
      \ especially when I wanted that christmas gift I never got.\r\nSure they made\
      \ mistakes, but I\u2019m so grateful for the love, self-respect and discipline\
      \ they gave me and I could not wish for better parents. I sure hope I can be\
      \ as great a parent as they have been to me.\r\n\r\nNot that it matters at all,\
      \ but my daughter has both her hands intact.\r\n\r\nI have to go now, because\
      \ I can feel my daughter kicking inside the belly and it\u2019s incredible :).\r\

      In three months me and my wife will be the parent of a child with only one hand,\

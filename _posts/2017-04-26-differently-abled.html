      \ So what happened\_? How did I end up in the top 30 speakers among 30000 competitors\
      \ across the world \_?\r\n\r\nLet us rewind a little bit further. It all started\
      \ when I was a year and half old, I had just started running around causing\
      \ enough trouble to my mother. But then, suddenly I came down with a fever and\
      \ soon after I was diagnosed with Polio. My legs were paralyzed. Over the next\
      \ few years with intense physical therapy, I managed to walk but differently.\
      \ I was physically disabled often pitying my own life . I managed to get a good\
      \ job, family and was leading a good life but always wondered if I can ever\
      \ lead an inspirational life.\r\n\r\nThen something amazing happened in 2015.\
      \ I joined a Toastmaster club which is for people to improve public speaking.\
      \ I saw it as an amazing opportunity to meeting new people. One day, my Toastmaster\
      \ club president said \"You should participate in the International Speech Competition,\
      \ you have a story and you should share it\". I initially thought it would be\
      \ fun. I had no hopes of winning any contest because I was a novice. But alas\
      \ before I know it, I won the club, area, division and finally district contest.\
      \ How did a novice end up winning the district which comprises of 7500 members\
      \ with amazing veteran speakers\_? Although I didn't make it to finals, I finished\
      \ 3rd in my semifinal group ending up in the top 30 speakers in that year.\r\
      \n\r\nHow did it happen ? That is when it becomes interesting. You see, I didn\u2019\
      t participate to win, I didn\u2019t dream to give an amazing speech. I was simply\
      \ narrating my life. Did I think my life was inspirational\_? Hell no. But my\
      \ club members saw it different. They didn't see how I walked or struggled,\
      \ they saw what I said and how I survived. They helped me sculpt my speech.\
      \ They saw something in me which I was not seeing. They made me realize I was\
      \ differently abled not physically disabled.\r\n\r\nLife is not a movie, where\
      \ inspiration happens in distinct moments. In reality, we all lead simple lives,\
      \ surrounded by simple folks. I keep hearing if you want achieve something in\
      \ life, you have to surround yourself with inspiration people. Is that true\_\
      ? May be. But not all of us are lucky to have Elon Musk or Steve Jobs around.\
      \ That begs the question\_, so does it mean we the ordinary people cannot achieve\
      \ greatness\_? Is our life not inspirational enough\_? I thought so too until\
      \ I shared my life with others in my speech. They saw something in me, I failed\
      \ to see all these years. They were inspired by me, when I was not inspired\
      \ by myself.\r\n\r\nWe all have inspiration in our lives, just that we don't\
      \ realize it. Friends, we all have a story, a story that could inspire others.\
      \ We all have our faults, disabilities. But we don't realize the inspiration\
      \ around us, in us. We are all differently abled in our own beautiful unique\
      \ way.\r\n\r\nYou can see the speech 'Differently Abled' in my YouTube channel\

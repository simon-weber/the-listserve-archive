<p>I hate small talk.  It drives me nuts.  I&#8217;ll admit it, I&#8217;m basically anti-social.  I&#8217;ve struggled with it my whole life.  I am 27 now, and I feel that I should be less pessimistic, but I&#8217;m not.  I have a support system of family and a fianc&#233; who &#8220;get&#8221; me.  But, I have no friends of my own, though I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m a total freak.  I have two modes, I either open up completely to people who I shouldn&#8217;t because I see them as &#8220;different&#8221; or I dismiss people who I think are too &#8220;normal&#8221;.  I don&#8217;t know why I have a need to connect on a deep level.  It&#8217;s my eternal struggle and I just wanted to share it&#8230;</p>
<p>I lost my cousin earlier this year.  He was 23.  I wish he could have stuck around to become the person I know he was.  I put my cat down on Saturday.  I&#8217;ve had him &#189; of my life.  I miss you guys.</p>
<p>I perform improv in Chicago.  My fianc&#233; speculated that people in the comedy / improv community are probably more in tune to when people are depressed, etc. and are more likely to address it, because we either are / or have dealt with it at some point.  And&#8230;I agree.  I&#8217;m shy to a fault and I got into improv, begrudgingly, and honestly it is refreshing, I would love to get kids dealing with depression involved in it.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and here&#8217;s my self-promotion, I am a front-end web developer, I want to open a pickle shop, I want to start an animal charity program, I want to write / make performance art / make music / make art / make films.  Let&#8217;s see how that goes.</p>

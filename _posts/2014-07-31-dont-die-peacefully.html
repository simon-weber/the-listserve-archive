      \ he\u2019s diagnosed with cancer, our Sunday rides have become rare, but I\
      \ know that he will overcome it (He\u2019s already planning his three-month\
      \ motorcycle trip along the Silk Road (which stretches from India to China)).\
      \ This Listserve is dedicated to my passion for motorcycles, but more importantly,\
      \ my dad who has been a very important role model.\r\n            I will never\
      \ forget the first time I took my own bike on to the actual road and felt that\
      \ tire kiss the asphalt. I remember myself grinning ear to ear, tearing up in\
      \ the corners of my eyes, amazed at what I was doing. My heart raced and my\
      \ body was tense, yet my conscience was relaxed. Even on my first ride, functioning\
      \ the bike felt natural, like it was meant to be. It was almost like my life\
      \ was completed, even though I had the rest of my life ahead of me. Riding a\
      \ motorcycle is like a roller coaster but better. Like driving in a convertible\
      \ with the top down on a nice summer day, but better. It\u2019s like getting\
      \ an A on an essay, like landing that first date with a girl you\u2019re interested\
      \ in, like hot chocolate after playing in the snow for hours, but better. There\
      \ is nothing holding you back when you drive a motorcycle.\r\n            Owning\
      \ a motorcycle is not a matter of life or death. It is much more than that.\
      \ Its a definitional moment when you ride; who are you going to be, what are\
      \ you going to do, how are you going to do it?  If you've never ridden, it\u2019\
      s hard to comprehend what I am saying; but once you try it, I can guarantee\
      \ you will be hooked for life. Everything that is felt is enhanced. Your sense\
      \ of smells, sights, and feelings are stimulated to such an extreme that even\
      \ the familiar seems strange. The smells surround you like a gentle mist of\
      \ aromas. Everything that passes by tickles the sinuses. The smell of lilies,\
      \ streams, trees, and fields of wheat are euphoric. At the same time, the bike\
      \ is like the extension of your body. It\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re dancing\
      \ in between cars. You move back and forth, this way then that way, and everything\
      \ is in harmony - ground, bike, and self.\r\n            Why do I ride? It\u2019\
      s the thrill, the danger. But more importantly, it\u2019s a connection to my\
      \ dad. A short documentary I recently watched (I can provide a link upon request)\
      \ perfectly sums up why I ride. It goes something along the lines of: Every\
      \ time you climb on your bike and turn the engine on, you do not know whether\
      \ you will be arriving to your destination safely. But you cannot let the fear\
      \ of death stop you from doing things you love. We are only here for a while,\
      \ and we are the sum of our experiences; our experiences, our memories all tends\
      \ to blend together if we don\u2019t punctuate it with some adventure. Years\
      \ can slip by pretty fast. What did you do?\r\n            Feel free to reach\
      \ out to me for that link or to talk. Also, if anyone has advice for a current\
      \ sophomore in college, who is Pre-med/Majoring in Environmental Science, I\
      \ would really appreciate it. Cheers!\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter Schott\r\npetercschott@aol.com\r\

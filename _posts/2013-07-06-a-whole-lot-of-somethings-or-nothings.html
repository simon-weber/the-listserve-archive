<p>What I want to get most out of my ListServe opportunity is the chance to connect, so feel free to contact me with whatever&#8217;s on your mind (maybe read the rest of this before you do, though...).</p>
<p>I wanted to write something unique and intriguing, of course, but I&#8217;m rarely that creative. Probably tomorrow I&#8217;ll think of something fascinating I should have written. There&#8217;s a writing &#8216;experiment&#8217; further in. My introduction is at the end because it is typical and boring.</p>
<p>Try sunflower butter with honey on rye toast.</p>
<p>I intended the bulk of this e-mail to be about Tolkien and YouTube (as two separate topics, though now I wonder if there are any good Tolkien-focused YouTube channels?), but I really don&#8217;t know what to say about Tolkien other than I am utterly fascinated and enamoured with his creation of Middle-Earth and all that relates to it (I&#8217;m going to Oxford at the end of August as a kind of pilgrimage). I have a bit more to say about YouTube.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m always fascinated when people don&#8217;t understand YouTube in the same way I do &#8211; thinking it&#8217;s just for how to guides, silly clips or music videos. I wonder how many of you understand YouTube in this way? I hope you&#8217;d be impressed by amount of original quality content created for YouTube by ordinary people, and the communities that grow around that content. I would love for more people to experience this world. Hard to describe with words, just check out some YouTubers instead &#8211; for &#8216;beginners&#8217; I recommend kickthepj and charlieissocoollike. For something a little different, check out hexachordal. (Yes, they&#8217;re all popular British male YouTubers but off the top of my head I think they&#8217;re a good start). There&#8217;s a fantastic series running now called Becoming YouTube; I&#8217;m not sure how interesting it would be for someone who&#8217;s not already engaged with YouTube but you could check it out.</p>
<p>On a related note, shout out to Alan Lastufka, who doesn&#8217;t know me, but I&#8217;ve been a fan since fiveawesomeguys and he was how I found out about the Listserve.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll get no sage life advice or wisdom garnered through travelling from me, but here are some lyrics to keep in mind (&#8220;Show Starts Now&#8221; by Cloud Cult; Craig&#8217;s words help keep things in perspective):</p>
<p>Hold your breath for a better day and you&#8217;ll never learn to breathe<br />You&#8217;re afraid of the dark but that&#8217;s where you learn to see<br />You&#8217;re no good to the living if you&#8217;re too afraid to bleed<br />That&#8217;s why your show starts now</p>
<p>Message me (be patient for a reply) if the following is relevant to you, or if you want to know more:</p>
<p>&#183;         Tolkien fan</p>
<p>&#183;         Summer in the City</p>
<p>&#183;         WWOOF</p>
<p>&#183;         Writing as a personal activity</p>
<p>&#183;         Music (particularly Depeche Mode/Cloud Cult/AFP/Tom Milsom/Orphaned Land)</p>
<p>&#183;         Books (particularly Helen Oyeyemi/Cornelia Funke/Haruki Murakami/Catherynne M. Valente)</p>
<p>Since I wanted to include some type of interactive writing experiment, send me a piece of your writing and I&#8217;ll reinterpret/expand and send it back. Ask and I&#8217;ll send you a piece of mine.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m yet another Listserve participant who can&#8217;t believe they were chosen, can&#8217;t belive the timing, and isn&#8217;t at all prepared. I left my home on the Canadian prairies to WWOOF in Ireland on June 9, the most extreme experience in my life so far.  I find myself placed me in a position where, for the first time in my life, I have no easy internet access and very little time to spend on the computer. I am writing this in the three hours before it is due.</p>

      \ YouTube in this way? I hope you\u2019d be impressed by amount of original\
      \ quality content created for YouTube by ordinary people, and the communities\
      \ that grow around that content. I would love for more people to experience\
      \ this world. Hard to describe with words, just check out some YouTubers instead\
      \ \u2013 for \u2018beginners\u2019 I recommend kickthepj and charlieissocoollike.\
      \ For something a little different, check out hexachordal. (Yes, they\u2019\
      re all popular British male YouTubers but off the top of my head I think they\u2019\
      re a good start). There\u2019s a fantastic series running now called Becoming\
      \ YouTube; I\u2019m not sure how interesting it would be for someone who\u2019\
      s not already engaged with YouTube but you could check it out.\r\n\r\nOn a related\
      \ note, shout out to Alan Lastufka, who doesn\u2019t know me, but I\u2019ve\

      \ in the elbow by the fastest pitcher in our Regional. Getting hit really pissed\
      \ her off, so she stole second and third base on the next two pitches. The fire\
      \ in her eyes is one of my favorite coaching memories. Ky loved the sport. She\
      \ worked hard, always asking me to hit a few extra fly balls at the end of practices\
      \ in the summer. She was incredibly goofy, bringing infectious laughter to the\
      \ whole team, and was loved dearly by everyone. On a sunnySunday afternoon,\
      \ Kylie lost control of her vehicle. She wasn't speeding. She wasn't texting\
      \ or talking on her cell phone. A millisecond sooner or later and she would\
      \ have missed the tree that took her life. There isn't anything to blame or\
      \ a cause to get behind that would have prevented her accident. There is no\

      \ my hand while she administered drugs into his IV. Keith had always told us\
      \ it was okay to cry, and as a few tears slipped out with his pain, I handed\
      \ him a tissue. We laughed about how the first time he had a girl in his bed,\
      \ he was crying in front of her. Keith passed away two days later.\r\n\r\nI'm\

      \nI'm 27, I've been married for two weeks and two days, and I have incredibly\

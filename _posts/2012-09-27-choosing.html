<p class="meta">September 27 2012</p>

<p>This month marks the seventh anniversary of finding out I had multiple sclerosis.  I was stunned.  Irrationally, I was certain that I had already been through enough hard stuff, so I shouldn't have to deal with any more.  I lost an eye in a childhood accident.  I was widowed at the age of 39 and raised four children by myself.  But I worked my way to a lucrative career and we thrived.  Nothing kept me down.  Now, surely, this was my time of reward for surviving all those struggles.</p>
<p>Well, as we all know, life does not work like that.  There is no cosmic balance sheet of adversity vs. good fortune.  It was just my time to face another bad thing.  But I didn't want to, damn it!</p>
<p>The disease progressed and I started a downward spiral.  My high powered career and life began to crumble.  Loss mounted upon loss.  And I was consumed by bitterness and anger.</p>
<p>Devastated by my deterioration, I became virtually homebound.  Everything I loved was slipping away.</p>
<p>Full of resentment, I was tired of picking myself up.  But so many sources were sending me the same message: pray.  And if you can't pray, just say "Give me strength" over and over.  To not make the effort seemed like a slap in the face to all the people who love me and give me credit for being braver than I really am.  I knew I had to choose to pick myself up once again.</p>

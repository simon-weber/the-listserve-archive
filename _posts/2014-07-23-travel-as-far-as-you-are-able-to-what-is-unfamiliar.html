    body: "Greetings!\r\nI write to you all about one of my passions, travel.  I am\
      \ afflicted\r\nby what is likely the most amazing affliction possible, wanderlust.\
      \  I\r\nam fascinated & fixated on exploring this planet as often as possible.\r\
      \nBeing able to see & experience places that are vastly different from\r\nwhere\
      \ I've lived puts everything in a new perspective.  You learn to\r\nappreciate\
      \ what you have, or to realize that there are better ways of\r\ndoing things.\
      \  You understand why some places are the way they are, or\r\nlearn that some\
      \ parts of the world defy understanding.  Travelling to\r\nnew & unfamiliar\
      \ places makes you a better person.\r\n\r\nI know that not everyone has the\
      \ means to travel to distant lands.\r\nBut you don't need to.  Sometimes going\
      \ somewhere unfamiliar means\r\ndriving for a few hours to a place that is unlike\
      \ where you live\r\n(different scenery, different culture, different language,\
      \ etc).  Or\r\ngo hiking & explore a forest, desert, beach, or grassland that\
      \ you've\r\nnever seen up close before.  Wander to a new part of your town or\
      \ city\r\nthat you've never been to before, or get on a public bus, subway,\
      \ or\r\neven a taxi, and check out a part of your city, province, state or\r\
      \nregion that is unfamiliar to you.  Just go somewhere that is new, and\r\n\
      take it all in.  Additionally, travelling does not have to be a group\r\nactivity.\
      \  While there are benefits to travelling with one or more\r\nfriends or loved\
      \ ones, travelling solo has its own rewards & benefits.\r\nSure, it requires\
      \ some more courage, it can put you much further out\r\nof your comfort zone,\
      \ but in the end, you'll learn more about yourself\r\n(and if you learn that\
      \ you simply hate travelling alone, that's\r\nworthwhile knowing from experience\
      \ too).\r\n\r\nMy favorite/recommended travel destinations:\r\n* South Korea:\
      \ China & Japan get a lot of the hype & buzz, but this\r\nsmall nation is amazing.\
      \  The people are friendly, the culture is\r\ninteresting, and the food is delicious\r\
      \n* Estonia: western Europe gets all the attention, but this ex-Soviet\r\nera\
      \ country is quirky, fascinating & fun\r\n* Australia: I spent a month, a year\
      \ ago, driving a campervan over\r\n9000km all around, and had the most amazing\
      \ time.  Its a huge place,\r\nwith so much to see & experience\r\n* Tanzania:\
      \ my first experience in Africa, and I'm yearning to return.\r\nIts wild, wonderful\
      \ & unlike what most expect\r\n\r\nWhere to next?  Oman & Dubai in September,\
      \ quite likely Cambodia in\r\nJanuary, and I'm hoping to get to Antarctica in\
      \ December of 2015.  If\r\nyou've been to any of these places already, please\
      \ share your tips,\r\nwarnings, & recommendations (places to see, sleep or eat,\
      \ people to\r\nmeet, etc).\r\n\r\nAlmost as much as I love to travel, I enjoy\
      \ hearing about other\r\npeople's travels.  The next best thing to going somewhere\
      \ new, is\r\nhearing about your adventures.  I'd love to hear from any of you\
      \ with\r\na great travel story:\r\n* Where have you gone that absolutely amazed\
      \ you (and why)?\r\n* Where have you gone that didn't live up to the expectations\
      \ (and why)?\r\n* If you have photos of your travels online somewhere, I'd love\
      \ to see\r\nthem.  Even better if there are stories to go with them.\r\n\r\n\
      When I'm not seeing the world, I'm an engineer at a Silicon Valley\r\ntech company.\
      \  Want to chat about anything?  I'm on twitter\r\n(@netllama), or try simply\

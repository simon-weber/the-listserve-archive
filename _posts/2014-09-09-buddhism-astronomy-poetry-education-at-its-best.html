      \n     Somebody who I'm close with once read me a six word memoir that went\
      \ something like; 'Religion is meaningful, irrational, convince me.'\r\n   \
      \  I agree with the first two parts of his statement, but this idea of convincing\
      \ doesn't always sit well with me. Religion does grant meaning in regards to\
      \ providing a context for social interaction as well as life-cycle meaning to\
      \ the human condition.\r\n     I also firmly believe that belief in the divine\
      \ is to a certain extent irrational, because of a few inherent contradictions\
      \ (good things happen to bad people etc). However, the attitude of the last\
      \ two words of \u201Cconvince me\u201D is not necessarily the best way to go\
      \ about approaching religious, education, and honestly any sort of education.\r\
      \n     I worked as a writing tutor. I had one student who would bring in these\
      \ fantastic conceptual ideas like explaining how conservation and awareness\
      \ of nature can even extend to outer space. His ideas were great, but his writing\
      \ organization could have used some work. I couldn't just hit him over the head\
      \ with a blunt instrument of thesis statements. Teachers and tutors should not\
      \ (usually) be barbarians. We need to practice finer arts of swordsmanship,\
      \ and lead our students into understanding how to be better people, or better\
      \ writers (if the two aren't the same thing already).\r\n     In other words,\
      \ we can't settle for just trying to convince people of certain things (the\
      \ existence of God, how to be better writers, chemists, teacher, thinkers, vikings)\
      \ we have to lead them to the proper understanding of truth. This can be done\
      \ through didactic methods such as leading the class through questions. It can\
      \ also be achieved through interaction with artistic mediums that relate to\
      \ the source materials. I took a poetry course and astronomy simultaneously.\
      \ During that semester, I tried to incorporate elements of astronomy into my\
      \ poetry as well as try and interpret poems through the lens of astronomy. I\
      \ think educators when writing curriculums need to foster a cross-flow between\
      \ subjects.\r\n     As an Orthodox Jew, I would like to speak about Buddhism\
      \ and how it can help us understand my approach to education. There's an idea\
      \ of prajnaparamita in Mahayanna Buddhism. It refers to the perfection wisdom\
      \ and deals with what truth really is. I won't get into that stuff so much,\
      \ but basically it means that there is an understanding of reality that goes\
      \ beyond deep conceptual knowledge. Most buddhism will say that the world is\
      \ only first hand experience. Concepts and ideas are all second hand. While\
      \ I think the Buddhist sense of ultimate knowledge goes deeper than how I am\
      \ applying it, the message of multiple levels to truth is still applicable to\
      \ teaching. While we can't always give our students first hand experience (Edgar\
      \ Allen Poe can't teach the class or read his work anymore) we can help make\
      \ the experience of a classroom a more inviting,engaging, and enjoyable place\
      \ for students.\r\n     I'm a senior in college majoring in English, and enjoy\
      \ thinking about and discussing these things. If anyone has actually read through\

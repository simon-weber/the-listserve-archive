    body: "When I was 7 years old, I got the word \"minute\" wrong on a spelling quiz.\
      \ It wasn\u2019t fair: the teacher hadn\u2019t taught me how to spell the word\
      \ and made me take the test anyway. But instead of getting over it, I begged\
      \ my mom to transfer me to another school.\r\n\r\nSee, by that point my single\
      \ mom and I had already moved more than half a dozen times that year. We changed\
      \ cities every few weeks as my mom sought treatment for her brain injury. Sometimes\
      \ we slept on cots in crowded churches or battered women's shelters. One weekend\
      \ we stayed in a luxury hotel through some wealthy donor\u2019s generosity.\
      \ After we landed on our feet and had several years of stability, high school\
      \ saw me move cross-country and change schools again every fall.\r\n\r\nAll\
      \ this moving around had a big impact on me. School was the one area of my life\
      \ where I had control. Great teachers like Thomas Brown at South Fallsburg Jr./Sr.\
      \ High (thank you Mr. B!) inspired me to devote my weekends to the SATs and\
      \ apply to top colleges. With his help in particular, I got a full-ride scholarship\
      \ to an Ivy League university. Today, thanks in no small part to socioeconomic\
      \ affirmative action, I\u2019m a student at Harvard Law School.\r\n\r\nBut there\
      \ were serious downsides to always being the new kid. I found it easier to teach\
      \ myself material for AP exams than to form new friendships over and over again.\
      \ I acted goofy for attention but struggled with loneliness and awkwardness.\
      \ Weird nicknames grew on me like barnacles: \u201CElmer,\u201D \u201CShakespeare,\u201D\
      \ \u201CBush.\u201D Early in college I still struggled to make friends and took\
      \ refuge in a string of intense but impermanent romantic relationships. With\
      \ few deep friendships or family ties, I had little experience dealing with\
      \ conflict and prioritizing relationships over \u201Cwinning.\u201D\r\n\r\n\
      I like to think that I\u2019m well adjusted these days, but I still have my\
      \ cringe-worthy moments. (Like this email, in all likelihood.) For anyone else\
      \ who has ever felt like they could have better social skills, here\u2019s some\
      \ advice that has helped me overcome my baggage:\r\n\r\n- Attend a Vipassana\
      \ meditation course. I went on a 10-day retreat and walked out feeling like\
      \ a different person. College / graduate students out there: go during a summer\
      \ break before you have to use up vacation days! Don\u2019t worry about costs,\
      \ it\u2019s donation-based and carpooling is available. Just do it!\r\n\r\n\
      - Practice meditating daily, even if only for 1 minute (ideally 10+). Meditation\
      \ builds focus, compassion, and peace. The Headspace app is great for beginners.\r\
      \n\r\n- Take improv classes. Businesses hire improv instructors for a reason:\
      \ improv teaches key skills like presence, communication, and empathy. (If you\
      \ don\u2019t live near a class, consider Toastmasters.)\r\n\r\n- To get better\
      \ at healthy, proactive assertiveness, read \u201CDifficult Conversations\u201D\
      \ and \u201CBeyond Winning\u201D (the chapter on the empathy-assertiveness tension).\r\
      \n\r\n- When facing an impulse (Reddit, gossip, mosquito bites, etc.), don\u2019\
      t give in reactively or ignore it; instead really pay attention to that sensation\
      \ and \u201Csurf the urge.\u201D\r\n\r\n- Forgive yourself when you fail. It\u2019\

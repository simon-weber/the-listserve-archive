<p>When I ask questions, I am genuinely curious to hear the answers. How are you today? Don&#8217;t say fine. Tell me what you were anticipating to be stressful at work today, or what you are looking forward to doing this evening. My favourite question to ask is &#8220;What are you passionate about?&#8221; It stumps people most of the time. This upsets me because I don&#8217;t like to see a disconnect between someone and what makes them the most happy and curious in life. Your passions should always be within arm&#8217;s reach. Once I get the ball rolling and someone begins opening up to me, I like to think that I&#8217;ve lightened their mood and distracted them from whatever negative thoughts were tossing in their heads. Maybe when they&#8217;re done speaking to me, they continue the conversation within themselves. Perhaps they had lost touch with what they are passionate about and I helped rekindle their fire.</p>
<p>I initially wanted to write about what was a long distance relationship between my boyfriend and I, but is now local. 286 days in our first year were spent with him in Ottawa and me in Vancouver. I&#8217;m also passionate about science (physics, biology, evolution), hockey, Sweden, feminism, body positivity, blood donation, and awareness of depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>So tell me: What are you passionate about?</p>
<p>I want to start interacting with the readers and writers of the Listserve by sending emails. Maybe it&#8217;ll become a passion of mine.</p>

    body: "I\u2019m 23 years old.\r\n\r\nI graduated from Westmont College with a\
      \ degree in Liberal Studies (= non-committal/elementary education).\r\n\r\n\
      I\u2019m married without children. (Full disclosure: sometimes I carry my dog\
      \ around like a baby.)\r\n\r\nI anticipate that when this is published my mother\
      \ Gail will read it, possibly take a few moments to realize that this is, in\
      \ fact, her daughter writing, and then she\u2019ll call me and we\u2019ll laugh\
      \ about it because we are, as she says, \u201Csympatico\u201D. Love you mama!\r\
      \n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t~\r\n\r\nI\u2019m a doula. It\u2019s Greek for \u201C\
      a woman who serves\u201D. My job description is Professional Birth and Postpartum\
      \ Support Person.\r\n\r\nIt means that I attend births. I massage and braid\
      \ hair and remind everyone to take a sip of water. I sway and count and breath\
      \ to match the laboring mother\u2019s pace. I tell her to reach down and feel\
      \ her baby\u2019s head. I watch babies take their first breath. Sometimes I\
      \ pace the halls waiting to be escorted to a post-op recovery room. I take pictures\
      \ and see the room erupt in tears and smiles. I witness families expand and\
      \ double their capacity for love. I see women transform into mothers, and I\
      \ share her \u201Cbirth high\u201D- there is oxytocin and adrenaline coursing\
      \ through every vein in the room.\r\n\r\nIt means that I\u2019m a birth nerd.\
      \ I watch documentaries about the infant microbiome, breastfeeding, and home\
      \ birth. I search youtube for vaginal breech delivery videos. I read books about\
      \ maternity care in the US and the midwifery model of care. I research holistic\
      \ care for pregnancy. I am obsessed with learning more about how women can GROW\
      \ NEW HUMANS in their bodies. It\u2019s fascinating.\r\n\r\nIt means that I\u2019\
      m a friend. I hug, listen to, and cry with mamas when they share their birth\
      \ story. I spend long nights rocking fussy babies so their parents can sleep.\
      \ I watch babies \u201Clatch on\u201D and remind mamas to relax their shoulders\
      \ as they nurse. I wash bottles and fold tiny baby laundry. I tag along grocery\
      \ shopping and to doctors appointments so a new mama doesn\u2019t have to go\
      \ alone. I\u2019m present and available, and I understand that the 4th trimester\
      \ is hard.\r\n\r\nIt means that I am a business owner. I create contracts and\
      \ confidentiality releases. I hold liability insurance. I pay dues to networking\
      \ organizations. I am self-employed, and file taxes as such (wah wah).\r\n\r\
      \nIt means that I am participating in something as old as human existence, but\
      \ that is new every day. I am part of the changing birth culture in San Diego,\
      \ in California, and in the US. I work alongside other doulas, midwives, childbirth\
      \ educators, lactation consultants, body workers, nurses, obstetricians, and\
      \ mothers who are PASSIONATE about improving birth.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s demanding,\
      \ beautiful, fulfilling work. I do it because birth matters.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\
      \t\t\t\t\t~\r\n\r\nIf you want to chat about anything relating to birth (including\
      \ but not limited to finding a doula or becoming a doula), please connect with\
      \ me! I\u2019ll even share my favorite birth videos with you. ;)\r\n\r\nBest,\r\

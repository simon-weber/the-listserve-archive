    body: "My mother is from an island called Brac in Croatia. It is truly a remarkably\
      \ beautiful place.\r\n\r\nShe didn't own a pair of shoes until she was maybe\
      \ 8 years old. She told me that for Christmas they may, if they were good, get\
      \ an apple or a fig as a present.\r\n\r\nHer father was a simple man, favouring\
      \ the communist party and not terribly in favour of the catholic church. He\
      \ worked the land and grew olives, figs and grapes. He wasn't a man that showed\
      \ affection to either his wife or children and although he put the fear of God\
      \ in all of them, my mother speaks of him very fondly.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother\
      \ was a Catholic and a kind and gentle woman as I remember her. That doesn't\
      \ mean she wasn't afraid to scold any one of her 11 children and although my\
      \ mother speaks of her with the greatest love and respect, she tells me there\
      \ were times that she knew very well she wasn't in the good books.\r\n\r\nThey\
      \  lived through 2 wars, never had any wealth to speak of and worked hard on\
      \ the land.\r\n\r\nMy grandmother lost 6 of 11 children. When the Germans invaded\
      \ and took over the villages she was forced to flee to Italy for almost 2 years\
      \ with her children to survive.\r\n\r\nMy mother left Croatia in her late 20's\
      \ without a word of English. She was asked to keep company an aunt in Rhodesia\
      \ who had lost her husband. She would pay for her flight and return and all\
      \ expenses whilst there but got used to having a servant and refused to pay\
      \ for my mother to return home.\r\n\r\nEventually she learned English, got a\
      \ job and met my father.\r\n\r\nAlthough he was an only child and his life was\
      \ somewhat easier than hers.\r\n\r\nMy father\u2019s parents also lived through\
      \ 2 wars in England, both served in the 2nd and worked very hard all their lives.\
      \ Their families are from lower middle class backgrounds. My real grandfather\
      \ died in his late 20's from a disease similar to multiple sclerosis I believe.\
      \ My grandmother remarried to a RAF serviceman she met during the war.\r\n\r\
      \nMy father grew up relatively comfortably in Cape Town as I did in Perth, Western\
      \ Australia. Worked consistently all his life and still does at 68, had 3 children\
      \ of which I am the eldest. We didn\u2019t have a lot but we certainly didn\u2019\
      t go without.\r\n\r\nI also work hard. I always have but have not always been\
      \ successful. Now I have a business that employs 4 people and growing. Things\
      \ are looking good.\r\n\r\nLife doesn't always seem easy for me, stress from\
      \ work, long hours, a child to raise, high cost of living and so on. A constant\
      \ battle.\r\n\r\nBut when I reflect on what my parent and grandparents went\
      \ through in their lives, I can only be thankful for what I have.\r\n\r\nI have\
      \ learned from their example to be honest, work hard, persistent, consistent,\
      \ be reliable and do as you say you will.\r\n\r\nOn my own I have learned that\
      \ working hard does not lead to success. Education, planning, creativity, ingenuity\
      \ and a thick skin are good foundations for success.\r\n\r\nYoung people: open\
      \ your eyes to the opportunities available to you today. These are a result\
      \ of our parents, grandparents and great grandparents hard work and sacrifices.\r\
      \n\r\nRemember the important things in life and don't take anything for granted.\r\
      \n\r\nAnything you have in this world can be taken from you in the blink of\
      \ an eye.\r\n\r\n\r\nNeal Meldrum\t\r\nnealmeldrum@gmail.com\t\r\nSydney, Australia\r\

    \ but by no means do I live an unfulfilled life. I\u2019ve found in my short,\
    \ but fun filled existence that if you want to do something then you should never\
    \ let things hold you back.\r\n\r\n             I know there are certain circumstances\
    \ which don\u2019t allow you to fulfil goals and objectives, but surely there\u2019\
    s a way around them? A lot of the time we\u2019re creating our own barriers that\
    \ hold us back because were too comfortable in what we know. So I challenge you,\
    \ the reader to go out there and do something different, something that gets you\
    \ one step further to what you want out of life, and do it with a smile on your\
    \ face, because as a drunken man once said to me \u201CWhy are you young ones\
    \ so angry?\u201D\r\n\r\n             Another thing I\u2019ve learnt so far is\
    \ never to be jealous of others. It\u2019s the easiest way to bring yourself down.\
    \ Just be comfortable with what you can, or even can\u2019t do and take solace\
    \ in the fact that somebody will be jealous of you at some point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    Many thanks for reading, Matt.\r\nmattymoomoomoo@hotmail.co.uk\t\r\nU.K\r\n\r\n\
    P.S If anybody out there knows of any theatre comedies that aren\u2019t well known,\
    \ please feel free  to send them my way, as I am very. VERY stuck for a script\
    \ to use in my final year of University J\r\n\r\nP.P.P.S. Go team GB in the Paralympics!\r\

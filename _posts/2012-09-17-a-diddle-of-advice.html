<p>So as a recently turned 21 year old, I feel I don't know as much as almost everybody else here on the listserve. I have no wise words, no humbling story, but by no means do I live an unfulfilled life. I&#8217;ve found in my short, but fun filled existence that if you want to do something then you should never let things hold you back.</p>
<p>             I know there are certain circumstances which don&#8217;t allow you to fulfil goals and objectives, but surely there&#8217;s a way around them? A lot of the time we&#8217;re creating our own barriers that hold us back because were too comfortable in what we know. So I challenge you, the reader to go out there and do something different, something that gets you one step further to what you want out of life, and do it with a smile on your face, because as a drunken man once said to me &#8220;Why are you young ones so angry?&#8221;</p>
<p>             Another thing I&#8217;ve learnt so far is never to be jealous of others. It&#8217;s the easiest way to bring yourself down. Just be comfortable with what you can, or even can&#8217;t do and take solace in the fact that somebody will be jealous of you at some point.</p>

<p>P.S If anybody out there knows of any theatre comedies that aren&#8217;t well known, please feel free  to send them my way, as I am very. VERY stuck for a script to use in my final year of University J</p>
<p>P.P.P.S. Go team GB in the Paralympics!</p>

      <p>I have a running list of 100+ startup ideas that are locked and loaded, but
      I&#8217;ll never be able to execute all of them, so I decided to use this opportunity

      let me know. I&#8217;m happy to support and would love to know how they&#8217;re
      going.</p>

      <p><br />1. Device: Ever ran out of battery and didn&#8217;t have a charger

      <p>3. App: Get up! A social network that motivates you to get up early in the
      morning. You can share the time you set your alarm and see which of your friends

  body: "I didn't go to church until I was in college. Spirituality was not really\
    \ a part of my life, nor did I feel like it was missing. But I am a generally\
    \ curious person, so in college I tried a Catholic mass or two, and then a friend\
    \ took me to the Unitarian Church. I have found my sporadic visits to UU Churches\
    \ fulfilling and thought-provoking. In fact, a few services-- in particular ones\
    \ about the first principle of Unitarianism-- have moved me to tears (which was\
    \ hella embarrassing, crying in public). The first principle simply states that\
    \ 'We, the member congregations of the UUA, covenant to affirm and promote the\
    \ inherent worth and dignity of every person.' This is, really, a very strong\
    \ covenant. People do many beautiful things, but damned if we don't also do a\
    \ ton of terrible things. Promoting the inherent worth and dignity of people who\
    \ we like is easy, but what about those who have done, and continue to do, things\
    \ we find morally repugnant?\r\n\r\nOne thing very difficult about living by the\
    \ first principle is that you can no longer submit to black-and-white characterizations\
    \ of things (which one may notice, are constantly being foisted on us). We often\
    \ surround ourselves with like-minded people who affirm our values and conclusions\
    \ about the world. This makes sense for a lot of reasons-- it is more comfortable\
    \ to be around people you generally agree with (reduces conflict), and it is optimal\
    \ for making progress towards common goals. On the other hand, it makes it easy\
    \ to get entrenched in your own ideology-- and we all have ideologies. It also\
    \ makes it easy to think of those with different views as caricatures instead\
    \ of as humans. Simplifying others\u2019 perspectives instead of trying to understand,\
    \ seeing them as cartoons, instead of human and worthy of our consideration.\r\
    \n\r\nWhat's the good in living in such black and white? It makes things easier\
    \ (shit\u2019s mad complex, yo!)\u2014but also makes it easier to write off. Ideas\
    \ that I haven\u2019t heard about on tv or at school? Write \u2018em off cause\
    \ they\u2019re crazy, that\u2019s what everybody else is doing, and it is easy.\
    \ But it takes us away from the truth.\r\n\r\nI have also found that, when I turn\
    \ harsh critical thoughts towards others, it is often the case that I am really\
    \ having critical thoughts about myself. Learning to be less critical of others,\
    \ and start appreciating their humanity instead, also gives us the room to be\
    \ less critical of ourselves and start accepting ourselves in a more honest way--\
    \ flaws and all.\r\n\r\nLast, just some words about practical things I've found\
    \ to promote happiness and well-being in my life:\r\n\r\n1. Bicycling in lieu\
    \ of driving-- and also learning bike repair skills (many cities have some sort\
    \ of free workshop program where you can learn for free or cheap).\r\n\r\n2. Spending\
    \ time outside and moving every day (get some sun, especially in the winter, just\
    \ bundle up real good!)\r\n\r\n3. Yoga cured my life-long asthma, and I am dead\
    \ serious about it. My whole life, I had needed medication multiple times a day\
    \ and exercise was painfully associated with completely losing my breath. Yoga\
    \ (not aerobic-lose-weight yoga, but moving-focusing-breathing yoga) damn-near\
    \ eliminated my need for medicine and I felt physically reborn. I was skeptical\
    \ at first, but there is wisdom in those ancient practices.\r\n\r\n4. Buying less\
    \ stuff (the less often you go to stores, the less stuff you want to buy! It\u2019\
    s like they designed the stores to make you want stuff you don\u2019t need or\
    \ something\u2026)\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for reading and best wishes to everyone,\
    \ I've really enjoyed reading what everyone has to say.\r\n\r\n\r\nLaura\t\r\n\

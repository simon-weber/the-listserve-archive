      \ and fires.\r\n\r\nBut no, it was a recipe from the New York Times. They actually\

      \ they can carry any flavor. I like what they communicate: the simplicity of\
      \ caring, the effort and emotion, the warmth of that glowing oven in the winter\
      \ or sitting on the porch in the summer, an occasional breeze the only respite\
      \ from the heat. Biscuits remind you of something you love and yearn for, or\
      \ something you cherish and have.\r\n\r\nThey also taste good.\r\n\r\nAnyway,\
      \ here's the recipe. My kitchen witch modifications are in parentheses.\r\n\r\
      \n-2 cups all purpose flour (1 2/3 c flour + 1/3 c corn meal or masa)\r\n-2\
      \ tablespoons baking powder\r\n-1 tablespoon sugar (honey or maple syrup)\r\n\
      -1 teaspoon salt\r\n-5 tablespoons butter (8 tbsp butter)\r\n-1 cup whole milk\
      \ (rice milk)\r\n\r\n1) Mix dry stuff in a bowl. (If using liquid sweetener,\
      \ mix that into the milk.)\r\n\r\n2) Cut butter into smaller pieces. I cut the\
      \ stick in quarters length-wise, and then into cubes.\r\n\r\n3) \"Cut the butter\
      \ into the flour.\" You can do this the traditional way (with two butter knives),\
      \ a pastry cutter, or a food processor. If you want to do it my way, wash your\
      \ hands thoroughly, then just mash everything together with your fingers. \r\
      \n\r\n4) Once it looks uniformish, add milk and mix it some more. Let it be\
      \ uneven and messy. It will taste good.\r\n\r\n5) You can roll it out using\
      \ a rolling pin (or empty bottle of Jameson (do not rush to empty it just for\
      \ this)), and cut out pretty biscuit rounds using a cup. I usually take a 1/2\
      \ or 1/3 cup, scoop a bit of dough and place on a baking tray.\r\n\r\n5.1) Just\
      \ kidding, my baking tray is a cast iron pan. If you're like me, you'll enjoy\
      \ cooking them in a cast iron pan. Feel free to use a baking tray though.\r\n\
      \r\n6) Bake 10-15 minutes at 425 f (218.3 c). They're done once they look done.\r\
      \n\r\nWhat's good about any recipe is that you can change it, tweak it, and\

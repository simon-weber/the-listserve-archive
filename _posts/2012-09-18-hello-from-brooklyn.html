<p>Everyday I am fascinated by the Listserve responses. Although I assume it is filtered to protect against hateful, sexual, prejudicial, racial, etc. emails, I am fascinated by what wonderful things people can squeeze into about 200 words.<br />I am no poet or philosopher so I can only offer you these words of wisdom : Don't allow yourself to become stuck in an endless cycle of negativity. Things will not change unless you change them. Stop and ask yourself, 'Do I really want to go down this road again?'. Only you can change the path you walk in life.</p>
<p>Josie's To-Do List<br />1) Love your family. Remember the first friends you have in life are your family.<br />2) If you're ever in NY don't forget to ride the subway and definitely visit Brooklyn. I have lived here all my life and its a beautiful place.<br />3) Read. &amp; by reading I don't mean magazines. Grab a book and turn the pages.<br />4) Have a 'Me' day. Preferably a weekend day. Get a haircut, drink some wine, check into a hotel solo. Take care of yourself.<br />5) Learn to cook your favorite meal(s).<br />6) Lastly, take lots of pictures and tell the ones you love you love them as often as you can.</p>
<p>Feel free to share some insight on your country or city. I am a Tourism &amp; Hospitality major and I would like to learn about new cities around the globe. Starting with the US and beyond.</p>
<p><br />Have a very lovely day :)<br />-xx<br />Josette<br />pinkloveelace@yahoo.com<br />@ohjosie_<br />Brooklyn, NY</p>

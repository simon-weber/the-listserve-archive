      \nThen, for nearly two years we went through an even tougher journey as we tried\
      \ to conceive #2. As an educator, I was reminded of children constantly. I saw\

      \ I felt fury. Friends and acquaintances would ask innocent questions that cut\

      \ we should \u201Cprobably get on that.\u201D\r\n\r\nOuch.  Secondary infertility\
      \ was awful. When I finally broke and started saying, \u201CWe\u2019ve been\
      \ struggling with infertility\u201D one of two things usually happened. 1) The\
      \ inquirer felt immediate remorse and slinked away 2) I heard the cringe-worthy\
      \ words \u201Cwell, at least you have your son.\u201D Yep, I certainly did.\
      \ I love him to pieces. But those words made me feel guilty for wanting more.\
      \ Since it wasn\u2019t happening naturally, I felt like I was ungrateful for\
      \ wanting more.\r\n\r\nThe biggest thing I learned from our battle with infertility\
      \ is that we were NOT unique. Our story is mild in comparison to many couples\
      \ I know. There is so much heartbreak out there for the couples struggling daily\
      \ with infertility. I am now pregnant with the help of modern medicine and God,\
      \ but I still have a mindset of an infertile woman. I do not forget where I\
      \ have come from.\r\n\r\nI really wasn\u2019t sure what to write when I found\
      \ out I won, but today one of my dearest friends found out that her best hope\
      \ for conception was IVF or adoption. Infertility is always on my mind.\r\n\r\
      \nI leave you with a few suggestions. The first is to stop and think before\
      \ you speak-particularly in the case of infertility.\r\n\r\nAvoid saying:\r\n\
      \r\n1)   You can adopt/do IVF. --- Did you know this is outrageously expensive\
      \ and not always successful? Yes, adoption too.\r\n\r\n2)   Relax and it\u2019\
      ll happen when you least expect it. --- Trust me, my thickened uterine lining\
      \ and reproductive system failing to ovulate were not remedied by a good massage.\r\
      \n\r\n3)   If it\u2019s meant to be, God will make it happen. --- I fully believe\
      \ God is the reason we did conceive, but when you say this it makes us feel\
      \ like God doesn\u2019t find us worthy to conceive. Then we start thinking about\
      \ all the negligent parents out there who did\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\nTry this instead:\r\
      \n1)   Lend an ear. Listen to your friend and let them know that you are always\
      \ there for them. Give them a hug.\r\n\r\n2)   Remember them on Mother\u2019\
      s Day or Father\u2019s Day. Those holidays hurt the aching, longing hearts.\
      \ A simple text is sufficient.\r\n\r\n3)   Show that you are interested. Do\
      \ some research on infertility. Offer to attend a difficult appointment or watch\
      \ their other child/children.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last thing I will say is to \u201C\
      always be a little kinder than necessary\u201D (J.M. Barrie). It doesn\u2019\
      t have to be infertility, guys. People are struggling every single day. Each\
      \ person is fighting a battle that you may know nothing about. What I do know\
      \ is that if you were to hear each person\u2019s struggle, your response to\
      \ their actions might be different. Take a moment to inquire about someone\u2019\
      s day and offer a smile. We can all use a bit more of that in our lives.\r\n\

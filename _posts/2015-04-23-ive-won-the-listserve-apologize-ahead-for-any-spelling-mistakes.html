      \ Some places were great, others not so. When I\r\nfinally got into a homeless\

      \ kicked me out for laughing at her. I\r\ntried to stop myself but she got so\
      \ caught up in the fact that there\r\nwas a pillow thief running around. So\
      \ I went to this horrible shelter.\r\nDrug addicts, alcoholics, etc. I tried\
      \ using the restroom but because\r\nthat was the only place with no cameras,\
      \ all the addicts would snort,\r\ninject, smoke stuff and there was always a\
      \ perpetual haze in there. I\r\nwould come out all dizzy and light-headed from\
      \ the fumes.\r\n\r\nThis one time, a dude I've never seen before tried to show\
      \ me\r\nsomething in the bathroom. It glinted shiny so my immediatte though\r\
      \nwas \"knife!\" I raised my hand to block it and was about to hit him\r\nwhen\
      \ it was revealed to be just a lighter. Whew...\r\n\r\nI also apperantly took\

      \ I spent the whole night stressed and\r\nwith one eye open thinking I was going\
      \ to be shanked by the brother.\r\nLuckily, I got out of there quick as the\
      \ better shelter had a vacancy.\r\nI made sure to stay away from that Short\
      \ Queen.\r\n\r\nI had one last trial before getting out of homelessness: I fell\
      \ into a\r\nCatch-22. I had already started a nice, Monday to Friday job. Too\
      \ bad\r\nthe DMV isn't open on Saturdays so I couldn't get an ID for a pretty\r\
      \nlong time. I needed my ID to cash my check, but I need my check cashed\r\n\
      to pay for an ID. Luckily, a coworker helped me out by cashing my\r\ncheck for\
      \ me. And then I find out I need to wait 2 weeks before\r\nreceiving it in the\
      \ mail. That was convenient /s.\r\n\r\nWe played a lot of cards. Talked a lot\
      \ about random things. It\r\nactually surprised me that I could find other \"\
      normal\" people there. I\r\nguess life doesn't discriminate when it wants to\
      \ hit hard. It just\r\nsucks that mistakes people make follow them for a long\
      \ time after\r\nthey've been made. And when humans do try to get their life\
      \ turned\r\naround, it feels like every stride one takes, the government hits\
      \ you\r\nand tries to keep you from improving. Poor tax. I had to pay huge fees\r\
      \njust because I was poor which kept me poor. Even though I've never\r\nbeen\
      \ addicted to anything, I think me trying to climb out of\r\nhomelessness and\
      \ poverty was a sort of metaphor the Universe wanted me\r\nto understand for\
      \ what addicts were going through.\r\n\r\nThank you, Universe. Thanks for the\
      \ enemies, thanks for the friends.\r\nThanks for... perspective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\

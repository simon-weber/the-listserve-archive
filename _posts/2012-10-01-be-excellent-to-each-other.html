<p>"Only a life lived for others is a life worth living" (Albert Einstein)</p>
<p>   It is easy for each of us to get caught up in the minutiae of every day life. I have pursued posessions and sought answers in religion and in learned books but have returned to one simple truth - true bliss exists only in being of service to others. </p>
<p>   It is not about any particular set of morality. We are all part of a global community. Our existence is made easier by that community and we are beholden to it and to each other. John Hobbes wrote about the state of nature being "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short" and in order to avoid that we formed communities. Your life is made easier and better by your connections to each other and it is our duty and our privilege to support one another. The more we become connected and help one another, the more we all benefit. Call it selfish selflessness.  </p>
<p>   I find bliss in working with disabled individuals to help them find dignity and respect. I take this opportunity to ask each of you to take time in your lives to be of service to one another. It can be big or small. It will be easy to dismiss this email as another burden on you, but try for a moment to remember times someone has helped you. </p>
<p>Please take this to heart and find some way to be of service to someone everyday, it will change you.</p>

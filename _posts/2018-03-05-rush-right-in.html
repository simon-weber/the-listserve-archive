      <p>I don&#8217;t remember when exactly I joined the Listserve, but I do know
      that I joined because of a Listserve email my best friend Nikki had forwarded
      to me years ago. I never really gave all that much thought into what I would

      <p>So, I am asking you, dear Listserve, have any of you relocated to a different

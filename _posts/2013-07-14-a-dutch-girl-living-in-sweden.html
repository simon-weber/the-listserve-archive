    <p>First of all; thanks for all those wonderful e-mails I received from you who
    already won the Listserve-lottery!</p>

    <p>And now, this is my story.</p>

    <p>My name is Britt. When I was fourteen, my parents told me they wanted to emigrate,
    together with me, my little brother and sister.<br />A year later, we moved from
    Holland to Sweden.<br />It was such a big step, but after a few years living in
    this wonderful country, we have learned the language, have contact with a lot
    of lovely Swedes, feel happy in our house and are going to school and have jobs.</p>

    <p>My mum, my dad, my brother, sister and me, we did change. In a positive way,
    I would say. We are more comfortable with unknown situations and like to get to
    know new people. I am absolutely sure that if we never had left Holland, I still
    would be that shy girl who I was before.</p>

    <p>So, with this story, what I want to say to you is JUST DO IT. And yes, that''s
    the slogan of a big sportbrand, but also a very good quote to keep in mind when
    you want to change your life. Or just little things in life (you have to start
    somewhere...).<br />It is better to regret something you did (and have the experience
    of doing it) than regretting something you never did. You only get one chance!</p>

    <p>The last thing I want to share with you are some very good artists, who need
    some more attention and appreciation. Listen and enjoy!</p>

    <p>Triggerfinger (rock from Belgium)<br />Anouk (best singer from Holland and
    she participated in the Eurovision Song Contest for Holland. according to me,
    her best album is Urban Solitude)<br />Beth Hart (she is the best and needs more
    fans!)<br />Hugh Laurie (dr. House and yes, he can sing)</p>

    <p>Please share your story with me. At what points did you think JUST DO IT? And
    are you happy you did?<br />Please visit my blog by typing "brittalicious" on

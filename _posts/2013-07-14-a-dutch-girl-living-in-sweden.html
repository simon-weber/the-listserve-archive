<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>First of all; thanks for all those wonderful e-mails I received from you who already won the Listserve-lottery!</p>
<p>And now, this is my story.</p>
<p>My name is Britt. When I was fourteen, my parents told me they wanted to emigrate, together with me, my little brother and sister.<br />A year later, we moved from Holland to Sweden.<br />It was such a big step, but after a few years living in this wonderful country, we have learned the language, have contact with a lot of lovely Swedes, feel happy in our house and are going to school and have jobs.</p>
<p>My mum, my dad, my brother, sister and me, we did change. In a positive way, I would say. We are more comfortable with unknown situations and like to get to know new people. I am absolutely sure that if we never had left Holland, I still would be that shy girl who I was before.</p>
<p>So, with this story, what I want to say to you is JUST DO IT. And yes, that's the slogan of a big sportbrand, but also a very good quote to keep in mind when you want to change your life. Or just little things in life (you have to start somewhere...).<br />It is better to regret something you did (and have the experience of doing it) than regretting something you never did. You only get one chance!</p>
<p>The last thing I want to share with you are some very good artists, who need some more attention and appreciation. Listen and enjoy!</p>
<p>Triggerfinger (rock from Belgium)<br />Anouk (best singer from Holland and she participated in the Eurovision Song Contest for Holland. according to me, her best album is Urban Solitude)<br />Beth Hart (she is the best and needs more fans!)<br />Hugh Laurie (dr. House and yes, he can sing)</p>
<p>Please share your story with me. At what points did you think JUST DO IT? And are you happy you did?<br />Please visit my blog by typing "brittalicious" on a search engine.</p>
<p>Thanks so much for reading! / Tack f&#246;r att du l&#228;ste detta! / Bedankt voor het lezen!</p>
<p><br />All the best,<br />Britt.<br />brittlistserve@hotmail.com<br />somewhere between Holland and Sweden</p>

<p>These five songs have shaped me as an individual, they have shaped the way I look at the world around me, and they have shaped my vision of the future I&#8217;d like to live.</p>
<p>S&#233;bastien Tellier // La Ritournelle &#8211; I think I was already in love when I first heard this song, but in this song I disappeared deep into our life together. It&#8217;s possible this is the world&#8217;s most perfect song.</p>
<p>Brother Ali // Rain Water &#8211; I first saw Ali perform almost 10 years ago in a dive bar above a movie theater in St. Louis. Last week he sold out the Bowery Ballroom in New York. I hold close his music and life story as a reminder that greatness takes years to achieve.</p>
<p>Air // Run &#8211; To my dearest sister Emma. Your artwork is a gift to us all. I have come to accept that there are complexities and emotions behind it I may never understand &#8211; but this no longer gets in the way of me enjoying it.</p>
<p>Jay-Z // Beach Chair &#8211; &#8220;I said from not being afraid to fall out the sky.&#8221; Disrupting my comfort zone has never failed me as a means for achieving my desired path. Ad astra per aspera.</p>
<p>Dan Deacon // USA IV: Manifest &#8211; I am America. Through doubt, angst and struggle I push on, because at my core there is a tireless optimist driven by good values and the highest of aspirations.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>

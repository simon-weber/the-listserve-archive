    \ loves a fire truck, and the station was covered in photographs from before my\

    \ seemed to fit my personality.  It seemed like it would be something different\
    \ to do with my days.\r\n\r\nI passed fire school, got a few years of experience\
    \ under my belt, and decided that I wanted to do this for a living.  2 years and\
    \ 3 applications later, I was accepted into the Baltimore City Fire Department\
    \ in 2008.  I began the fire academy.\r\n\r\nMore push-ups and yelling than I\
    \ could have ever expected, but I learned all of the quirks that my local county\
    \ training had never taught me. Baltimore was much different than little old York\
    \ ever was.  I learned about checking your hydrants for drugs or guns before hooking\
    \ up and charging supply lines. I learned never to stand directly in front of\
    \ a door after knocking on it, in case somebody decided to shoot first and ask\
    \ questions later.  I learned how to survive in a big city.\r\n\r\nMany of our\
    \ citizens are below the poverty level, and are uninsured or severely underinsured.\
    \  Working in Baltimore City means that I became an emergency medical technician\
    \ in the academy (it\u2019s a requirement). I spend my days cleaning up things\
    \ that have shown me the worst parts of humanity.  It\u2019s quite easy to become\
    \ jaded.  Anyone who has ever been to Baltimore knows that it\u2019s rough down\
    \ here.  We don\u2019t have the arson problem to the extent that Detroit does,\
    \ but we have no shortage of violence.  I think we could easily compete with Chicago\
    \ any day.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that we ask of our citizens is to remember us\
    \ come budget time.  We don\u2019t need much, just fire engines that pump water\
    \ and medics that don\u2019t break down in the middle of a run.  Right now, I\
    \ personally have seen patients wait upwards of 1+ hour for an ambulance and I\u2019\
    ve seen engines that wouldn\u2019t pump water at a fire.  Sometimes, it seems\
    \ like we\u2019re always on the chopping block, and it sucks knowing that someone\
    \ is dead or a house collapsed because of equipment failure.  I think that without\
    \ good paramedics and functioning ambulances, our death by homicide rate would\
    \ be much higher.\r\n\r\nJust a few things you can do:\r\n\r\n\xB7         Remember\
    \ the ones who lose their lives doing this job.  343 in New York City, 9 in Charleston,\
    \ 10 in West Texas, 19 in Arizona, and the ones here and there that are all gone\
    \ because of their bravery.\r\n\r\n\xB7         Visit your local firehouse.  The\
    \ history there will amaze you, the people will humor you, and it makes a great\
    \ trip for those of you with children.\r\n\r\n\xB7         Slow down!  If it isn\u2019\
    t fire or heart attacks that kill us, it\u2019s people driving too fast down a\
    \ highway even after they see the big red truck with the flashing lights.\r\n\r\
    \n\xB7         If you ever go the 9/11 memorial, make sure to visit Engine/Truck\
    \ 10 right across the street.  Their website tells an incredible story of that\
    \ morning, and the plaque on the side of the firehouse is incredible and moving.\r\

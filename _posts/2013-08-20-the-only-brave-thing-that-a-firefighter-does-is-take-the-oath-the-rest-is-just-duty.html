<p>I became a volunteer firefighter in 2005 in York, Pennsylvania.  I don&#8217;t know why I joined, it just seemed like something to do at the time.  Everybody loves a fire truck, and the station was covered in photographs from before my grandparents were even born.  The people had a dry, morbid sense of humor, which seemed to fit my personality.  It seemed like it would be something different to do with my days.</p>
<p>I passed fire school, got a few years of experience under my belt, and decided that I wanted to do this for a living.  2 years and 3 applications later, I was accepted into the Baltimore City Fire Department in 2008.  I began the fire academy.</p>
<p>More push-ups and yelling than I could have ever expected, but I learned all of the quirks that my local county training had never taught me. Baltimore was much different than little old York ever was.  I learned about checking your hydrants for drugs or guns before hooking up and charging supply lines. I learned never to stand directly in front of a door after knocking on it, in case somebody decided to shoot first and ask questions later.  I learned how to survive in a big city.</p>
<p>Many of our citizens are below the poverty level, and are uninsured or severely underinsured.  Working in Baltimore City means that I became an emergency medical technician in the academy (it&#8217;s a requirement). I spend my days cleaning up things that have shown me the worst parts of humanity.  It&#8217;s quite easy to become jaded.  Anyone who has ever been to Baltimore knows that it&#8217;s rough down here.  We don&#8217;t have the arson problem to the extent that Detroit does, but we have no shortage of violence.  I think we could easily compete with Chicago any day.</p>
<p>The only thing that we ask of our citizens is to remember us come budget time.  We don&#8217;t need much, just fire engines that pump water and medics that don&#8217;t break down in the middle of a run.  Right now, I personally have seen patients wait upwards of 1+ hour for an ambulance and I&#8217;ve seen engines that wouldn&#8217;t pump water at a fire.  Sometimes, it seems like we&#8217;re always on the chopping block, and it sucks knowing that someone is dead or a house collapsed because of equipment failure.  I think that without good paramedics and functioning ambulances, our death by homicide rate would be much higher.</p>
<p>Just a few things you can do:</p>
<p>&#183;         Remember the ones who lose their lives doing this job.  343 in New York City, 9 in Charleston, 10 in West Texas, 19 in Arizona, and the ones here and there that are all gone because of their bravery.</p>
<p>&#183;         Visit your local firehouse.  The history there will amaze you, the people will humor you, and it makes a great trip for those of you with children.</p>
<p>&#183;         Slow down!  If it isn&#8217;t fire or heart attacks that kill us, it&#8217;s people driving too fast down a highway even after they see the big red truck with the flashing lights.</p>
<p>&#183;         If you ever go the 9/11 memorial, make sure to visit Engine/Truck 10 right across the street.  Their website tells an incredible story of that morning, and the plaque on the side of the firehouse is incredible and moving.</p>
<p>Join.  Many small towns are protected solely by volunteers, and the fire service has a pension for pulling all types of people.</p>

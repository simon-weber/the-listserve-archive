      <p>I''m obsessed with being productive. I turned 30 last year, and suddenly
      realised that after 10 or more years of unfocused meandering, time is my most
      valuable resource, and I need to make my days count if I want to feel good about
      my life in 40 years time. Taking my productivity seriously has changed my life
      like crazy, to the extent that I''m now trying to launch a small productivity
      product. Amazingly, I won the Listserve the same week that I''m announcing this,
      my first product, and that''s why I''ve chosen to write about this rather than
      any of the other myriad things I could just as easily decide to write about.</p>

      <p>I know there are plenty of other productivity freaks out there, so here,
      for their benefit, is a short list things that you simply must check out if
      you''re into productivity:</p>

      <p>David Allen - Getting Things Done. This book is nothing short of amazing.<br
      />Things - a suite of Mac and iPhone/iPad apps by Cultured Code. They make being
      organised much easier, and a lot more fun!<br />SubZero.email - my new tool
      for making inbox zero an easy thing to reach and keep. Apologies for the self
      promotion, it was never my intent when I signed up to the Listserve, but the
      timing was too fortunate to ignore.</p>

      <p>Apologies to everyone else for what might be the most boring email you''ve
      received in a while.</p>

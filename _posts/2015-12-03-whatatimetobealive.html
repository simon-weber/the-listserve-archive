      \ better, more thoughtfully, more intuitively, in ways we often can\u2019t intellectually\

      \ jealousy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment,\
      \ inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego.\r\n\r\nThe other is\
      \ good. It is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence,\
      \ empathy, generosity, truth, compassion and faith.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe grandson\
      \ thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather: \u2018Which\

      <p>&#8220;The problem, often not discovered until late in life, is that when
      you look for things in life like love, meaning, motivation, it implies they
      are sitting behind a tree or under a rock. The most successful people in life
      recognize, that in life they create their own love, they manufacture their own

      <p>For me, I am driven by two main philosophies, know more today about the world
      than I knew yesterday. And lessen the suffering of others. You''d be surprised
      how far that gets you.&#8221;</p>

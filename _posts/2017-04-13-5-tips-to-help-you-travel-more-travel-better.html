      \ pink hair, I put bow ties on my cat, and I believe in laughing every day.\
      \ I've volunteered to repair trails at the Grand Canyon, snorkeled in zero degree\
      \ water in Iceland, and rode an art car with Susan Sarandon at Burning Man.\
      \ I will always say yes to dessert, cat videos, and sleeping in late.\r\n\r\n\
      Here are my 5 tips that can help you travel more (and better):\r\n\r\n1. Check\
      \ theflightdeal dot com and secretflying dot com every day\r\nMoney is a big\
      \ reason that people don\u2019t travel as much as they\u2019d like, but you\
      \ can snag insane (and totally legit) flights on here. I certainly have\u2014\
      $375 roundtrip to Brazil? $400 roundtrip to Italy? Yes, please.\r\n\r\n2. Go\
      \ by the rule of 3\u2019s\r\nThat is, at least 3 days in any given location,\
      \ and no more than 3 planned activities per day. This allows you enough time\
      \ to become familiar with a place and gives you the chance for exploration.\r\
      \n\r\n3. Connect with others online\r\nToday, you can easily hop on the interwebz\
      \ and connect with people all around the world to get their advice as you plan\
      \ a trip and as you travel. Instagram, Twitter, Facebook groups, Meetup, and\
      \ Couchsurfing are wonderful for this.\r\n\r\n4. Learn the language\r\nEven\
      \ if it\u2019s just a little bit: \u201CHello,\u201D \u201CPlease,\u201D \u201C\
      Thank you,\u201D \u201CExcuse me.\u201D You\u2019ll feel like an idiot, but\
      \ locals appreciate it. And even if you\u2019re not traveling anywhere foreign\
      \ soon, learning a language still feels incredibly rewarding. Duolingo is a\
      \ free app for this, although I\u2019ve had the most success with Pimsleur\u2019\
      s Language Programs (you can probably rent the CDs from the library, like I\
      \ did, or find them on Audible).\r\n\r\n5. Remember that people are good.\r\n\
      Not all, unfortunately, but most are. Of course, go with your gut and be smart\
      \ about it\u2014but don\u2019t be afraid to trust and forge beautiful human\
      \ connections.\r\n\r\nI talk travel on my blog Tremendous Times. I go cool places\
      \ sometimes (currently packing for Mexico), but I\u2019m especially passionate\
      \ about helping people balance their wanderlust with the other things they love,\
      \ like work, friends, and family. If this sounds like your jam, let\u2019s connect:\
      \ tremendoustimes dot com and @tremendoustimes.\r\n\r\nOh, and have you been\
      \ to Italy? I ask because I\u2019m going there for the first time on my honeymoon\
      \ this August and am putting my tip #3 above into good use. If you have traveled\
      \ there/lived there/live there currently, I\u2019d love to hear your stories\
      \ and recommendations. Message me: hello@tremendoustimes.com.\r\n\r\nSafe travels,\r\

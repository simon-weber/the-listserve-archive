      \ the kind of person that observes and catches a moment and let word take over\
      \ the rest. This is probably because of my need of knowledge as well as not\
      \ wanting to feel alone, and I think it\u2019s due to the fact that when someone\
      \ reads a something mine, they take a little part of me with them, so, if tomorrow\
      \ I would die, that little part would live on.\r\n\r\nI have just begun a new\
      \ stage in my life, moving from the city of Aguascalientes to Mexico City, the\
      \ capital of the country, first, to finish my thesis in cinematography studies\
      \ (Yes, I am a cinephiliac), and second, to discover more stories. I mean, Mexico\

      \ which I love.\r\n\r\nAs many people, I have an emotional shortage, and still\
      \ am in love with a person that lives in the city of Zacatecas, far away from\
      \ here. It\u2019s a story like many others, that begun with a \u201CHi\u201D\
      , and from there, a train of feelings delivered by words. She is living in that\
      \ part of life when you have to live your life, do your stuff and be yourself,\
      \ and I am living in the part when you feel lost. And so I moved. But as Gabriel\
      \ Garcia Marquez once wrote, \u201CDistance is not a problem, the problem is\
      \ humans, because we don\u2019t know to love without touching, seeing or listening.\
      \ And love is felt with the heart, not the body\u201D, I feel her and I like\
      \ to think that her feels me as well, even with hundreds of miles between us.\r\
      \n\r\nI truly believe that what happens to us is not merely a random coincidence,\
      \ but is always for a purpose, like having the chance to be read by you at the\
      \ beginning of this new part of my life, as well as been able to help someone\
      \ living in Mexico City, because \u201CWhen you got nothing, you got nothing\
      \ to lose\u201D, and since I consider myself a traveler that is just passing\
      \ by and as long as I keep traveling, it will be a pleasure to help you, even\

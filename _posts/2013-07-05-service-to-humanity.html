  body: "I'll start off with my story and then we'll get into why it matters. I love\
    \ basketball, but we'll come back to that. Went to college hoping to become a\
    \ doctor, didn't quite work out. Didn't feel so great about myself for letting\
    \ my parents down. Met some great people. Some not so great. Both groups were\
    \ equally important to me. Met this girl, but that ended up like my med school\
    \ dreams, just slowly drifted away. Missed my little brother a ton, made sure\
    \ to keep checking up on him. I've always raised him like a son, and he's always\
    \ seen me as a cool older brother - so it works out for both of us. Decided I'll\
    \ be joining the Navy Hospital Corps in a year, I'm pretty damn excited about\
    \ that. I think that sums it up pretty well.\r\n\r\nSo basketball... it's always\
    \ been my sanctuary. I've been playing since age 4. I love everything about the\
    \ sport. I can watch it anywhere, anytime, no matter who's playing. Right now\
    \ I'm coaching a group of middle school  children(~age 12-15) and it's one of\
    \ the best experiences of my life. They grew up in a tough neighborhood in New\
    \ York City, so this is a good influence for them. I see myself in them sometimes,\
    \ because I know they're escaping something to come play this beautiful game.\r\
    \n\r\nIf there's anything I learned from all these different emotions it's that\
    \ there is not a better feeling in the world than to make others truly happy.\
    \ To me, it's selfish for me to be upset about not going to med school, or not\
    \ getting the girl, because I am incredibly blessed and lucky to be where I am\
    \ today. Whether it's when I'm at the nursing home playing bingo with the residents,\
    \ or refereeing a Special Olympics Soccer Qualifier - putting a smile on another\
    \ human's face is the best feeling in the world.\r\n\r\nSo here's what I want\
    \ to do, if you're still with me up to this point. I want to go to India and start\
    \ a foundation that gives the opportunity and resources to underprivileged children\
    \ in order for them to become basketball players. This doesn't necessarily mean\
    \ pros in the NBA, but just turning them into happy, HEALTHY athletes is enough\
    \ for me. I don't care how much money they have, because I won't take a penny\
    \ from them. I don't care how little they know about basketball, because that's\
    \ what the coaches will be there for. I want to help them achieve their goals\
    \ through basketball, even if becoming a professional basketball player isn't\
    \ the final goal. Think of it as a launching pad for their dreams - of sorts.\
    \ I'll be waiting for a reply from you with your advice or how you can help me\
    \ out. I am a single person with a big dream and I need your help to put a smile\
    \ on these kids' faces. Let's make it happen. Please.\r\n\r\n\r\nJessey\t\r\n\

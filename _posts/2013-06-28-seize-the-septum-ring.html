    body: "First of all, to all of you past Listserve writers, thank you for sharing.\
      \  I\u2019ve read each one from top to bottom.  Whether strictly informational\
      \ or a vent of something that\u2019s been bottled up too long or something else\
      \ entirely, each Listserve email is, in itself, an insight into how various\
      \ people choose to use a loudspeaker moment.  I didn\u2019t join in the hopes\
      \ of having that moment; I joined to see what others would do with theirs. \
      \ Yet now I\u2019ve been caught in the spotlight, and who am I to chicken out?\r\
      \n\r\nMany Listservers have shared their own rules, mottos, inspirational messages,\
      \ etc. on how to get going with life: Carpe Diem, one foot in front of the other,\
      \ don\u2019t fear failure, put yourself out there, learn something new, etc.\
      \  I don\u2019t want to pooh-pooh any of that, but much of it is easier said\
      \ than done.  Fear of failure can be pretty darned ingrained in people.  And\
      \ how does one seize a day?  Does it have horns or a septum ring one can latch\
      \ on to?\r\n\r\nMotivational speeches, slogans, and pep talks are great if they\
      \ happen to apply to you and your unique situation at that particular point\
      \ in your life.  They can get us jacked up and excited, which is usually good.\
      \  But without anything tangible to put that jacked-up excitement into, the\
      \ Jack who\u2019s popped from the box goes limp and the music stops.  (Yes,\
      \ I know there\u2019s a that\u2019s-what-she-said joke in there somewhere.)\r\
      \n\r\nSo what should come next?  Well, I hate to present a problem without a\
      \ possible solution, so I\u2019ll share what I think.  First, slow down, hot\
      \ shot.  Don\u2019t go sprinting off whatever couch you\u2019ve been sitting\
      \ on and seize the first septum ring you see, thinking it\u2019s attached to\
      \ a diem.  What you\u2019re looking to do is apprentice from someone else who\
      \ is more advanced than you.  I\u2019m not talking about any Donald Trump crap;\
      \ think Ben Franklin.  This works for virtually everything and can give you\
      \ tangible tasks toward reasonable goals.  To be a good apprentice, you need\
      \ three things: someone who is a good teacher of beginner-level and novice work,\
      \ a master-level practitioner whose techniques you can dissect and model, and\
      \ someone who will watch you closely and keep you accountable.  If you\u2019\
      re lucky, you\u2019ll find all three in one person.  If not, make due; you\u2019\
      ll be fine.\r\n\r\nBut it does mean asking for help, which is often the hardest\
      \ part.\r\n\r\nWant to be a writer?  Read your favorite author over and over\
      \ and over, dissecting what he or she is doing, take some classes, and join/create\
      \ a writer\u2019s group.  Want to be happier?  Search out someone truly, consistently\
      \ happy (not just delusional), and tell someone who cares about you that you\u2019\
      re not happy.  They\u2019ll help.  Get the idea?  I want to be a great father\
      \ for my kids, but, as much as I love my own, I apprentice from my childless\
      \ uncle who actually got down on the floor and played silly games with us when\
      \ we were kids.\r\n\r\nAnd, for the love of whatever God/gods you believe in,\
      \ if you ever see someone struggling, help.  Whether it\u2019s a hug or teaching\
      \ the ways of the printing press, the human race advances only through the sharing\
      \ of kindness and experience.\r\n\r\nBut before I reach my word limit, watch\
      \ Bill Murray\u2019s \u201CRazor\u2019s Edge.\u201D  Listen to Buckethead\u2019\
      s \u201CMonsters and Robots\u201D and R.L. Burnside\u2019s \u201CA Ass Pocket\
      \ of Whiskey.\u201D\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s it for me. Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\nMatt\t\r\

    body: "I met an old lady at a bar in Denver in 2005 who told me, \u201CYou only\
      \ get five regrets in life. If you come across a sixth regret, you have to let\
      \ go of one of the other five.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis old lady was as confident in\
      \ this \u201C5 Regret Rule\u201D as she was drunk, so I\u2019m assuming she\u2019\
      s operating on some kind of insider information and this rule is a real thing\
      \ we all must follow. As I\u2019ve gotten older, my list of regrets has morphed\
      \ from things that were very specific (\u201CI should have asked that girl out\
      \ freshman year\u201D or \u201CI shouldn\u2019t have gotten arrested those three\
      \ times\u201D) to a list of bigger picture regrets. Perhaps this is a sign that\
      \ I\u2019m growing up.\r\n\r\nSo, here is the list of five regrets as it currently\
      \ stands for this nearly-grown-up 38 year-old Minnesotan with a positive attitude\
      \ and a love of whiskey.\r\n\r\n1.\tI wasn\u2019t very nice in high school.\r\
      \nI wasn\u2019t a bully or anything, but I was really concerned with being popular.\
      \ This meant I was really only nice to the people that were \u201Ccool.\u201D\
      \ Ugh, this one is embarrassing for me think about.\r\n\r\n2.\tI did very little\
      \ work/studying in college.\r\nSince then, Carol Dweck\u2019s book \u201CMindset\u201D\
      \ has explained to me that I had a fixed mindset through college (and several\
      \ years afterwards as well). This meant I would rather put in zero effort and\
      \ get a 3.0 GPA than try really hard and risk not getting a 4.0 (and risk showing\
      \ everyone that I wasn\u2019t as smart as I wanted them to think I was).\r\n\
      \r\n3.\tI never learned to sing and/or play an instrument. When I was in the\
      \ fourth grade my music teacher told me I was a terrible singer. Sure, that\
      \ was a crappy thing to do to a ten year-old, but I still shouldn\u2019t have\
      \ let it keep me from working hard at learning to be a marginal musician (another\
      \ example of my fixed mindset). I really love listening to music, think how\
      \ it would make me feel if I could make it. I guess the good news is that there\u2019\
      s still time to remedy this regret.\r\n\r\n4.\tI accomplished very little in\
      \ my late 20s/early 30s. I had a job that paid enough to live comfortably while\
      \ requiring less than 10 hours of work a week. That means I had 40,000 free-time\
      \ hours to accomplish something and yet, I have very little to show for it.\
      \ I could\u2019ve at least volunteered at a homeless shelter or attempted the\
      \ next great American novel. I\u2019m not even sure what I did instead. Video\
      \ games, maybe?\r\n\r\n5.\tI don\u2019t enjoy being a dad as much as I want\
      \ to. My kids are 4 and 2, and so far, it\u2019s been like 97% logistics and\
      \ 3% awesomeness. The tide is shifting every day (yesterday was like 70/30),\
      \ so there\u2019s hope for the future, but really, I wish I was one of those\
      \ people who got real joy out of the little things their kids do (\u201Cshe\
      \ ate solid food for the first time!!!\u201D).\r\n\r\nI\u2019d love to read\
      \ your list of five regrets if you email them to me. Unless of course you put,\
      \ \u201Creading this boring list serve email\u201D as one of your regrets.\r\
      \n\r\nThanks for listening. Am excited to hear what you regret!\r\n\r\n\r\n\

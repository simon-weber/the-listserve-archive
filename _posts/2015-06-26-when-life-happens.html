    body: "Something I\u2019ve learned in my young life is that things change. Period.\
      \ You can\u2019t predict them happening and some will have a bigger effect than\
      \ others, but it\u2019s how you respond to these changes that makes you who\
      \ you are, and ultimately decides the path your life takes. \L\L\r\n\r\nTherefore,\
      \ I am going to tell you, 23,740 of my newest friends, something that only a\
      \ few of my closest friends and family know. I am moving to London from New\
      \ York City! I have never been to London and barely know anything about it.\r\
      \n\r\n\L\LHow\u2019s that for a life change?\r\n\r\n\L\LIn the past month, my\
      \ girlfriend and I broke up, and my company started looking for someone similar\
      \ to me in our UK office. I raised my hand, and they bought my pitch. It\u2019\
      s funny how the timing of things works out sometimes.\L\L\r\n\r\nThe breakup\
      \ devastated me, things weren\u2019t always great but it still came as a shock,\
      \ and having the most meaningful relationship I\u2019ve had end, was hard to\
      \ swallow. We both got too comfortable and settled in, rarely taking time to\
      \ appreciate each other.\r\n\r\n\L\LI wish someone kept reminding me these few\
      \ things along the way: do the small things and be selfless when tending to\
      \ your partner \u2013 it\u2019s chivalrous and essential. Travel, have adventures,\
      \ and keep things interesting, it goes much further than you\u2019d expect.\
      \ \_Lastly, don\u2019t just live your life with an end-goal in mind, enjoy the\
      \ steps along the way.\r\n\r\n\L\LBut, we march on.\r\n\r\n\L\LI am a man of\
      \ many interests, and a few passions. I work in Corporate Finance, and I love\
      \ my job. My ultimate goal is to start and run a company, and my job allows\
      \ me to get the inside scoop on what makes a business successful. Something\
      \ that will serve me well later in life. \L\L\r\n\r\nWhile I enjoy what I do,\
      \ it doesn\u2019t fully define who I am. I coach a 12U travel baseball team\
      \ in Manhattan (yes, even the Concrete Jungle has some green patches). I played\
      \ baseball all the way through college, but coaching has taken my love for the\
      \ game to a new level. I plead with you to find something you\u2019re passionate\
      \ about in life and act on it.\r\n\r\n\L\LMoving to London is the biggest risk\
      \ I\u2019ve taken, and I couldn\u2019t be more excited. I\u2019ve only been\
      \ to Europe once (to Ireland) and don\u2019t know what I am getting myself into,\
      \ but I\u2019m ready for the adventure. \L\L\r\n\r\nLastly, the biggest realization\
      \ I\u2019ve had in my 26+ years is: To be happy, you must be completely honest\
      \ with yourself first. As an optimist, it\u2019s one of the hardest things for\
      \ me to do, always seeing things as better than they actually are. But I\u2019\
      m working at it, and am ultimately in a better place. Before I leave for work\
      \ each day, I think about what\u2019s truly important to me, keeping those thoughts\
      \ in mind throughout the day. Take care of yourself first, and everything else\
      \ will fall into place.\r\n\r\n\L\LAs John Lennon reminds us, \u201CEverything\
      \ will be okay in the end. If it\u2019s not okay, it\u2019s not the end.\u201D\
      \L\L\r\n\r\nI am writing this on Father\u2019s Day, which reminds me of two\

      Period. You can&#8217;t predict them happening and some will have a bigger effect
      than others, but it&#8217;s how you respond to these changes that makes you
      who you are, and ultimately decides the path your life takes. &#8232;&#8232;</p>

      <p>Therefore, I am going to tell you, 23,740 of my newest friends, something
      that only a few of my closest friends and family know. I am moving to London
      from New York City! I have never been to London and barely know anything about
      it.</p>

      <p>&#8232;&#8232;How&#8217;s that for a life change?</p>

      <p>&#8232;&#8232;In the past month, my girlfriend and I broke up, and my company
      started looking for someone similar to me in our UK office. I raised my hand,
      and they bought my pitch. It&#8217;s funny how the timing of things works out
      sometimes.&#8232;&#8232;</p>

      <p>The breakup devastated me, things weren&#8217;t always great but it still
      came as a shock, and having the most meaningful relationship I&#8217;ve had
      end, was hard to swallow. We both got too comfortable and settled in, rarely
      taking time to appreciate each other.</p>

      <p>&#8232;&#8232;I wish someone kept reminding me these few things along the
      way: do the small things and be selfless when tending to your partner &#8211;
      it&#8217;s chivalrous and essential. Travel, have adventures, and keep things
      interesting, it goes much further than you&#8217;d expect. &#160;Lastly, don&#8217;t
      just live your life with an end-goal in mind, enjoy the steps along the way.</p>

      <p>&#8232;&#8232;But, we march on.</p>

      <p>&#8232;&#8232;I am a man of many interests, and a few passions. I work in
      Corporate Finance, and I love my job. My ultimate goal is to start and run a

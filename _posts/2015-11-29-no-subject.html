      \ shouting and running through a train station because we may miss the train\
      \ that leaves in half an hour or even worse someone could be sitting in our\
      \ assigned seats. Safe to say he does not deal well under pressure and I saw\
      \ that even more recently when he was trying to write my brother\u2019s wedding\

      \ film gladiator.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve actually bothered to read this far you\u2019\

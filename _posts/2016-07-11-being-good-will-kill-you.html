      \ to the road in a very tricky corner. He decided to stop to ask if everything\
      \ is ok. He pulled over and opened the door to step outside. The moment he steps\
      \ out, a car going from the opposite direction skids and crashes right into\
      \ him. He spends the next 4 months lying unconscious in the hospital, my mum\
      \ visiting him regularly, before he passes away. I still can't even imagine\
      \ what she must have gone through. I was too young to realise, and I cannot\

      \ to wonder how many people die each year thanks to the consequences of doing\
      \ good deeds, or live their whole lives dedicated to other people that may often\
      \ not even realise it. The poor souls that put happiness of others above their\
      \ life. We can just ask and wonder why on earth these people can't just be selfish\
      \ and live their own lives happily. Had my dad been more selfish, he could've\

      \ help others when we can happily live our own lives? Why should we care about\
      \ strangers at all? I, personally, know why. Because someone so close to me\
      \ lost his life trying to help others. Becoming selfish just out of spite would\
      \ make my father's death become meaningless. Therefore, every time I do my small\
      \ bit of good and help a stranger with their suitcase, or stroller, I think\
      \ of my dad. I know these are menial little things, but I do hope they still\
      \ count. And I hope that one day I'll even have enough courage to pull over\
      \ and help a stranger stranded on the side of the road. Until then, shall I\
      \ help you carry that suitcase up the stairs?\r\n\r\n How about you? What makes\

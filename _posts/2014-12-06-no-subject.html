      \ However, at times it would get extreme. This one time, my mother decided that\
      \ she can't take life with my Dad anymore and she simply wanted to die. She\
      \ said that she would do this by starving herself as any other means would be\
      \ sinful. I remember begging her to eat after watching her starve for a day\
      \ or two. I didn't get why in the world she would do something like that back\
      \ then. I understand now though. She didn't want to die, she loved us too much.\
      \ She loved me even more. She really needed her husband to care. She was getting\
      \ sick and frail. The new business they had opened was consuming her health\
      \ and she was turning into skin and bone working day and night. Her already\
      \ fragile health was deteriorating right in front of our eyes. My Dad was a\
      \ workaholic, very well respected medical professional in the community, but\
      \ did not have it in him to understand my mother's pain. Most nights he'd stay\
      \ out at night drinking and smoking and numerous times my mom has had to go\
      \ out looking for him in the bars/streets. She's my hero for pulling through\
      \ all of that and for having successfully ingrained the importance of family\
      \ in my Dad's head. She is so strong. I wonder sometimes if I should have spoken\
      \ up and told her to leave him, but times were different back then and I was\
      \ in denial about any of what was happening. I started thinking about what happened\
      \ during my childhood a lot more recently. I needed to dig deeper to explain\
      \ to myself why I was not like my friends. I was never insecure about anything\
      \ growing up. I looked good enough for me, I did great in school and I had no\
      \ trouble making friends. I wasn't caring at all though, especially to people\
      \ who were not immediately related to me or very close to me. Showing care felt\
      \ like undressing a burn where the gauze would stay stuck to the wound while\
      \ you try to remove it. It was very painful, It felt physically impossible to\
      \ do, I couldn't even fake it. It's not like that anymore though. After several\
      \ toxic relationships where the men were never really with me or cared really\
      \ all that much about me, which made me crazy mad of course and led to fights\
      \ which felt like home, I  finally figured it out. Once I made the connection,\
      \ I was reborn. I cared, in fact I cared enormously. I cared about everyone.\
      \ It didn't matter whether I knew them or not. I cared about them and I cared\
      \ about their story. It's a much better world to live in when we care about\
      \ eachother:)\r\n\r\nThis process led to so many good things in my life. One\
      \ of which was finding the man of my dreams. I can't imagine life without him.\

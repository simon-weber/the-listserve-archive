      <p>Against all odds I was chosen to write to The Listserve, but my 48 hour period
      expired. Although I usually read all Listserve emails on the day I get them,
      this one I didn''t open on time to respond to it (48h).</p>

      <p>This may be a lesson worth to be shared. It''s a metaphor of what life is
      all about: taking the chances, grabbing the opportunities. Because they will
      arise and if we are not ready to take them it may almost be like they never
      even existed to us.</p>

      <p>But in my life I have learnt that there is always a second chance. If this
      message is reaching you it is the proof that it is true.</p>

      <p>So, if you are reading this...</p>

      <p>1) Be ready to take the opportunities in your life.<br />2) If you think
      you just missed one, try to pursue it anyways, cause it may not be completely
      lost.<br />3) Learn from your mistakes so you don''t miss another one, and be
      ready for the next.</p>

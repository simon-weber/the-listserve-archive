    Volunteering culture was all over the news this summer with Olympic Gamesmakers\

    \ sensitivity and compassion warmed my heart. In both sending cards myself and\
    \ encouraging others to send one themselves I felt some of the joy that Fromm\

    \ What do you give to your world around you?\r\n\r\nHave a good day\r\n\r\n\r\n\

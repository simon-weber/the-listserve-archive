<p class="meta">February 05 2013</p>

<p>Upon selection I began to research what I wanted to say. I stumbled across the initial article that alerted me to the existence of The Listserve. This reminder of the lucky circumstance in which I discovered Listserve reminded me of the joy of sharing something of interest with those around me.</p>
<p>I reread my favourite entries; including the first one I received by Tim Krins. His article was a letter thanking his teachers who shared their passions for life. As a teacher I felt it rather fortuitous to receive this as my first post, especially as it arrived at the end of a busy day. It was something that encouraged me to continue to read.</p>
<p>I watched the websites video and completed the sentences. It helped me think of some ideas<br />-    Sometimes I wonder&#8230; how far we make our own luck. Can life be understood as a serious of lucky circumstances, or do the lucky circumstances come to those who look for them<br />-    I noticed recently that&#8230; starting the day with a positive thought gives a different outlook for the day. I always found the idea of gratitude journaling a little bit cheesy, but recently I downloaded an app onto my phone and it has been an interesting experiment so far.<br />-    I just wish I could&#8230; find it easy to focus on one thing. I&#8217;m easily distracted by lots of different topics. A sense of curiosity about the world is undoubtedly a good thing but at times I do need to remember to rein it in</p>
<p>I asked people the question &#8220;If you had the chance to speak to a 25000 people, what would you say?&#8221; Their responses fascinated me. It started some unexpected and captivating conversations. Unusual questions or &#8220;thunks&#8221; can lead to unexpectedly insightful conversations.</p>
<p>Suggestions I received included<br />1. 'Warts and all' account of your life in the style of Studs Turkel<br />2. Altruism<br />3. The many flaws of the coalition governments&#8217; policies on the UK economy and society<br />4. The reduction in basketball spending from the Sports and Culture department (I didn't have a lot to say about that!)<br />5. Your summer as a Gamesmaker</p>
<p>Altruism spoke to me most as a topic</p>
<p>&#8220;Giving is more joyous than receiving, not because it is a deprivation, but because in the act of giving lies the expression of my aliveness.&#8221; &#8212; ERICH FROMM&#8221;</p>
<p>Volunteering culture was all over the news this summer with Olympic Gamesmakers yet I would argue that altruism is a lot more than simply one action. Instead it is a frame of mind, an attitude to cultivate. With that in mind I finish mentioning one of my favourite charities. Postpals is a charity which asks volunteers to send cards to sick children in the UK. It is a commitment of time and a small outlay of cost (stamps etc). I shared this charity with my class recently their sensitivity and compassion warmed my heart. In both sending cards myself and encouraging others to send one themselves I felt some of the joy that Fromm talks about in the above quote</p>
<p>Would you consider yourself altruistic? What do you give to your world around you?</p>
<p>Have a good day</p>

      \ the same.\r\n\r\nThe thing that ties them together is pretty obvious, namely,\
      \ that they are genetically modified. If you are against the process of genetic\
      \ modification, if you fall on the \u201Ctinkering with nature is wrong,\u201D\
      \ side of the fence, then this one common point is very important to you. There\u2019\
      s plenty of writing out there on this part of the issue, so let\u2019s move\
      \ on.\r\n\r\nWhat makes individual GMOs different from one another is the gene\
      \ that\u2019s added to the organism. I also think it\u2019s important what the\
      \ purpose for adding this gene is, who\u2019s doing it, and how and to whom\
      \ it will be sold or donated. I think the good/bad of a GMO is dependent on\
      \ these factors, not just the fact that it is a GMO. In light of this fact,\
      \ it\u2019s frustrating that the national conversation involves grouping all\
      \ GMOs together and ignoring the differences between what gene has been added\
      \ to the organism, what it does, and what it\u2019s for. If someone adds a gene\
      \ to a crop that makes it poisonous to humans or other animals, that could obviously\
      \ be bad. If someone adds a gene that makes a crop extra nutritious, that could\
      \ be great. I think this is the nuance we should focus on.\r\n\r\nSo, my point\
      \ here is: if you are against herbicide-resistant crops, you don\u2019t have\
      \ to be against all GMOs. If you\u2019re against all GMOs Monsanto produces,\
      \ you don\u2019t have to be against all GMOs, because other companies, and also\
      \ nonprofits and universities, can produce GMOs. If you\u2019re against all\
      \ patented GMOs, you don\u2019t have to be against all GMOs, because GMOs can\
      \ be unpatented and donated rather than sold.\r\n\r\nThere is endless potential\
      \ for different uses of GMOs, and we\u2019ve seen only a fraction of it so far.\
      \ I like to think of a possible best-case-type scenario to illustrate this:\
      \ a nonprofit uses donated funding to develop a GMO crop that solves a major\
      \ problem; the nonprofit works with the community affected by said problem to\
      \ tailor the GMO to their needs, then donates the seed for the crop. We don\u2019\
      t hear about many examples like this. But we could. This is why I care and why\
      \ I chose this subject to share with you all. The widespread, blanket rejection\
      \ of all GMOs makes innovation difficult. Let\u2019s talk instead about how\
      \ we can make them better.\r\n\r\nEmma\r\nemmathelistserve@gmail.com\r\nBerkeley,\

      <p>OK, now I&#8217;m going to bring up something that many of you probably feel
      strongly about, and I want to bring up one part of the issue that isn&#8217;t
      often discussed.</p>

      <p>Enter: genetically modified (GM) or genetically engineered (GE) organisms.
      What you get when you take a gene from one organism and put it into another
      organism. Sometimes these two organisms are distantly related, and sometimes
      they&#8217;re very closely related.<br />I just want to make one point: not
      all GMOs are the same.</p>

      <p>The thing that ties them together is pretty obvious, namely, that they are

      fence, then this one common point is very important to you. There&#8217;s plenty
      of writing out there on this part of the issue, so let&#8217;s move on.</p>

      <p>What makes individual GMOs different from one another is the gene that&#8217;s
      added to the organism. I also think it&#8217;s important what the purpose for
      adding this gene is, who&#8217;s doing it, and how and to whom it will be sold

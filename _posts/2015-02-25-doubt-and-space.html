      \ often revisit the following series of thoughts: We are made by the same stuff\

      \ and the universe, while at the same time being a part of it. In every one\
      \ of us, part of the universe is conscious, is aware: We are the universe observing\
      \ itself. I find both comfort and awe in this shift in perspective.\r\n\r\n\
      I am now finally and slowly making my way back to some incarnation of the dream\
      \ I had when I was a kid. It doesn\u2019t offer a clear path forward, and I\

<p>I wasn't really expecting to be given the chance to send out an email to everyone, so I'm not totally sure what I want to say!</p>
<p>I'm a student, and I can't really cook, so I think the best thing I can do is send out a couple of really simple to make (yet still quite nice) recipes. (It might give some ideas to other students out there!)</p>
<p>First one: Toad in the Hole. This one takes about 35 minutes from start to finish, incl. cooking time.</p>
<p>Ingredients:<br />3 fat sausages<br />1 heaped teaspoon white flora / trex / oil (or another cooking fat)<br />1 large egg<br />3 fl. oz milk<br />2 fl. oz water<br />Pinch of salt</p>
<p>1. Heat your oven to 220 degrees<br />2. Put the sausages in a roasting dish, and put in a heaped teaspoon of white flora (or something similar like trex). If you don't have anything like that, I've found oil works ok too.<br />3. Put them in the oven for about 10 minutes.<br />4. While they're cooking, put the flour, salt, egg, milk, water, and salt in a bowl together and whisk it together until all the lumps are gone. I usually need to scrape around the side of the bowl with a spoon to mix in the stuff that sticks to the sides.<br />5. After the sausages have had their 10 minutes, pour the batter over the sausages and put it back in the oven for about 20 minutes.<br />6. Serve with whatever you like! I like to eat it on it's own, but I've been told that's weird.</p>
<p>Second: spicy beef meatballs<br />This one isn't as simple because it needs a spice mix called ras el hanout. They don't sell it in the supermarkets around the university, but I usually pick up a pot from waitrose when I go home, and it lasts for ages. I've included it here anyway because it's really nice (it's a favourite of all my flatmates). It also takes a bit longer to cook, about an hour and 20 altogether.</p>
<p>Ingredients:<br />20 small beef meatballs<br />200g cherry tomatoes<br />1 large onion<br />2 tsp. ras el hanout.</p>
<p>1. Heat the oven to 180 degrees<br />2. Chop the onion up, and put it in the dish with the tomatoes and meatballs<br />3. Sprinkle the ras el hanout on top<br />4. Cover with tinfoil and put it in the oven for an hour.<br />5. Take the tinfoil off, squash the tomatoes and give it a stir.<br />6. Put back in the oven, without tinfoild, for another 20 minutes.<br />7. Take out and serve with pitta breads!</p>
<p>Finally: cookies!<br />This is the simplest (and one of the nicest) cookie recipes I've found.</p>
<p>Ingredients:<br />100g butter<br />100g sugar<br />1 large egg<br />175g plain flour<br />1/2 tsp. baking powder<br />1 big bar of chocolate (I like dairy milk best)</p>
<p>1. Heat the oven to 200 degrees<br />2. Mix together the butter and sugar<br />3. Mix in the egg<br />4. Stir in the flour and baking powder<br />5. Stir in the chocolate<br />6. Cover a tray with tinfoil/greaseproof paper, put the dollops of the mixture onto the tray, and cook for 12-15 minutes.</p>
<p>That's all I have! Hopefully this will give some ideas to at least a few of you.</p>

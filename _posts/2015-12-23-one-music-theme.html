      \ thought\r\nabout its original theme song. Who sing this song? I googled it\
      \ and\r\nfound that it was Regina Spektor. I learned that she was born in\r\n\
      Russia \u2013 in my country! And now she performs original theme song in\r\n\
      Netflix's most watched series. I launched itunes and found all of her\r\nalbums.\
      \ Her songs from these albums was very different from \"You've\r\nGot Time\u201D\
      \ (the show theme), but it was even better for me. Her songs\r\nhave beautiful\
      \ melody and harmony. My favorite album is \u201CWhat We Saw\r\nFrom The Cheap\
      \ Seats\u201D, I can listen it again and again. And (for my\r\nRussian readers)\
      \ this album contains two covers to Russian singer\r\nBulat Okudzhava. These\
      \ covers are beautifully performed in Russian\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019\
      s the way how you can discover something brilliant just start\r\ngoogling tv\
      \ series theme song.\r\n\r\nAt the end I have to thanks to Bobuk from the Yandex\
      \ team who shared\r\nto me and the Russian community \u201CThe Listserve\u201D\
      \ some years ago (I hope\r\nhe is still reading The Listserve emails).\r\n\r\

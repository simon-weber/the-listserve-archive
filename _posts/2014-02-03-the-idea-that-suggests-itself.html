      <p>the great thing about listserve is that it is based on such a simple idea.
      <br />I enjoy this random-based, non-hierarchical way of interchange since half
      a year. <br />Searching for simple ideas, for the idea that suggest itself,
      is what occupies me most as an conceptual urban artist. </p>

      <p>One day I entered an art school out of curiosity, smelled its atmosphere
      and knew what I want in life!  <br />That was 25 years ago and since then I
      got so many chances to develop and refine my artistic practice and have been
      able to travel the world with my partner as an artist couple for all kind of
      projects. </p>

      <p>To me, art is all about dealing with freedom. To pick whatever is interesting
      or unsettled, to research on it and to create a comment through this vast variety
      of media available nowadays. I wish that everyone who feels the desire to express
      and to create finds the courage and the means do so. To succeed and to fail
      and to start over again. And I am convinced that cultural exchange is a superb
      contribution to foster mutual understanding on this shaken planet. </p>

      <p>Try to appreciate art. Go for the weird things, the works that disturb or
      provoke you and learn more about their background. Talk to the artists and ask
      them about their motivation. <br />The art system might be difficult to grasp
      but every now and then one finds that touching piece which opens up a unique
      and unseen view of the world.</p>

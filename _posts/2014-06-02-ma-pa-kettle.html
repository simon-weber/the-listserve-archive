      \ \"You've always wanted to be a real doctor. Be a man, and go be a real doctor.\"\
      \ (My mom's words, not mine). So he did at age 36, with an 8-year old, a 5-year\
      \ old (me), and a 2-year old at home. Still, they both did a pretty solid job\
      \ raising us, especially my mom. And I know I wasn't an easy child - wetting\

      \ my mom decided she needed to be with me, so she and my younger brother came\
      \ back to Georgia. But my dad stayed. He stayed in West Virginia until he finished\
      \ putting me through Yale, and by that time, my younger brother needed his dad\
      \ back so he'd stop getting into trouble. So my dad shut down his practice,\
      \ and he came back to give it a go in Georgia in the middle of a recession.\r\
      \n\r\nFast forward to today, and somehow they're so damn proud of me, when they're\

      \ so proud, and I don't care. I was always more concerned with impressing other\
      \ people than with impressing my parents. For me, the impression hierarchy was\

      \ A couple years ago, I quit my job in finance to start a company (shout-out\

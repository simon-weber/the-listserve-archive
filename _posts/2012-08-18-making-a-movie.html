<p>I'm making a movie tomorrow. Well, me, and a bunch of other very talented people. It's a short film with a super-low budget. It's hard to know how these sorts of things are going to turn out (I've been involved in similar projects before), but I think it will be good. I'm a older than most of the people working on the project, some times a LOT older (I'm over 49!), but that doesn't really bother me (hopefully it doesn't bother anyone else!). I love how the internet has allowed all of us involved to find each other and share our ideas and make this project happen. I hope this is the first of many. And I hope anyone reading this that has some sort of creative idea that they can find like-minded people and they can get their ideas made. </p>

<p>It&#8217;s said that 72 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every single minute. Despite the site&#8217;s massive size, I find that my relationship to YouTube is incredibly personal. Looking back at videos I have &#8220;favorited&#8221; or clips I have filmed from low resolution smartphones provides a montage of meaningful moments in my life: that song that that somehow encapsulate my college years, that music video that transports me back to San Francisco, even that video a hippo letting out a massive fart. :) Each of these videos has special meaning for me&#8212;whether they&#8217;ve influenced the way I think, remind me of a specific time in my life or just make me smile.</p>
<p>At that end, I&#8217;d like to share a couple videos that provide a window into my life in a way that 250 words never could.  If you&#8217;re interested in taking a look, head to YouTube and search for them exactly as they&#8217;re titled below. (My YouTube username is jnewman1986...lame I know). I hope you find meaning in these videos as well.</p>
<p>The Vatican Run: An epic adventure<br />My senior year of college I traveled to Italy with my closest friends. We awoke at the crack of dawn and we made our way to the Vatican. We sprinted through a maze of corridors (and the world&#8217;s finest art) in an effort to be the first tourists in the Sistine Chapel.</p>
<p>Sony Bravia (Bouncy Balls)<br />I moved to San Francisco when I graduated from college. This video of balls bouncing down one of the city&#8217;s iconic hills was practically my only exposure to the city before I moved. Somehow the image of colorful balls cascading chaotically down a city street is an accurate metaphor for my time in SF.</p>
<p>Jordan's harrowing ride in Hanoi<br />A couple years ago I traveled to Vietnam with my family. We took a pedicab ride through the chaos that is Hanoi, which has no discernable traffic laws that I could make out. Despite the pandemonium, the city is bound together by a chaotic harmony that I grew to love.</p>
<p>No Woman No Cry Ziggy, June 3rd<br />Impromptu Ziggy Marley concert at a benefit I attended with my family on a summer night in Malibu. It&#8217;s rare to find music that everyone in my family can enjoy. It&#8217;s also rare for the entire family to be together and this night on the beach is one I will always remember.</p>

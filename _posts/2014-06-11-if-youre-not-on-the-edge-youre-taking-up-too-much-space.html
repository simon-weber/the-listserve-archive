      <p>Most people fear change, yet change is the only constant.  In learning to
      embrace change and what it means, you open yourself up to interesting possibilities
      in your life.  Be out there.  Push the envelope.  Dare to be different.  Have
      passion for what you do.  Take that risk.</p>

      <p>The Question Hootenanny</p>

      <p>Ask a question, get an answer. When you ask great questions, you often get
      great answers.  When you ask questions no one has asked before you may well
      get new answers no one has thought of before.   Try it.  Often.</p>

      <p>Get Shit Done</p>

      <p>Stop thinking about it. Stop talking about it.  Stop dreaming about it.  Take
      a few meaningful steps everyday to bring your vision into reality.  Concrete
      action.  Deliverables.  Milestones.  Screw procrastination, make things happen
      and get shit done.  Start today.  Start now.</p>

      <p>Better the World</p>

      <p>Do something with your life that helps make the world a better place.  Why
      not?  The more you make the world a better place&#8230;the better YOUR world
      becomes.  There&#8217;s no down side. Microfinance makes the world a better

      <p>Shits and Giggles.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve been happily married for 28 years&#8230;in a row&#8230;to the
      same incredible woman.  We have three amazing sons who are all wonderful, smart,
      kind, thoughtful young men.  We all work very hard at what we do and laugh our
      collective assess off a lot.  Shark Tank is our favorite show to watch as a

      startup founder, &#8220;You&#8217;re dead to me&#8221;. Okay, off track now.</p>

      <p>The Startup</p>

      <p>I&#8217;ve been doing startups for 20+ years.  Started one of the top 10
      interactive agencies in the world (according to Ad Week magazine).  40 full
      time staff.  Seven million in annual revenue.   Blew up at the end.  Bad mojo.

      pitch, 10 get funded, 100% decided by a live audience of 300 people.  All three
      things first of their kind in the world.</p>

      <p>90 Days to Cash Flow Positive</p>

      <p>Every company I&#8217;ve started since 1989 has been cash-flow positive in
      90 days or less.  I&#8217;ve never raised a dollar in venture capital for one
      of my own companies.  I&#8217;ve never written a business plan, and at this
      stage in my life&#8230;.I never will.  So it goes.  Starting a real startup
      is art.  It&#8217;s innovation.  It&#8217;s true exploration,  Not small businesses,

      passionate about.</p>

      <p>Do You Have a Startup in You?</p>

<p>The timing for winning the lottery is pretty good.  As a veteran from a family with a long military history, Memorial Day means a lot to me.  But not really for the reason that most people think.  There is a difference between Memorial Day and Veteran's Day.  Veteran's Day is the one where we give thanks to all that have served, but Memorial Day is supposed to be a somber day set aside for remembrance of those that have died serving their country.  It is just a day for a barbecue or a killer sale at Best Buy or the like.  It is not a happy day.  If you want to see what Memorial Day is really about, search for the video of the Marine that stood at attention and saluted for something like 6 hours during the Rolling Thunder parade in D.C.  He was there to salute his fellow Marines that could not be there because they made the ultimate sacrifice.</p>
<p>I don't think I can sum it up any better than my friend did today on Facebook.  She is a master sergeant in the Air Force.  She wrote:</p>
<p>"Please learn and teach your children the difference between Memorial Day and Veteran's Day. If you want to thank a Veteran - thank them on Veteran's Day or any other day of the year if you're so inclined."</p>
<p>"Memorial Day is set aside for remembering those that died while serving their country. It is not a happy day. It is a day of rememberance of comrades, friends, and family members who have fallen in service to their country. Never wish anyone a Happy Memorial Day. If you can't think of something more appropriate to say, simply say nothing. We understand and respect your silence much more than your cheery well wishes."</p>
<p>Thank you, Mic.  Well said.</p>

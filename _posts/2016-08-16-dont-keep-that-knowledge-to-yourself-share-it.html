    body: '<p>Hi everyone!</p>

      <p>Since 2005 I have been active on this website that was just gaining wider
      traction: Wikipedia. This website was working from a crazy concept: asking people
      to contribute knowledge, to co-author an encyclopedia without any compensation
      whatsoever. And somehow, it worked out just fine.</p>

      <p>The success of Wikipedia is visible in the way students do their homework,
      journalists get background information, or in how students understand the context
      of their materials better. Wikipedia is used to settle bets and disputes, and
      to satisfy curiosity. Who hasn''t started reading a Wikipedia article, and found
      themself later on a totally unrelated topic after clicking through a variety
      of links. </p>

      <p>What not everybody realises, is that Wikipedia is not created out of thin
      air. Wikipedia is written by some 80.000 volunteers around the world, and depends
      on three main factors that are all crucial to its continued existance. And your
      help is needed, to keep Wikipedia as good as it is, to improve it even further.
      </p>

      <p>1) Roughly once a year, depending on where you live, you''re most likely
      asked for a financial contribution. These contributions make it possible that
      there is a (technical) infrastructure, that there is a level of community building
      and that the software is improved.</p>

      <p>2) Wikipedia is a so-called ''teriary source'', which means that it highly
      depends on the availability of information and knowledge in other sources: newspapers,
      research publications, books, photographs. It is crucial that there is an ecosystem
      of fact checkers, researchers and journalists that collect and write up information,
      which is accessible to Wikipedians around the world. You can help by making
      your publications openly accessible, by putting your pieces out there. You can

      s married! I\u2019m about to be married! Heck, I was even at his wedding! No,\
      \ we can\u2019t. Bozo later tells me that things were getting ugly between him\
      \ and his wife. They drifted apart, and he drifted into psychosis. A mania fuelled\
      \ by his music.\r\n\r\nIt was frantic. It was crazy. It hurt. He sang of unrequited\
      \ love and of being as dirty as sin. He recorded a demo, and sought feedback\
      \ from Bozo. So he came to our party. We drank. We flirted.  We moved the party\
      \ into our beautiful city so we could dance the night away.\r\n\r\nMy bozo fianc\xE9\
      \ drank too much. Suddenly he\u2019s gone home. No goodbye. No explanation.\

      \ Yes! We danced to Bowie. We smoked clove cigarettes. We choke-danced to Death\

      \ No key to get into Bozo\u2019s house. He\u2019d be too drunk to answer my\

      \ got lost on you? Maybe it's time to reduce the uncertainty and randomness\
      \ around that thing? Is there something you could do right now? \r\n\r\nMy point:\

      we throw a die, and three comes up, was that randomness? Not really, because
      if we could throw the die in exactly the same way, the same number would come

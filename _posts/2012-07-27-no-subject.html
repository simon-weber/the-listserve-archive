<p>Here's a true story :</p>
<p>I was born in 1969, in 1977 2000ad - a British boys comic began. Not expected to last the year, the publishers using the hatch/match/despatch model (HATCH: create a new comic title and an excited audience looking for issue #1. MATCH: Merge a successful title with a less successful title, joining the audience together - usually heralded with the phrase "EXCITING NEWS CHUMS!" and, finally, DESPATCH: Shut down publication of the lesser title, saving money)</p>
<p>Issue 2 of 2000AD featured the introduction of the character "Judge Dredd". Designed as an anti hero, Dredd, unintionally, turned out to have a vast appeal to the kids who read it.</p>
<p>I was one of them.</p>
<p>When I was 14 years old I loved comics and computers but, comics were derided and computers looked like it could lead to a day job (in fact, I started working in computers at 14).</p>
<p><br />In 2000, when I turned 30 and 2000AD, unbelievably still in print, was finally catching up with itself, having realised that all I ever wanted to do with my life was to draw comics, I pushed.</p>
<p>One year later I was drawing Judge Dredd.</p>
<p>I've now been drawing comics, and Judge Dredd as a professional comic artist for over a decade. Dreams can come true. Though, sometimes, you have to play the long game.</p>

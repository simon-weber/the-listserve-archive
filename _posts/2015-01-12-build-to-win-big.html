      <p>My name is Dan Shipton. I am a father to a wonderful 5 year old boy and the
      CEO of Change, a small startup based in Des Moines, Iowa. Thanks for reading
      my contribution to the Listserve project.</p>

      <p>For me, 2014 was a shitty, get your teeth knocked in over and over kind of
      year. I focused most of my attention on saving a marriage that ultimately wasn&#8217;t
      meant to be at the expense of everything else. Basically, my life has been in
      maintenance mode for longer than I&#8217;d like to admit. So when I received
      the &#8220;You&#8217;ve Won!&#8221; email I literally laughed out loud &#8212;
      are there any worthwhile words I possibly write to 25k strangers?</p>

      <p>I had resigned to not write anything, but was gently reminded how I got this
      far in life by a couple word magnets strung together on the side of a fridge

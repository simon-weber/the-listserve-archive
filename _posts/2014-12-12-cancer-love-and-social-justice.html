    body: "When my mom called back instead of texting, I knew the news couldn\u2019\
      t be good.  I was in my first year of college, and I saw people flooding my\
      \ younger cousin\u2019s Facebook page with their sympathies and promises of\
      \ prayer.  I couldn\u2019t figure out what happened, so I texted my mom.\r\n\
      \r\nShe called back because my 16-year-old cousin Anna had been diagnosed with\
      \ cancer, and you don\u2019t simply text that to someone.\r\n\r\nMy faith became\
      \ wrapped up in my cousin\u2019s battle with cancer.  It sounds selfish now\
      \ to think about how much her battle and her pain became entwined with my own\
      \ faith journey, but it did. When my mom called back six months later to say\
      \ that Anna was cancer free, I knew God was present in that miracle.\r\n\r\n\
      When Mom called back three months after that to say the cancer had returned,\
      \ I felt myself starting to doubt a little more.  But God had done it before,\
      \ so he would do it again.  And by now, 1,000,000 people had pledged to pray\
      \ for Anna, so if God was out there he had surely received the message.\r\n\r\
      \nAnd then Dad sat across from me at a kitchen table and said, \u201CMom called\
      \ today to say Anna has passed away.\u201D  As my first real experience with\
      \ grief crashed over me, I watched the Santa Claus God I had constructed disintegrate\
      \ before my eyes.  As I yelled at God and fought with him, then decided we simply\
      \ weren\u2019t on speaking terms, then finally admitted I don\u2019t know if\
      \ God\u2019s even out there, I found myself drawing strength from a place that\
      \ had initially challenged my faith: a historical understanding of Jesus, one\
      \ that sets aside the debate of his divinity to focus on how he helped others.\r\
      \n\r\nI became captivated by the idea of radical love.  I saw radical love manifested\
      \ in Jesus, because that is my upbringing and my heritage, not because Jesus\
      \ or Christianity has some exclusive hold over those qualities.  Soon that radical\
      \ love became translated to justice \u2013 Jesus reached out to the people marginalized\
      \ by society.  When I attended a new church convinced that my doubts and my\
      \ on-again, off-again belief in God were flashing in neon lights above my head,\
      \ I heard the pastors call Jesus the first social justice worker, and everything\
      \ clicked.  I didn\u2019t need to check off items from \u201Cthe list of things\
      \ you must believe\u201D to be a Christian \u2013 I needed to make the world\
      \ a better place in whatever small ways I could.\r\n\r\nNow I study how people\
      \ talk about social justice.  I\u2019m fascinated by this concept and how people\
      \ not only come to understand it, but how they choose to act on it.  And I\u2019\
      m really curious to know what you think, too, because when else can I ask approximately\
      \ 25,000 people about their thoughts on social justice?\r\n\r\nThese are my\
      \ questions to you:\r\nWhen did you first hear about social justice?\r\nWhat\
      \ does social justice mean to you?\r\nWhat is something you do to make the world\
      \ a better place?\r\n\r\nThis is my challenge to you:\r\nWhen people prayed\
      \ for Anna, they tried to pray at 12:12, based on the corresponding verse in\
      \ Romans.  Now December 12th has become a special day in the life of the 1Million4Anna\
      \ Foundation created to honor Anna\u2019s beautiful spirit.  So in memory of\
      \ Anna and all of the inspiring warriors who have brightened our worlds, I would\
      \ challenge you to brighten a child\u2019s day on December 12th.  Together we\
      \ will make the world a better place.\r\n\r\nFloat on, Anna.\r\n\r\nLaura K\r\

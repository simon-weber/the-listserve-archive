    body: "I still vividly remember a moment when I was contemplating having kids,\
      \ and a well-meaning male friend said to me: When you are a mom, you are always\
      \ guilty. He went on, \"If you work outside the house, you feel guilty about\
      \ leaving your kids with someone else, and if you stay at home, you feel guilty\
      \ about not leveraging your education and experience and thus not contributing\
      \ to the household income.\"\r\n\r\nI didn\u2019t agree and found this theory\
      \ disempowering. However, I didn\u2019t have kids then so couldn\u2019t speak\
      \ from experience.\r\n\r\nToday, I do have a 17-month-old son and I think a\
      \ lot about guilt and motherhood.\r\n\r\nNow, I believe it is deeply problematic\
      \ for our ourselves, our families, our professions and society at large, if\
      \ we as mothers live in chronic guilt.\r\n\r\nYes, the choices we have to make,\
      \ and the tradeoffs we balance, are incredibly hard. I haven\u2019t figured\
      \ it all out yet and often wish parts of my life were different or that I had\
      \ made a few different choices around work earlier in my career. But for the\
      \ most part I am content. The truth is that the word guilt doesn\u2019t exist\
      \ in my vocabulary.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t chronically worry that my working outside\
      \ the home will harm my child. I don't fret that he is harmed by having parents\
      \ with professional lives outside the home. Nor do I experience deep anguish\
      \ that I'm doing something wrong by working. I'm largely content.\r\n\r\nAnd\
      \ yet, I still cry.\r\n\r\nI cry because when I am at work, I miss being with\
      \ my son Vivaan. Every time, I see a baby or a toddler in my office caf\xE9\
      , I secretly wish that I was having lunch with my little munchkin, holding him\
      \ one more time, giving him another hug. I miss spending more time with him\
      \ at the sandbox. My heart yearns for more time at the playground and tears\
      \ trickle down my cheeks. As much as I appreciate the peace and quiet after\
      \ bedtime on a Sunday evening, I also fondly cherish the wonderful time on the\
      \ weekend and know that Monday will not be like Sunday.\r\n\r\nI am blessed\
      \ to be working for an incredibly supportive manager at an organization that\
      \ understands the needs of families. My husband is an amazing father doing his\
      \ share to raise our son. We both chose our jobs consciously in order to integrate\
      \ our professional lives with our lives at home. When I look at our family life\
      \ in chunks of weeks, I feel content.\r\n\r\nBut, I still cry.\r\n\r\nI make\
      \ peace by reminding myself how blessed I am to have someone in my life I can\
      \ love so dearly that even when I am three miles away from him and see him everyday,\
      \ sleep next to this little being, I miss him so dearly. No matter how many\
      \ hours I have, my heart wants more. It is a struggle between being content\
      \ with what I have and constantly feeling like I wish I had a few more minutes\
      \ with him.\r\n\r\nI also make peace by reminding myself that I choose to work\
      \ and refrain from using language that says but \u201CI have to work.\u201D\
      \ Sure, I am a significant contributor to the income in our home but again,\
      \ I am choosing financial security, intellectual stimulation and a career I\
      \ care about. All of these are choices that come with consequences. There are\
      \ millions of Americans, raising very happy, successful and resilient kids on\
      \ one income or two part-time incomes. There are also millions of women, many\
      \ with better educations and more career options than I, choosing to spend their\
      \ time raising their families full-time. I have nothing but respect and admiration\
      \ for them. But I know that we have found the right balance for our family.\r\
      \n\r\nI don\u2019t know if the tears will ever stop. Part of me wishes that\
      \ they do and I could spend every minute that I am not with Vivaan being fully\
      \ present at the task in hand but part of me hopes that I always love my child\
      \ and enjoy his presence enough that I miss him every time I am not with him.\r\
      \n\r\nMy tears are not full of guilt, remorse or regret but with love\u2014\
      pure love, big love, mommy love.\r\n\r\nSending love to all the moms in the\

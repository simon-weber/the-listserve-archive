      \ belongings into my brother's garage on Vancouver Island, taken a month-long\
      \ solo camping road trip down the west coast and across the states, come back\
      \ to my hometown of London, Canada, to help out my folks with their dog kennel\
      \ business over the busy summer, while they tend to elderly relatives, spent\

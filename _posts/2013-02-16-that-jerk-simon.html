<p>&#8220;U Make Me Want To Drink Bleach&#8221; by Easyworld reminds me of that jerk Simon I dated in London in 2002.  My friends all told me he was an asshat, but boy did I fall for his posh accent and effort hair.  When he introduced me to his favorite band-of-the-moment, Easyworld, I immediately adopted it as my favorite band-of-the moment.</p>
<p>A week later, we&#8217;re stood outside a venue where they&#8217;re playing, and I&#8217;m begging passersby for tickets to the sold-out show.  Romantic, right?  After listening to my sob story, their manager comped us a pair of tickets.  Inside the venue, rather than &#8220;thanks, Eric!&#8221; Simon just looked up and told me, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take a Jack and Coke&#8221;.  I dumped him before the encore.</p>

<p>I was an exchange student to Brandenburg, Germany in 1993.  Arriving at the train station, I was picked up by a somewhat radical punk-rock-looking loving-our-newfound-Western-freedoms host family with whom I couldn&#8217;t yet communicate with due to language barriers.  15yo me (fresh from Indiana) was absolutely terrified.</p>
<p>We drove home in silence, until &#8220;Master &amp; Servant&#8221;&#8212;and if you know me, you know how much I love Depeche Mode&#8212;came on the East German radio station.  Everyone started singing along: father, mother, sister, brother&#8212;I couldn&#8217;t believe it.  Ice broken.</p>

<p>Depeche Mode&#8217;s &#8220;Photographic&#8221; was playing two months later when I stepped into my first discotheque with Lars, my &#8220;supercool&#8221; host brother who I was secretly in love with.</p>
<p>Inside the disco, throbbing synthpop washed over my body. There were smoke machines and strobe lights and everyone was wearing black denim jean jackets and smoking and drinking beer.  I wanted to stay there forever.  I spent most of my 20s &#8220;there&#8221;.</p>

<p>I lived a lonely existence during the dot-com days in San Francisco.  I&#8217;ll never forget sitting at home one night after a long day of working too hard on some bullshit website, lights off, windows open, fog rolling into and out of my apartment, with Pet Shop Boys&#8217; &#8220;Nightlife&#8221; album booming, thinking &#8220;why am I wasting my time doing something I hate?&#8221;  Years later, seeing their musical &#8220;Closer to Heaven&#8221; brought me to tears&#8212;each number resonating with me in such silly ways.</p>
<p>When I left the software world for a few years to try my hand at journalism, I was lucky enough to interview Neil and Chris.  After the interview backstage at the BBC, they tried to set me up the spot with another journalist.  While there wasn't a spark, we're great friends to this day, and have shared a hundred musical adventures since.</p>

<p>Last year, I dressed up as a sequined, quaffed Vanilla Ice for Halloween, and danced around the streets of post-Sandy Manhattan.  22 years earlier, "Ice Ice Baby" was the first CD single I owned.  My costume was recognized just once, by a handsome lad dressed as a &#8220;Book of Mormon&#8221; Mormon.  You should see the bizarre (yet adorable!) photo of the two of us.  My costume is safely retired, at least until our wedding reception.</p>

<p>P.S. I&#8217;ve spent the last 6 months working on a new social music iPhone app called Stereotypes, centered around sharing these musical moments with friends.  I&#8217;d love for you to try it out when it launches next week&#8212;just follow @stereotypesfm.</p>

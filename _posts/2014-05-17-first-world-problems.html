    body: "As I advance through my High School career as a teenager, I'm subjected\

      \ teenagers are supposed to be: rude, dumb, and with no respect for others.\
      \ These intrigue me as I don't think I fulfill the first two expectations, and\
      \ so when I see the old lady or nice couple cross the street to avoid my slowly\
      \ advancing mob of friends as we walk down a street to dairy queen during lunch,\
      \ making the most of our combination of free time and disposable income that\
      \ most people tell me I don't appreciate enough. I tend to think what I'm supposed\
      \ to feel. Do I get angry? We have no reason to be intimidating but most people\
      \ see us as so, and it could be because we are so concerned about what impression\
      \ we make on our other teenage friends that we loose sight of trying to fit\
      \ into that illusive box of normal for the rest of the world, but I don't quite\
      \ think thats it. Do I sympathize? We are taking up the whole street, and a\
      \ mob of anyone be it teenagers or disgruntled workers is something that most\
      \ people avoid for good reason, the mob mentality is a frightening thing that\
      \ doesn't regret or think until the morning after. Although at the end of the\
      \ day there is nothing I can do, I can't change the past, and I unfortunately\
      \ lack the telepathic communication powers of Professor X. As for the third\
      \ one, that stumps me. How does one know if they don't have the proper respect\
      \ for something? It reminds me of when I am packing for a trip to some relative\
      \ that I apparently met once when I was three, and am assured that they are\
      \ family, even though the only communication I've ever had with them is the\
      \ christmas cards and infrequent comments on facebook pictures saying something\
      \ along the lines of \"Oh he is so big, I remember when he was just this tall.\"\
      \ I'm packing this bag without a list and know that there is something that\
      \ I am supposed to remember to get, but how can you remember a thing you have\
      \ forgotten? So I leave without it, and when all is said and done it turns out\
      \ it wasn't that important anyway. But respect is different and it's hard to\
      \ gauge how much I am supposed to have for someone. Someone like my dad, who\
      \ has not done anything to change the world, but has the dedication and love\
      \ to raise a child. He is someone I respect, but am I supposed to respect him\
      \ less than someone else? Am I supposed to hold more respect for someone who\
      \ has done something great but I have never met? There is no hand out to tell\
      \ me these things, although it seems like everyone expects me to have one, and\
      \ it's even harder to gauge the amount of respect I am supposed to give because\
      \ I tend to get less just because of my age. It kind of reminds me of the studies\
      \ on the effect of sugar on children. (Really interesting, but I can't link\
      \ anything so you will have to find it yourself, sorry!) These studies show\
      \ that even though sugar has no effect on the brains of children, when parents\
      \ are told that their children were fed snacks with a bunch of sugar in them\
      \ they act a lot more obsessive over behavior than the parents who weren't \"\
      informed\" about the snacks. And even though neither group of children actually\
      \ ate any sugar, when asked to describe how their children were acting the parents\
      \ who were told that they did used words such as \"troublesome\" and \"difficult\"\
      , the study shows that the effect is purely physiological, and is caused by\
      \ the children acting how they think they are supposed to act, and also the\
      \ parents having this massive placebo effect when judging behavior and disciplining\
      \ their own children. This is similar to something called the label theory,\
      \ which admittedly I am less knowledgeable on. From what I know it basically\
      \ states that the very act of treating something like they are going to do something,\
      \ will make them more likely to do that thing. Whether thats acting hyper and\
      \ troublesome, or being calm. From being stupid, to being an overachiever.\r\
      \nThere is no life advice in this email, and I don't think I'm really in a position\
      \ to give that kind of advice when I am struggling to figure out my life still,\

<p>When I first signed up for The Listserve some time ago I was full of skepticism, hopes and&#160;delusion. Then the projects started and I started to&#160;receive&#160;email after email; Beautiful words forming advice, tips and precautions that everyone really should take part of. Irregardless of it's purpose - it is fun hearing about other people.</p>
<p>Myself, I am some what of a metaphorically half-blind Sherlock Holmes and have some academic background in everything human.&#160;What I would like to add is some, although&#160;paradoxical, insight into the human condition. The problem, as I see it with most things in life, is that 99% of people never ever - listen - to - advice. You have your life and live it by the understanding your experiences have shaped over time. &#160;It takes a unique openness and self control - insight - to actually adapt your life to things you have not yet realized yourself.&#160;</p>
<p>Be aware!</p>

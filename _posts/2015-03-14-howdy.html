      <p>The point is, you have to be exactly who and what you want to be.</p>

      to make their marriages or their children seem better than they actually are.
      And for what? Appearances! Appearances don&#8217;t count for diddly.</p>

      <p>When it&#8217;s all said and done, all that counts is what was true, and
      truly felt, and how we treated one another. And that&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>

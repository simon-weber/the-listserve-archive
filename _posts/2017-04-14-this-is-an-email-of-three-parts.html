      \ the same beach as our first date.  It had just stopped raining, the fog was\
      \ thick and the ferry was leaning on the foghorn as it entered the harbor. \
      \ We walked out into the fog on a long pile of rocks and with the same butterflies\

      \ Canal in upstate NY.  Through Ohio on rails to trails paths.  Down Mississippi\
      \ along the Natchez Trace Parkway.  I spent the winter in New Orleans getting\
      \ to know my extended family.  Texas was tough.  New Mexico beautiful.  In Colorado\
      \ I lived at a whitewater rafting company for three weeks.  I was a guest at\

      \ into countless peoples homes and given food and shelter. I camped out in amazing\
      \ places with coyotes yipping and yowling.  I spent an endless amount of time\

      \ months we emailed back and forth hundreds of emails that eventually became\
      \ each others life stories.  For the first time I told someone what I was biking\

    NY Times, 2007</p>

    <p><br />This is about a quest. An ordinary quest -- no dragons, sorcerers, mythical
    beasts. I wish. This is about my journey into the soul. Now I know what you''re
    thinking. Not another egotistical self-absorbed desperate whiny journey into the
    soul.* Why would you want to read that? No. Like I said, this is about a quest.</p>

    <p>Step one: Abandon &gt;all&lt; earthly possessions.</p>

    <p>    Well, almost. I have a backpack. A light one, with no more than a few toiletries,
    sleeping bag, a few extra shirts.<br />    And I have a boyfriend, whom I love
    almost as much as life itself. He&#8217;s not coming with me. I can&#8217;t even
    imagine life without him. He is Mr. Perfect in every sense of the word. His name
    is Michael. I could write a whole book about how much I love Michael. In fact,
    I did. It&#8217;s my diary. Not for publication.<br />    Anyway, he is the reason
    why Step #2 is REALLY REALLY HARD!</p>

    <p>Step two: Buy a 1-way ticket to the other side of the world.</p>

    <p>Step #3: Go on the greatest adventure of your young life.</p>

    <p>But before I get ahead of myself, like I said, this is about a quest. There
    is a back story. In order to appreciate the full meaning of the quest, you need
    to know the back story. If you would rather skip right to the adventure, see p.
    __ (How to talk your way out of paying police bribes in Nepal) or maybe p. __
    (Sleeping through terrorist attacks outside your window). But trust me, you want
    the back story.</p>

    <p>Like many young middle-class Americans, I went to college. I went to a good
    college, University of Washington.</p>

    <p>No, wait. Back up. This whole mess started with the SAT. That fucking standardized

    to go to art school. But my parents, of course, wanted me to go to a respectable
    school and pursue a respectable career -- one that would actually make money.</p>

    <p>Sound familiar?? Doesn&#8217;t every young person go through something like
    this???</p>

    <p>So I took the SAT. And I got my score, like everyone else. But while everyone
    else was looking at their scores thinking &#8220;Fuck, I&#8217;ll never get into
    Harvard with a 1080!&#8221; I was looking at my score thinking someone vastly
    OVER-estimated my intelligence. Someone at the switch messed up. Pushed a button.
    Dropped a box full of files. Maybe some poor sorry 22 year-old at the SAT office

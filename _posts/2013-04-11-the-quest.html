<p>CHASING BLISS<br />-----------------------</p>
<p><br />Someday some hypermanic kid<br />will produce a moronically maxed-out adventure odyssey<br />that will spark the overdue rebellion<br />among all the over-pressured SAT grinds,<br />and us grumpy midlife critics<br />will get to witness a new Kerouac,<br />and the greatest pent-up young-life crisis<br />in the history of the world.<br />    - David Brooks, &#8220;Sal Paradise at 50,&#8221; NY Times, 2007</p>
<p><br />This is about a quest. An ordinary quest -- no dragons, sorcerers, mythical beasts. I wish. This is about my journey into the soul. Now I know what you're thinking. Not another egotistical self-absorbed desperate whiny journey into the soul.* Why would you want to read that? No. Like I said, this is about a quest.</p>
<p>Step one: Abandon &gt;all&lt; earthly possessions.</p>
<p>    Well, almost. I have a backpack. A light one, with no more than a few toiletries, sleeping bag, a few extra shirts.<br />    And I have a boyfriend, whom I love almost as much as life itself. He&#8217;s not coming with me. I can&#8217;t even imagine life without him. He is Mr. Perfect in every sense of the word. His name is Michael. I could write a whole book about how much I love Michael. In fact, I did. It&#8217;s my diary. Not for publication.<br />    Anyway, he is the reason why Step #2 is REALLY REALLY HARD!</p>
<p>Step two: Buy a 1-way ticket to the other side of the world.</p>
<p>Step #3: Go on the greatest adventure of your young life.</p>
<p>But before I get ahead of myself, like I said, this is about a quest. There is a back story. In order to appreciate the full meaning of the quest, you need to know the back story. If you would rather skip right to the adventure, see p. __ (How to talk your way out of paying police bribes in Nepal) or maybe p. __ (Sleeping through terrorist attacks outside your window). But trust me, you want the back story.</p>
<p>Like many young middle-class Americans, I went to college. I went to a good college, University of Washington.</p>
<p>No, wait. Back up. This whole mess started with the SAT. That fucking standardized test. During high school, I was convinced I was going to be an artist. I wanted to go to art school. But my parents, of course, wanted me to go to a respectable school and pursue a respectable career -- one that would actually make money.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?? Doesn&#8217;t every young person go through something like this???</p>
<p>So I took the SAT. And I got my score, like everyone else. But while everyone else was looking at their scores thinking &#8220;Fuck, I&#8217;ll never get into Harvard with a 1080!&#8221; I was looking at my score thinking someone vastly OVER-estimated my intelligence. Someone at the switch messed up. Pushed a button. Dropped a box full of files. Maybe some poor sorry 22 year-old at the SAT office never learned how to alphabetize, mixed up Sarah Ouderkirk with Sarah Actually-wants-to-go-to-college, or Sarah Grew-up-in-the-Ghetto-and-really-deserves-this-opportunity, or a BILLION other Sarahs ...</p>
<p>But there was no mistake. I was doomed. Cursed with an above-average SAT score, my  parents and everyone else expected me to go to college.</p>
<p>So I applied.</p>

<p>I stopped reading the listserve a while back because everyone seemed to be ranting about ways to live your life. I'm young (going off to college in the fall) and still figuring things out, so I don't exactly have any great wisdom to give you all, sorry. I thought about not writing this however, but it seemed cool enough to be a shame to give up. I'm pretty busy with things right now, so this is mostly just a rough draft. I'll leave you with the last book I read and movie I watched, maybe you'll like them too; "museum of innocence" by Orhan Pamuk and "Drive". Both are pretty good I thought. </p>
<p>Good luck with things. </p>

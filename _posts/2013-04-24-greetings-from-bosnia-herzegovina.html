      \ many others on ListServe, I was both excited and mortified when I received\
      \ the \"You've been selected\" email from ListServe. What can I say to 20,000+\
      \ people? What should I write? How will my email compare to others that came\
      \ before me? I pondered this question for a while before finally deciding to\
      \ share 10 things about my country (in no particular order) that you might not\
      \ know.\r\n\r\n1. \"World War I\" broke out as a consequence of Archduke Franz\
      \ Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and\
      \ his wife, Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, being shot dead in Sarajevo (capital\
      \ of Bosnia), by Gavrilo Princip, one of a group of six Bosnian Serb assassins.\r\
      \n\r\n2. The 1984 Winter Olympics, the XIV Olympic Winter Games, were held in\
      \ Sarajevo, present-day Bosnia-Herzegovina.\r\n\r\n3. One of the last remaining\
      \ rain-forests (primeval forests) in Europe is located in Bosnia-Herzegovina,\
      \ near the border with Montenegro.\r\n\r\n4. Bosnia-Herzegovina boasts at least\
      \ two Noble Prize Laureates in Ivo Andri\u0107 (1961 - Literature) and Vladimir\
      \ Prelog (1975 Chemistry).\r\n\r\n5. Bosnian writer and director Danis Tanovic\
      \ won an Oscar in 2002 for best foreign film: \"No Man\u2019s Land\".\r\n\r\n\
      6. The Sarajevo Film Festival, an annual film festival held every August in\
      \ Sarajevo, is one of the largest film festivals in Europe. Founded in 1995\
      \ during the siege of Sarajevo, it has brought international and local celebrities\
      \ to the Bosnian capital every year since.\r\n\r\n7. One of the country's most\
      \ recognizable landmarks, Stari Most (Old Bridge), is a bridge built in the\
      \ 16th century by the Ottomans in the city of Mostar. The Old Bridge stood for\
      \ 427 years, before it was destroyed on 9 November 1993 by Bosnian Croat forces.\
      \ The bridge was rebuilt and reopened on 23 July 2004. It is recognized as a\
      \ UNESCO World Heritage Site.\r\n\r\n8. IrfanView, one of the most popular free\
      \ image/graphic viewers, was created in 1996 by Bosnian Irfan Skiljan.\r\n\r\
      \n9. Despite its relatively small population (approximately 3,750,000), Bosnia\
      \ Herzegovina boasts a number of past and present world recognized sportspeople.\
      \ Edin Dzeko (Football - Manchester City), Mirza Teletovic (Basketball - Brooklyn\
      \ Nets), Felix Sturm aka Adnan Catic (Boxing), Zlatan Ibrahimovic (Football\
      \ - PSG), Mirza Delibasic (Basketball - former Bosnia and Real Madrid), Hasan\
      \ Salihamidzic (Football - former Bosnia and Bayern Munich) all are of Bosnian\
      \ descent.\r\n\r\n10. Since 2005, a number of people have visited Bosnia to\
      \ see the \"Bosnian Pyramids\", a cluster of geological formations known as\
      \ flatirons near the Bosnian town of Visoko, northwest of Sarajevo.The pyramid\
      \ shaped hills are promoted by Bosnian author Semir Osmanagic as human-made\
      \ and the largest ancient pyramids on Earth.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading and write\

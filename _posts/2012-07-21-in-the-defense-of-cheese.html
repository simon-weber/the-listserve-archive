    \ Now, as stated before, my intention is to lecture the world about something.\
    \ This isn\u2019t something terribly life changing, but if you eat meat, you should\
    \ know this. Use a meat thermometer! People regularly ask me questions about cooking,\
    \ and when they do I usually ask them a few questions myself. One thing I find\

    \ meal is ready. The usual outcome is that otherwise delicious cuts of meat get\
    \ overdone. There is an easier way. For about $10 you can have a tool that will\
    \ tell you exactly when your food is done, every time. No more relying on some\
    \ formula or a pop-out button to determine if that turkey is done, folks. Stick\
    \ a thermometer in there! If the center is up to 170\xBA, it\u2019s done, otherwise,\
    \ it\u2019s not. No poking, prodding, test cuts, or other guesswork. A thermometer\

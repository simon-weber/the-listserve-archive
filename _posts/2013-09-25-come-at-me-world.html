    \ (why would anyone do such a thing?! ;) ) and asked if she could take my info\

    \ for a year and having to re-assimilate my life back into the fast-paced NYC\
    \ lifestyle. I had reached a low point in my life, feeling completely overwhelmed\
    \ and not knowing how to move forward. Then it hit me, I was so focused on all\
    \ the things I needed/had to do that I had begun to feel the suffocating grasp\
    \ of limitation. How could I possibly do it all and succeed? That was my problem.\r\
    \n\r\nThe realization struck me: our limits, if any, are self-imposed. How we\
    \ think ultimately determines how we do. Our capabilities truly have the ability\
    \ to manifest themselves if we can rid the boundaries we have mentally, and even\
    \ socially, created. All that they require is the belief in their possibilities.\r\
    \n\r\nI must say, I have heard from many that they need to see in order to believe\
    \ (with regard to faith, magic, science, etc.). In response to this, let me ask\

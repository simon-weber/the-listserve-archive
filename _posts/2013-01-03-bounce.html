      \ class, circa 1988. It is among my finest accomplishments.\r\n\r\nThere we\
      \ sat. Jean jackets and mullets. Acne and ennui. Begrudgingly studying the many\
      \ spheres: biosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, whateversphere.\r\
      \n\r\nThis day concerned a simpler sphere \u2013 a ball \u2013 and the effect\
      \ of the earth upon it. We were learning about gravity.\r\n\r\nThe teacher \u2013\
      \ nice guy but stern \u2013 explained that, thanks to the nature of gravity,\
      \ and potential and kinetic energy, a ball cannot bounce as high as the height\
      \ from which it's dropped. You've seen this countless times. Each bounce has\
      \ a successively lower apex until the thing peters out and comes to rest.\r\n\
      \r\nAs he explained this, a magnificent thought took shape in my mind. I was\
      \ 14 with a chip on my shoulder. I didn't like rules. And here before me, all\
      \ around me, was one big fat whopper of a rule. An irrefutable, fundamental\
      \ fact of the universe: GRAVITY.\r\n\r\nI raised my hand and, with a casualness\
      \ inversely proportional to the magnitude of my claim, said, \"I disagree. I\
      \ think it can bounce higher.\"\r\n\r\nThere were laughs, and the teacher wasn't\
      \ having it. \"No really,\" I said, \"I can do it. I'll bring a ball tomorrow\
      \ and show you.\"\r\n\r\nNow, this is no story of magic or delusion. Physics\
      \ is Physics. I couldn't possibly alter the nature of gravity. But I could,\
      \ and did, alter the operational definition of a ball. And so that night I applied\
      \ myself to the construction of the greatest ball ever made.\r\n\r\nThe heart\
      \ of it was a standard helium balloon, around which I paper-mached a sphere\
      \ of newspaper. The balloon's tapered shape left a cavity inside the bottom\
      \ of the sphere, within which I placed a raw egg as ballast, nestling it in\
      \ a hole cut into the nadir of the sphere.\r\n\r\nWhen finished it was a big,\
      \ unwieldy, misshapen thing. A busted Death Star. Yet also: an audacious invention.\
      \ An engineering marvel. And a brazen exercise in cheating. I was proud.\r\n\
      \r\nNext day I stood before the class and held it aloft. No one knew anything\
      \ of its innards. I must've looked clownish. The teacher was pure skepticism\
      \ and annoyance. But there I stood, reveling in the virtue of defiance.\r\n\r\
      \nI released it.\r\n\r\nI hadn't tested it, so I was going on faith. The weight\
      \ of the egg took it down slowly and I wondered if it would hit hard enough\
      \ to crack that sucker open and release its yolky ballast. Slowly it sank. Long\
      \ seconds went by. And finally, as gravity brought the thing to the ground,\
      \ truth and the moment collided.\r\n\r\nCRRRITCH\u2026\r\n\r\nIt rested several\
      \ moments as the egg leaked out, then tentatively began pulling away from its\
      \ snotty deposit. Slowly it rose, trailing yolk and albumen. Quicker then. Up.\
      \ Up past my knees. Passing my chest, my head. Up past as high as my hands could\
      \ reach. Up past the origin of its fall. Up to the ceiling, where it bounced,\
      \ petered out, and finally came to rest.\r\n\r\nI don't remember the class's\
      \ reaction. Only the teacher's. He dismissed it outright. It didn't count. It\
      \ was cheating.\r\n\r\nHe was right.\r\n\r\nBut he'd failed to learn the lessons\
      \ taught in class that day. That ingenuity arises in the face of impossibility.\
      \ That a thing is not always what it seems. That some things you can't change,\
      \ but what you do with them is another story.\r\n\r\nAnd that when things fall\

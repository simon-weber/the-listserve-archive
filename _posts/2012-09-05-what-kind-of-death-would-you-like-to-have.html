    <p>I am not asking my question rhetorically.  I am a doctor, and I need to know.</p>

    <p>A &#8220;code&#8221; is an emergency that sends a large team of doctors, nurses,
    technicians and others to a patient who is unresponsive, not breathing, or pulseless.  It
    is a frenzy of activity.  Unless a designated representative of the patient says
    otherwise, the team springs into action and determines whether to begin CPR.  The
    process involves much more than pounding on a chest for a minute, and that by
    itself can be violent.  Ribs are broken, and the patient rocks from side to side
    from the force required.  Orders are yelled across the room.  And if the patient
    does not begin breathing spontaneously soon, they may put a tube down his trachea
    and connect him to a machine that will breathe for him.</p>

    <p>On television, the survival rate when something like this happens is close
    to 50%. In reality, a patient whose heart stops has about a 15% chance of surviving
    to leave the hospital.  Survival does not guarantee quality of life.  There may
    be brain damage or other problems.  This being said, an attempt at resuscitation
    is appropriate for many people--and for many others, it is not.</p>

    <p>Your current state of health, age, and other factors affect your chances for
    a good recovery.  Depending on how things go, breathing machines, surgeries, loss
    of functional capacity, or rehabilitation may follow.  Think about this decision
    and discuss it with your family before you are hospitalized.  Ask your doctor
    if you need help. "Five Wishes" is a good place to start.</p>

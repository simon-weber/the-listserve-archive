      s talk about dogs, shall we?\r\n\r\nHave you ever wondered how dogs became \u201C\
      pure bred\u201D? Did God create each breed specifically? Maybe natural selection\
      \ after millions of years created the English Bulldog?\r\n\r\nDogs first became\
      \ domesticated when they learned that they could survive more easily by working\
      \ with humans than fighting against them. Once we started living with dogs we\
      \ started preferring the ones that worked to our advantage. We selectively bred\
      \ dogs that were good hunters, or good protectors, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the last few\
      \ hundred years we decided that dogs could also be companions, and accessories.\
      \ We could breed them to be tiny and portable. So we bred dogs to be what we\
      \ wanted, and then we gave them names. Pitbull. Rat Terrier. Pug. Bulldog. Labrador.\
      \ German Shepherd. Collie.\r\n\r\nIt is crucial to understand this: WE CREATED\
      \ \u201CPURE BRED\u201D DOGS. Dogs did not evolve this way naturally.\r\n\r\n\
      That doesn\u2019t sound so bad, right? We\u2019ve manipulated evolution to our\
      \ advantage. Sounds smart to me.\r\n\r\nIn theory - yes.\r\n\r\nHowever, in\
      \ the last hundred years things have gone sideways. We have placed a higher\
      \ priority on appearances, and the name of the breed. So much so, that we only\
      \ mate these dogs with their same breed, which has resulted in serious in-breeding,\
      \ and the progressive shallowing of the gene pool for these dogs.\r\n\r\nGoogle\
      \ a picture of what a bulldog looked like a hundred years ago. They were tall,\
      \ strong looking healthy dogs. Now, English Bulldogs can\u2019t even reproduce\
      \ on their own - they must be delivered via c-section because their heads have\
      \ become so massive over the years. They have numerous health and respiratory\
      \ problems because their faces are so squished. Their life expectancy is SIX\
      \ YEARS.  Why are we doing this to dogs??\r\n\r\nScience is showing us that\
      \ many many pure bred dogs are much more susceptible to health problems because\
      \ there is simply not enough diversity in their gene pool. Cancer, anxiety,\
      \ yeast infections, respiratory problems to name a few. I know an eight month\
      \ old Dachshund puppy with severe joint problems due to bad breeding.\r\n\r\n\
      So where am I going with this?\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest that we consider\
      \ mutts and mixed breeds as just as wonderful, if not more wonderful than \u201C\
      pure bred\u201D dogs. Their genetic diversity means they are much healthier\
      \ overall, they live longer, and they are every bit as adorable as that Pug,\
      \ or Frenchie or other \u201Cname brand\u201D dog that is so cute in the pet\
      \ store.\r\n\r\nI would also like to suggest that Kennel Clubs are furthering\
      \ damaging and archaic notions by refusing to allow the introduction of other\
      \ breeds to promote genetic health among pure bred dogs.\r\n\r\nThe reality\
      \ is \u201Cpure bred\u201D is just a thing we invented.\r\n\r\nNow I know a\
      \ lot of you reading this have pure bred dogs as pets. And I in no way mean\
      \ to devalue your wonderful pet and how special they are to you. What I hope\
      \ is that maybe some of you will reconsider before you walk in to a pet store\
      \ and purchase a pure bred puppy. Pet store puppies often come from puppy mills\
      \ - which is another serious issue.\r\n\r\nWhat if instead, you went to your\
      \ local shelter or looked up rescues online and saw what kind of abandoned dog\
      \ you might adopt? You won\u2019t pay thousands of dollars, just the shelter\
      \ fees. You won\u2019t encourage inbreeding or puppy mills, you will rescue\
      \ an amazing pet that someone else discarded. Maybe even consider fostering\
      \ - so you can pick a pup that truly fits your lifestyle. There are lots of\
      \ pure bred dogs who need to be rescued too.\r\n\r\nIt is my sincere hope that\

    body: '<p>Hello Listservians! Before I begin...</p>

      <p>I ask that if you choose to read this email that you do so with an open mind.
      I have no intention to offend - only to challenge a way of thinking. Please
      consider that :)</p>

      <p>Let&#8217;s talk about dogs, shall we?</p>

      <p>Have you ever wondered how dogs became &#8220;pure bred&#8221;? Did God create
      each breed specifically? Maybe natural selection after millions of years created
      the English Bulldog?</p>

      <p>Dogs first became domesticated when they learned that they could survive
      more easily by working with humans than fighting against them. Once we started
      living with dogs we started preferring the ones that worked to our advantage.
      We selectively bred dogs that were good hunters, or good protectors, etc.</p>

      <p>In the last few hundred years we decided that dogs could also be companions,
      and accessories. We could breed them to be tiny and portable. So we bred dogs
      to be what we wanted, and then we gave them names. Pitbull. Rat Terrier. Pug.
      Bulldog. Labrador. German Shepherd. Collie.</p>

      <p>It is crucial to understand this: WE CREATED &#8220;PURE BRED&#8221; DOGS.
      Dogs did not evolve this way naturally.</p>

      <p>That doesn&#8217;t sound so bad, right? We&#8217;ve manipulated evolution
      to our advantage. Sounds smart to me.</p>

      <p>In theory - yes.</p>

      <p>However, in the last hundred years things have gone sideways. We have placed
      a higher priority on appearances, and the name of the breed. So much so, that
      we only mate these dogs with their same breed, which has resulted in serious
      in-breeding, and the progressive shallowing of the gene pool for these dogs.</p>

      <p>Google a picture of what a bulldog looked like a hundred years ago. They
      were tall, strong looking healthy dogs. Now, English Bulldogs can&#8217;t even
      reproduce on their own - they must be delivered via c-section because their

      pool. Cancer, anxiety, yeast infections, respiratory problems to name a few.
      I know an eight month old Dachshund puppy with severe joint problems due to
      bad breeding.</p>

      <p>So where am I going with this?</p>

      wonderful, if not more wonderful than &#8220;pure bred&#8221; dogs. Their genetic
      diversity means they are much healthier overall, they live longer, and they

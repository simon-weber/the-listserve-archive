    \ write a public love letter to my wife, to my two daughters and tell everyone\
    \ why I have the greatest parents, in-laws, siblings and family. I wanted to discuss\
    \ the physics behind Baumgartner\u2019s recent free-fall from the edge of space,\
    \ share the world's best pie and cookie recipes, debate survival strategies for\
    \ the impending zombie apocalypse, and tell everyone why we should fight for capitalism,\
    \ small government and a return to the gold standard.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not going\
    \ to.\r\n\r\nInstead I will share a handful of my father's rules of survival.\
    \ Read them slowly:\r\n\r\nIt is always my fault.\r\n\r\nNo problem is bigger\
    \ than I am.\r\n\r\nNo one can offend me.\r\n\r\nNo matter how much good you do\
    \ in the world, someone will always be pissed off at you.\r\n\r\nHow you make\

    \ is never enough.\r\n\r\nFinally, and most importantly, because I cannot put\

    \ words is to direct you to search on Google the term \u201CI am a Mormon\u201D\
    \ and follow the top link. Spend five minutes there. Learn about Jesus Christ,\

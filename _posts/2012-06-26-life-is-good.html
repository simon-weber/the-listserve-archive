    <p>It was the day I received news that my visa to live permanently in Australia
    had been granted. When I opened the letter and read it I burst out crying. I am
    an Englishman and now an Australian, it''s not that I don''t like England its
    just that my family emigrated to Australia when I was 7 years old, Australia had
    become a part of me. Unfortunately they moved back to blighty 6 years later. </p>

    <p>In England I had  a good life and a fantastic job, so much so It took me 34
    years before I got back to Oz. I now live on the Gold Coast, Queensland with my
    wife and youngest daughter. Our middle daughter and partner are now in the process
    of emigrating bringing four of our grandchildren with them.</p>

    <p>Life is good.</p>

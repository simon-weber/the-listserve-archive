<p>You are what you know.</p>
<p>A contemporary view of intelligence finds that it is the sum of two factors:</p>
<p>G(f) is fluid intelligence- the size of your working memory, how &#8216;fast you think&#8217; etc.</p>
<p>G(c) is concrete intelligence- a measure of how much factual information you have acquired.</p>
<p>Learning more information then is the key to greater intelligence.</p>
<p>Hart and Risley (1995) found that children in non-working households heard, on average, 616 words per hour, while children from professional families heard 2153. By the age of three this totaled a difference of 30 million words. Less well off children are exposed to fewer concepts- and develop less concrete intelligence.</p>
<p>Research into memory and cognitive neuroscience has soundly shown that the learning of new material is much more efficient if you already know a body of linked material.</p>
<p>Eric Hanushek&#8217;s work suggests that a good teacher can get 1.5 years of learning growth in one year, a bad teacher 0.5. The consequences of a bad teacher for a number of years in a row can be devastating. Note that many of our most challenging schools struggle to attract good teachers.</p>
<p>Finally, we know which classroom practices most enhance learning and achievement. We have a well-developed science of learning- but you&#8217;ll have to look very hard to find proof of this in our schools. It&#8217;s long overdue that schools, classrooms and teachers applied what works, and the folk pedagogy and traditions that guide our educational institutions were replaced by evidence-driven practice.</p>

      t wait any longer.\r\n\r\nMy partner didn\u2019t want a dog, I did.  But as\
      \ the years past, he wanted a dog and I didn\u2019t.  He didn\u2019t want dirty\
      \ paws in his bed, or slobbery licking.  I was worried it would chew on papers\
      \ I like to have stacked neatly on the floor.  We both worried it would pee\
      \ on our beige carpeting, and leave hair and fuzz all over the house.\r\n\r\n\
      29 years later, we converged; we both wanted a dog.\r\n\r\nBut we had requirements,\
      \ lots of them.\r\n\r\nWe wanted a dog that didn\u2019t bark.  We wanted a dog\
      \ that didn\u2019t shed.  We wanted a dog that didn\u2019t go to the bathroom,\
      \ that didn\u2019t drool, that didn\u2019t chew on furniture, that didn\u2019\
      t eat shoes or paper, a dog that would never get dirty or lick, or throw-up\
      \ in the car. I wanted to dog that liked to be cuddled and would sit in my lap,\
      \ and my partner wanted one that likes to go on long walks. We were worried\
      \ about getting a rescue dog because we didn\u2019t want it to have psychological\
      \ issues.\r\n\r\nWe wanted a RoboDog; a manufactured dog that would meet every\
      \ single one of our requirements, the perfect dog that would not make a mess\
      \ and could do no wrong.  A dog that would give lots of love, and require no\
      \ care.\r\n\r\nOur friend who is a professional dog handler, suggested some\
      \ stellar purebreds, but we determined they come with their own sets of issues.\
      \  We read, and researched, and googled, looking for the magical mix of dog,\
      \ and how to make it our own.\r\n\r\nEventually we narrowed down the choices\
      \ to Maltese/Poodle and Bichon/Poodle for their combination of temperament,\
      \ lack of shedding, and intelligence.  Since these dogs aren\u2019t purebred,\
      \ we decided to take the risk on a rescue dog.\r\n\r\nWe checked out the local\
      \ No Kill shelter who told us these \u201Cdesigner breeds\u201D are snatched\
      \ up by local rescue organizations, so we emailed one of them.  We received\
      \ a response with a photo of Margo, an adorable 2-year-old female \u201Cbichon-poo\u201D\
      .  We made plans to meet 2-days later, 1-hour away at a dog park.\r\n\r\nThe\
      \ next evening during dinner we joked with our friends that we were going to\
      \ pick up our new daughter in the morning, in reality having no idea if we\u2019\
      d really end up with this dog.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the dog park, it was\
      \ love at first sight.  Margo came right up to us with a big doggy smile on\
      \ her face. We didn\u2019t know what else to do but to say, \u201COK.\u201D\
      \ After a lot of paperwork and instructions from the owner of the rescue organization,\
      \ we were walking back to the car with Margo on a leash.  As we left the park,\
      \ Margo was faced with a decision.  Would she try to follow the owner of the\
      \ rescue organization back to her car, or willingly go with us?  Without any\
      \ hesitation, she chose us, and marched confidently towards her new life.\r\n\
      \r\nShe buried her head in my arms and quietly waited to be transported to her\
      \ new home.\r\n\r\nWe believe that our silly notion of the perfect \u201CRoboDog\u201D\
      \ went out into the universe, and somehow manifested into the discovery of Margo.\r\
      \n\r\nShe doesn\u2019t bark.\r\nShe doesn\u2019t shed.\r\nShe potties rarely,\
      \ and always waits until it\u2019s time to go outside.\r\nShe never drools.\r\
      \nShe loves her dog toys, but never harms them.  She picks them up gently, and\
      \ moves them about, but none has ever been torn nor damaged in any way.\r\n\
      She never bites, only occasionally offering a loving nibble.\r\nShe never touches\
      \ paper, in fact, one of her only fears is the sound of paper.\r\nShe has no\
      \ interest in shoes.\r\nShe doesn\u2019t dig, so rarely gets dirty.\r\nShe has\
      \ gorgeous eyes that peer directly into yours.\r\nShe has a marvelous personality,\
      \ the perfect balance of energy and calm.\r\nShe gives lots of love, loves to\
      \ be cuddled, and enjoys sitting in my lap.\r\nAnd when my partner mentions\
      \ a \u201Cwalk\u201D, Margo squeals with excitement, and is happy to walk for\
      \ miles and miles.\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t overemphasize the joy of living with\

<p>I&#8217;d like to use this grandest of forums to attempt this grandest of experiments: to launch the new company I&#8217;ve been incubating for the past several weeks.</p>
<p>Presenting... The Listserve Launch:</p>
<p>Without patronizing the Listserve user and explaining the crucial role social media plays in a company&#8217;s survival, I will just mention that there are thousands of businesses shelling out exorbitant fees for the right to have a behemoth of a consulting firm manage their Twitter and Facebook communities.</p>
<p>Bottom line: I&#8217;ve created a lean company, built around a small team of savants whose greatest acumen rests in nurturing vibrant online communities. We&#8217;ve worked for national brands and hot VC-backed startups. And since our overhead is basically nonexistent, our full-service social media platform is available for a pittance of what one of the bloated agencies would charge.</p>
<p>If you know someone who could use our services, help us at Silicon Alley Social gain a little positive momentum and pass our name along. We&#8217;ll be sure to reward anyone who helps us propel this social media pirate ship.</p>
<p>Thanks for being a part of our Listserve Launch!</p>

  body: "A long time ago, I was hit with a sudden fever on my way home. As I came\
    \ out of the subway, I felt so sick I could barely keep my eyes open, and the\
    \ ten minute walk to my door (in the rain) seemed unfathomable. As I dragged myself\
    \ down the street, I was consumed with self pity, and didn't notice the two children\
    \ near me, splashing in puddles, until one jumped up close to me, spraying me\
    \ with muddy water.\r\n\r\n\"Watch what the fuck you're doing!\" I snapped at\
    \ them, my anger suddenly as hot as my fever. The children, drew back and apologized.\
    \ I composed myself, and gave one of my own. \"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have sworn\
    \ at you, but please be more careful next time\". My head swimming, I turned and\
    \ headed home. The kids followed. \"Do you live around here?\" they asked, and\
    \ suddenly we were having a conversation about the neighborhood, their school,\
    \ their friends. Before I knew it, we were at my corner. We said goodbye, parted\
    \ ways, and I never saw them again.\r\n\r\nI am still deeply thankful to those\
    \ kids. On what could have been a long march home, instead of feeling weak and\
    \ disoriented and sorry for myself, they kept me distracted, and the trip flew\
    \ by. I had no idea how much I needed it until it was offered to me. It can hard\
    \ for me to remember to be open to people, especially when they make mistakes,\
    \ just as I know how hard it can be to see what's going right when everything\
    \ seems to be going wrong. That moment, like so many others in my life, was a\
    \ reminder to give life the opportunity to show me what to be thankful for.\r\n\
    \r\nI'll end this with a shoutout to a group of people that always threw opportunity\
    \ my way, my second family, a college/community radio station in Montr\xE9al called\
    \ CJLO 1690AM. For over a decade, CJLO has let me contribute to and be part of\
    \ something bigger than myself, and for that, I will forever be thankful. I would\
    \ also be remiss to not thank Renata and Andrew, two people who, in their individual\
    \ ways, give me the chance to be a better person every single day.\r\n\r\nAnd\
    \ finally, thank you to YOU, whoever you are, wherever you are in the world. You\
    \ make someone's day better every day, and you might not even know it.\r\n\r\n\

<p class="meta">December 18 2012</p>

<p>A long time ago, I was hit with a sudden fever on my way home. As I came out of the subway, I felt so sick I could barely keep my eyes open, and the ten minute walk to my door (in the rain) seemed unfathomable. As I dragged myself down the street, I was consumed with self pity, and didn't notice the two children near me, splashing in puddles, until one jumped up close to me, spraying me with muddy water.</p>
<p>"Watch what the fuck you're doing!" I snapped at them, my anger suddenly as hot as my fever. The children, drew back and apologized. I composed myself, and gave one of my own. "I'm sorry, I shouldn't have sworn at you, but please be more careful next time". My head swimming, I turned and headed home. The kids followed. "Do you live around here?" they asked, and suddenly we were having a conversation about the neighborhood, their school, their friends. Before I knew it, we were at my corner. We said goodbye, parted ways, and I never saw them again.</p>
<p>I am still deeply thankful to those kids. On what could have been a long march home, instead of feeling weak and disoriented and sorry for myself, they kept me distracted, and the trip flew by. I had no idea how much I needed it until it was offered to me. It can hard for me to remember to be open to people, especially when they make mistakes, just as I know how hard it can be to see what's going right when everything seems to be going wrong. That moment, like so many others in my life, was a reminder to give life the opportunity to show me what to be thankful for.</p>
<p>I'll end this with a shoutout to a group of people that always threw opportunity my way, my second family, a college/community radio station in Montr&#233;al called CJLO 1690AM. For over a decade, CJLO has let me contribute to and be part of something bigger than myself, and for that, I will forever be thankful. I would also be remiss to not thank Renata and Andrew, two people who, in their individual ways, give me the chance to be a better person every single day.</p>
<p>And finally, thank you to YOU, whoever you are, wherever you are in the world. You make someone's day better every day, and you might not even know it.</p>

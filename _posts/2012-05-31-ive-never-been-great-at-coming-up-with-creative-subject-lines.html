    \ to Lebanon to Nigeria is an incredible one. It's the 21st century equivalent\
    \ of being given a microphone to talk to a massive audience of people from around\
    \ the world, people that you'd never normally meet. A really amazing opportunity,\
    \ but also one with quite a bit of pressure. I have to be honest, when I received\
    \ the email yesterday afternoon, I panicked. What could I possibly tell people\

<p>I am an avid reader of The Listserve. I love the concept of the group and I love receiving each day's email. So far I've learned so much from so many strangers - drink recipes with ingredients I would never have thought of, more information about bees and beekeeping than I ever thought I'd learn, the list goes on and on. </p>
<p>While I always hoped that one day I'd be selected to send out an email - I didn't expect the time to come so soon. To me, the chance to email almost 20,000 people in countries ranging from Belarus to Cambodia to Lebanon to Nigeria is an incredible one. It's the 21st century equivalent of being given a microphone to talk to a massive audience of people from around the world, people that you'd never normally meet. A really amazing opportunity, but also one with quite a bit of pressure. I have to be honest, when I received the email yesterday afternoon, I panicked. What could I possibly tell people that they didn't already know? I'm 22 years old - how many incredible life experiences do I have that would be inspiring to 20,000 others? </p>
<p>Some of my favorite Listserve emails so far have been those that contain inspiring pieces of advice based off of the sender's own experiences. I just graduated from college and I'm at a point in my life when I feel very young and very old at the same time. I have my whole life ahead of me, but now it's largely up to me to determine what my future will look like. I know I have a lot to share, but I also know that I have even more to learn. So, accordingly, I decided to solicit members of my own family - ranging from grandparents to aunts to parents to siblings - for pearls of wisdom that they've learned throughout their own lives. I figured that it might be more worthwhile to share inspiring quotes based off of over 250 years of experience, than just 22.</p>
<p>Below are some of my favorites:</p>
<p>"Walk through life being pleasant and kind to everyone you meet, knowing that your kindness will not only make someone else's life better, but also your own." - Morrie Zimring</p>
<p>"Keep on going, even if you feel like there is no tomorrow." - Susan Sale</p>
<p>"Those who bring sunshine to the lives of others cannot keep it from themselves." - Muriel Zimring</p>
<p>"When you lose, don't lose the lesson." - Miki Zimring</p>
<p>"Everything you're looking for lies behind the mask that you wear." - Miki Zimring</p>
<p>"Sometimes it's shit till it isn't shit anymore." - Lori Sale</p>
<p>"An unsolicited opinion is hardly ever heeded or valued." - Scott Sale</p>
<p><br />Thank you so much for the opportunity to speak to you all - I'd love to hear back from anyone and everyone. This is a great group and I'm honored to be a part of it!</p>

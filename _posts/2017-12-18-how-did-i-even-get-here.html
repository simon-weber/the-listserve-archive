      <p>I wanted to spend this moment to share something that changed my life. </p>

      <p>In 2008 I was failing college, and feeling stuck in my life living as a conservative
      Muslim in Michigan. I had to hide my girlfriends, my musical instruments, and
      the fact I was running concerts from my community. </p>

      <p>We met accidentally, and within 30 mins of meeting him Alec Resnick reached
      out to me a flight to cambridge MA, and a couch to sleep on. He said I didn''t
      seem happy in Michigna and suggested I drop out of school and leave home to
      start a new life in Cambridge, MA. </p>

      <p>It flipped my lid. It was impossible. I couldn''t leave my family. I was
      to stay at home till I was married! I couldn''t drop out of school! What about
      all that money and time invested! What about my girlfriend? My life? </p>

      <p>He planted that seed in my head within 30 mins of meeting him. Three month''s
      later I found myself in a car on an unknown street in Cambridge, freezing to
      death, wondering what the hell I was doing there. All I had with me was 3 bags
      of baby carrots, a Mitsubishi eclipse so broken I had to crawl in through the
      trunk, an address and a phone number. </p>

      <p>I could get into how this was the start of an unlocking for me. Of norms,
      of expectations, of traditions. Unlocking myself out of the shackels of fear.
      And all it took was someone to offer a base layer of security, a new floor to
      walk on different the one I had assumed was the only earth to stand on and it''s
      been the start of a 10 year long adventure. </p>

      <p>I''m now writing to you from Beirut Lebanon where I''m building a community
      home, offering a key for some of the youth I work with. A new life different
      than the one expected from them in the Ghettos here. </p>

      <p>So I offer you something beautiful. Something so simple, yet so rare. A concept
      you can consider bringing into your life. I call it the Care Contract. </p>

      <p>It''s simple, I would like you to find someone in your life that is needing
      some care, and promise them that you will be there for them, that if they ever
      need a couch to crash on, or an ear to listen, that you''ll be there. Learning

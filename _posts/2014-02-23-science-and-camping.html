      <p>Quote:  The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds

      <p>This one strikes true to me after being a math major who worked over a year
      on a lab-based microbiology senior thesis about C. Diff. I found that things
      never went right when I wanted, and always went right when I least expected.
      I had a knack of ruining the simplest of experiences, but accidentally coming

      <p>Joke: Always remember, camping is intense.</p>

      <p>Definitely a go-to, and those who know me well know that I will drop this
      line randomly on a fairly regular basis.</p>

      <p>So if anyone has any interest in science, my senior thesis, camping, or anything
      else, feel free to respond and strike up a conversation! I promise, I will try
      to respond in my free time from studying for these god-awful actuarial exams.</p>

      <p>Have a good day everyone!!</p>

      <p>I couldn&#8217;t have been selected to win the listserve at a less opportune
      moment. Three months ago, a year ago, or even a year from now I think I would
      have had many charming, insightful things to send to the many of you who enjoy
      reading these e-mails everyday.</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m in a very transitional place in my life: I&#8217;ve graduated from
      law school and taken the bar exam, of which I am awaiting the results. I am
      currently unemployed and waiting until I have passed the bar exam to apply for
      the one job I really want&#8212;to be a trademark examiner at the U.S. Patent
      and Trademark Office. I am currently homeless, living in cheap hotels, Airbnbs,
      and upon the generosity of friends and family until I find a permanent home
      in Washington, D.C. The person I love may need to move to the other side of
      the world so he can pursue his career goals, so my romantic life feels in transition
      too.</p>

      <p>My future feels very uncertain, and the more time I live in all my uncertainties
      the less confident I feel about the choices I have made. This is a new feeling
      for me, being uncertain, especially about the big things in my life, and I don&#8217;t
      like the feeling at all.</p>

      <p>So, instead of platitudes, and cheesy life lessons that I&#8217;m not qualified
      to give, here are some things that have make me happy, maybe they will make
      you happy too!</p>

      <p>Books: The Floating Opera, Kitchens of the Great Midwest, Garlic and Sapphires,
      Harry Potter (the audiobooks are my equivalent of drinking a glass of wine and
      taking a bath, the effect is that calming)</p>

      <p>Television: Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Friday Night Lights, The West Wing,
      Parks and Recreation, Veronica Mars, Top Chef, X-Files, the Office</p>

      <p>Music: When I was younger I kept up with music ambitiously, but as I get

      been listening to a LOT of Amy Winehouse recently. This will not make you happy&#8230;.so
      maybe&#8230;Devo?</p>

      <p>Podcasts: Podcasts are great because you can listen to them while going on

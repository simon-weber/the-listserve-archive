    body: "Hi Listserve!\r\n\r\nLike everyone else, I never really expected to win\
      \ this lottery, but here I am with circa 24K willing recipients.\r\n\r\nSo what\
      \ am I going to use my platform for? All GOOD, of course. I'm going to give\
      \ you some advice on being a better customer in a bar. See, I moonlight as a\
      \ bartender (I run the Manhattans Project, a little cocktail popup in London\
      \ (@ManhattansPRJCT)), and I love great customers.\r\n\r\nBut isn\u2019t the\
      \ customer's always right? Nope. The customer is never wrong, but they sure\
      \ as heck aren't as right as they could be. Very few drinkers know their spirits,\
      \ liqueurs, how to balance a cocktail, what fruit is great that week, and what\
      \ drinks a bar does best. Your bartender does.\r\n\r\nFirstly, stop ordering\
      \ mojitos.\r\n\r\nLet me preface this by saying the mojito can be a glorious\
      \ drink, but it's my b\xEAte noire. On a hot day, made well, it\u2019s really\
      \ up there. It\u2019s just, mostly, people don\u2019t drink them like that.\
      \ They order them in a panic at a bar, and the bartender gets some tired mint,\
      \ some halfway decent rum, a squeeze of lime, some sugar and throws them in\
      \ a glass with a handful of crushed ice. Then the drink gets topped up with\
      \ soda and you\u2019re left with something that\u2019s\u2026reliably drinkable,\
      \ but consistently mediocre.\r\n\r\nToo often, it\u2019s ordered by people put\
      \ off by over pretentious drinks menu, who begrudgingly pay \xA37. They\u2019\
      ve been put off other classic cocktails by warm, oily martinis and cosmopolitans\
      \ made with sour mix, so they\u2019ll take this. It\u2019s long enough to feel\
      \ like good value, and generally inoffensive.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me on to my\
      \ second suggestion. Find a bartender you like, trust, and maybe want to bang.\
      \ That bartender will look after you; they will show you magical new drinks\
      \ and tell you stories and anecdotes that will make you the life of any party.\
      \ They probably won't sleep with you. Sorry.\r\n\r\nOnce you have that bartender,\
      \ make them work. Talk to them about what you like. Tell them why you've never\
      \ quite got on with scotch, or gin, or fernet branca. They'll try to persuade\
      \ you, and sometimes they'll succeed. Other times, you'll learn a bunch about\
      \ what you like, and that's only a good thing. Ask them what they're drinking\
      \ at the moment, or what's new in the bar. See if they want to preview you some\
      \ drinks from the new menu, or test a new concoction on you. They probably do,\
      \ and your life will be better for it. Just don't order an old fashioned if\
      \ they're rushed off their feet.\r\n\r\nThirdly, tip. Tip early and often. You've\
      \ come out for a nice drink. Don't scrimp on this...you'll probably make it\
      \ back in generous pours, buy backs (when the bartender gets you a shot) and\
      \ fast service. You'll be welcomed back and you'll get to crash the occasional\
      \ lock-in at the bar and find out all the gossip bartender confidentiality allows.\
      \ Bartenders don't make rockstar salaries, and we rely on tips to put the jam\
      \ on our toast. Look after us, and we'll look after you. This is the hospitality\
      \ industry, after all.\r\n\r\nFinally, don't gender your drinks! Don't ask your\
      \ bartender for a 'girly' drink, or a 'manly' shot. You look like an ass, and\
      \ everyone around you thinks you're being sexist. Turns out flavours don't have\
      \ genders, and your bartender is going to laugh at you for thinking they do.\r\
      \n\r\nThat's it from me. Enjoy your listserve subs, and next time you have a\
      \ Manhattan, send me a toast from wherever you are in the world. Thanks for\

      <p>Like everyone else, I never really expected to win this lottery, but here
      I am with circa 24K willing recipients.</p>

      <p>So what am I going to use my platform for? All GOOD, of course. I''m going
      to give you some advice on being a better customer in a bar. See, I moonlight
      as a bartender (I run the Manhattans Project, a little cocktail popup in London
      (@ManhattansPRJCT)), and I love great customers.</p>

      <p>But isn&#8217;t the customer''s always right? Nope. The customer is never
      wrong, but they sure as heck aren''t as right as they could be. Very few drinkers
      know their spirits, liqueurs, how to balance a cocktail, what fruit is great
      that week, and what drinks a bar does best. Your bartender does.</p>

      <p>Firstly, stop ordering mojitos.</p>

      <p>Let me preface this by saying the mojito can be a glorious drink, but it''s
      my b&#234;te noire. On a hot day, made well, it&#8217;s really up there. It&#8217;s
      just, mostly, people don&#8217;t drink them like that. They order them in a
      panic at a bar, and the bartender gets some tired mint, some halfway decent
      rum, a squeeze of lime, some sugar and throws them in a glass with a handful
      of crushed ice. Then the drink gets topped up with soda and you&#8217;re left
      with something that&#8217;s&#8230;reliably drinkable, but consistently mediocre.</p>

      <p>Too often, it&#8217;s ordered by people put off by over pretentious drinks
      menu, who begrudgingly pay &#163;7. They&#8217;ve been put off other classic
      cocktails by warm, oily martinis and cosmopolitans made with sour mix, so they&#8217;ll
      take this. It&#8217;s long enough to feel like good value, and generally inoffensive.</p>

      <p>Which brings me on to my second suggestion. Find a bartender you like, trust,
      and maybe want to bang. That bartender will look after you; they will show you
      magical new drinks and tell you stories and anecdotes that will make you the
      life of any party. They probably won''t sleep with you. Sorry.</p>

      <p>Once you have that bartender, make them work. Talk to them about what you

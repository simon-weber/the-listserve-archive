    body: "I was 22, grew up in Cupertino, I was a high school dropout, I never used\
      \ a Mac before in my life, but I taught myself to make websites when I was 13,\
      \ I said yes to every task and was willing to work my butt off. So, yay, job\
      \ at Apple.\r\n\r\nI worked to help maintain knowledge management at Apple.\
      \ My role was to process documentation for M68 then prepare it for publication\
      \ to the web for the AppleCare portal, accessible for every market Apple was\
      \ in at the time.\r\n\r\nMy work was pretty much the tail end of the overall\
      \ creative process. By the time it got to me they\u2019ve already nailed down\
      \ legal, planning, design, software, hardware, service, and marketing.\r\n\r\
      \nBut the group I was in was just as important in contributing to the Apple\
      \ way, said my boss with a plaque signed by Steve on her desk for her 25 years\
      \ of service. We were AppleCare, after it is sold to the user we are the ones\
      \ to help you learn to use it and take care of it. We are our own line item\
      \ in the balance sheet, funded exclusively by extended warranty sales and we\
      \ broke even, not for a profit motive, and to always be there for the user.\r\
      \n\r\nOh, and by the way, you\u2019re working on this new thing that is certainly\
      \ not a new Apple thing, despite every diagram and text in the documents explains\
      \ the functionality of an ipod, phone, and internet communication device. Mmmkay?\r\
      \n\r\nSo I nodded and kept to my tasks, tasks such as making sure every reference\
      \ to this new Apple thing was never called the thing that everyone knew it was\
      \ going to be called. The same treatment went for Cingular. I had to prepare\
      \ diagrams, write tutorials, check stats, check messages, write little web based\
      \ tools, and prep for another secret project called M63.\r\n\r\nWhen I showed\
      \ up for work in January the team I was with sat around in the open area of\
      \ our floor. Someone rolled in a big fat television set on a media cart like\
      \ those you would see in elementary school, and we tuned in to the closed circuit\
      \ feed of the event. Most everyone else were in San Francisco Moscone Center.\r\
      \n\r\nAs the launch time approached, more joined us, grabbing chairs, and getting\
      \ a view however they can. My boss was perpetually glued to her 12\u2033 PowerBook,\
      \ but every now and then she would look up and grin at me with excitement.\r\
      \n\r\nSomeone next to us had their 17\u2033 PowerBook open and on the Yahoo\
      \ Stocks page for AAPL. Every five seconds the page meta refreshed, and the\
      \ price changed by a few cents. Then it was show time and everyone hushed. Steve\
      \ walked onto stage in Moscone, in front of thousands.\r\n\r\nAs the presentation\
      \ went on, the price kept going up. And up. And up. People kept clapping. But\
      \ not in the joyous type, the cautioned kind, the one of relief, the dramatic\
      \ kind like in that movie Apollo 13\u2019s command center. For them, they dedicated\
      \ much more than me. They get to live a normal life now.\r\nAfter it was all\
      \ done we all got up and went back to our cubes to go back to work. There\u2019\
      s still much more to do.\r\n\r\nAt Apple, on launch days there\u2019s a waterfall\
      \ effect. Marketing has priority, they would shut down access to the servers\
      \ until they were done pushing their changes. Also, Steve has final say on all\
      \ consumer facing consumer product marketing. So it could take minutes, or hours,\
      \ until it\u2019s to Steve\u2019s liking.\r\n\r\nI had to wait my turn before\
      \ I can get a shot at the servers.\r\n\r\nTo kill time I wandered over to the\
      \ kitchenette and grabbed a cup of coffee. We didn\u2019t have free drinks now\
      \ known in the startup world, we didn\u2019t even have snacks. Someone was just\
      \ kind enough to bring coffee that day.\r\n\r\nBack to my cube with the window\
      \ view of the parking lot, I sat down, saw the latest email in my inbox I was\
      \ waiting for, and proceeded to do the most important thing I had to do for\
      \ the day: in all my files I replaced the word M68 with iPhone. Then I clicked\
      \ Publish.\r\n\r\nJerry\r\nCupertino\r\njerrywang@me.com\r\n\r\n"

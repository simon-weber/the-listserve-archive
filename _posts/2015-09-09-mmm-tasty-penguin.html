      \ was an outdoor enclosure for the penguins, and I remember peering, my little\
      \ face pressed up against the glass, fascinated. They asked me if I liked the\
      \ penguins, and I gleefully exclaimed, \"Mmm, tasty penguin!\"\r\n\r\nThe shock!\
      \ People around with other children looked askance. Who was this monster child\
      \ who saw adorable penguins and immediately thought about cooking them?\r\n\r\
      \n\"No,\" my parents frantically explained. \"We don't eat penguins!\" I must\
      \ have smiled and nodded in some way that convinced them I wasn't some penguin-eating\
      \ freak, or a killer whale in disguise. We continued on to the gift shop, where\
      \ I picked out a reasonably sized stuffed penguin to take home. Maybe they figured\
      \ I was making amends, because I bought it and cuddled it all the way back to\
      \ our house.\r\n\r\nA few hours later, my mother came to check on me. I'd shoved\
      \ the stuffed penguin in my pretend oven, and I dramatically opened it up and\
      \ shouted, \"tasty penguin!\" again. I'd fooled my easily trusting parents,\
      \ and now I had a penguin all my own to cook. I don't know how they eventually\
      \ broke me of my penguin-cooking obsession, but at some point after that I moved\
      \ on to using a tiny faux blender to prepare a mixture of Cheerios and water\
      \ that only my younger brother was gullible enough to actually eat, but back\
      \ then he'd do anything I say. \r\n\r\nHe's a dad now, and I took my nephew\
      \ to the aquarium just before his first birthday, and crawled into the penguin\
      \ exhibit with him, a series of tunnels so you can be right at penguin level.\
      \ The nephew can't talk yet, so no inappropriate outbursts, but I did get him\
      \ his own stuffed penguin, just to see if this runs in the family.\r\n\r\nI've\
      \ told this story about myself for years, but it's taken me until tonight, at\
      \ 31, thinking about what to share with this Listserve, for me to actually search\

      \ in particular locations and circumstances (see Frederick Cook's 1897 excursion\
      \ and how it helped them avoid scurvy), just not small children on day trips\

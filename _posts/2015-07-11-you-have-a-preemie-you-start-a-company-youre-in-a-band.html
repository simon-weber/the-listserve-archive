    body: "1. It is the 23rd week and the doctor tells you that your baby won\u2019\
      t make it to 29 weeks.   29 weeks is where his odds of survival and against\
      \ disability improve dramatically.  You are shown charts with sharply climbing\
      \ curves.  You find where you are today.  This week, the odds of bad outcomes\
      \ are 80 or 90%.  Next week, they are a little better, maybe only 70%.\r\n\r\
      \nYou are asked: \u201CDo you want to stay at the hospital?  You can, but we\
      \ may take the baby sooner.\u201D\r\nYou are asked: \u201CHow \u2018heroic\u2019\
      \ should we be if there is no heartbeat at birth?\u201D\r\n\r\nYou and your\
      \ wife go home with your two older kids and Google these questions.  You discover\
      \ that these questions are hard to answer.\r\n\r\n2. So you decide to start\
      \ a company.  You did once before and it turned out well, with a successful\
      \ acquisition - maybe you can do it again?  You call your new company Roobrik\
      \ and start building tools to help people make complex, high-stakes, emotional\
      \ decisions.  You see both a need and an opportunity to focus on helping older\
      \ adults and their families.  There are hundreds of decisions, big and small,\
      \ and you realize they are the hardest most people will ever have to make. \
      \ It will be an honor, you decide, to one day help your parents have a good\
      \ life, and on a more distant day, a good death.\r\n\r\n3. Your band is called\
      \ the Day Action Band.  You have a 7\u201D on Numero and release three full-length\
      \ albums.  When someone asks you where to start, you say go listen to \u201C\
      All Comes Down to This\u201D all the way through, then maybe \u201CBack of Your\
      \ Car\u201D because you always liked those songs.  You put them all up on iTunes,\
      \ Spotify, Rdio, and Pandora years ago.  You include this section because (a)\
      \ like all musicians you expect that one day your back catalog will be discovered\
      \ by musicologists and ebullient youth for its shabby brilliance and (b) you\
      \ wonder if Listserve exposure will register on your quarterly digital reports.\r\
      \n\r\n4. Your baby was born at the beginning of week 26.  He was 2 lbs, 2 oz,\
      \ and lived in the NICU for two and a half months.  He came home with an oxygen\
      \ tank and got tiny plastic glasses.  But he thrived, and at 4 he is healthy,\
      \ as normal as any kid.  You are grateful for this.  For your good fortune and\
      \ for good doctors, nurses, and science.  When your blood type comes back, and\
      \ they tell you that, good news, it's teeming with rare antibodies helpful to\
      \ preemies, you make a quiet pledge to yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nNate O\u2019Keefe\r\

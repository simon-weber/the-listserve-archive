      <p>The Flash</p>

      <p>It happened one day, at a crossroads, in the middle of a crowd, people coming
      and going.<br /> I stopped, blinked: suddently I understood nothing. Nothing,
      nothing about anything: I did not understand the reasons for things or for people,
      it was all senseless, absurd. I laughed.<br /> What I found strange at the time
      was that I had never realized before; that up until then I had accepted everything:
      traffic lights, cars, posters, uniforms, monuments, things completely detached
      from any sense of the world, accepted them as if there were some necessity,
      some chain of cause and effect that bound them together.<br />Then my laugh
      died. I blushed, ashamed. I waved to get people''s attention. "Stop a moment!"
      I shouted, "there is something wrong! Everything is wrong! We are doing the
      absurdest things. This cannot be the right way. Where can it end?"<br />People
      stopped around me, sized me up, curious. I stood there in the middle of them,
      waving my arms, desparate to explain myself, to have them share the flash of
      insight that had suddenly enlightened me: and I said nothing. I said nothing
      because the moment I had raised my arms and opened my mouth, my great revelation
      had been as it were swallowed up again and the words had come out any old how,
      on impulse.<br />"So?" people asked, "what do you mean? Everything is in its
      place. All is as it should be. Everything is a result of something else. Everything
      fits in with everything else. We cannot see anything wrong or absurd."<br />I
      stood there, lost, because as I saw it now everything had fallen into place
      again and everything seemed normal, traffic lights, monuments, uniforms, towerblocks,
      tramlines, begggards, processions; yet this did not calm me, it tormented me.<br

      But everything is fine now. I am sorry." And I made off amid their angry glares.<br
      /> Yet, even now, every time (and it is often) that I find I do not understand

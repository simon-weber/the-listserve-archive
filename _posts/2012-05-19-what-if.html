    \ World Food Programme. We help end the cycle of hunger at three critical points:\r\
    \n\r\n1) 1,000 Days: We target hunger in the first 1,000 days of a child's life,\
    \ where damage done to the brain by malnutrition is irreversible.\r\n\r\n2) School\
    \ Meals: Then, we provide meals in schools - which boosts community attendance\
    \ by more than 50%.  This program allows children to receive nutrition as well\
    \ as an education. \r\n\r\n3) Sustainability: Our hunger work is done in a way\
    \ that treats the problem, not simply the symptoms. Our ultimate goal is to break\
    \ the cycle of hunger through not only feeding children, but educating them and\
    \ giving them thriving communities and self-sustaining economies so that companies\
    \ like Impact Foods no longer need to exist. \r\n\r\nBut for now, they do need\
    \ to exist. And we want to encourage you to start a conscious capitalism project\
    \ of your own. Our passion is hunger - what's yours!? \r\n\r\nSure, we'd love\

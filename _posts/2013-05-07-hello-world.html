    \ knew what to expect. That's true for all first-time parents. We did know that\

    \ bumbling dad was at best a gross stereotype and, at least in many cases, far\

    \ coming every 2-3 minutes. But they were weak contractions, nothing like the\
    \ full-scale occupations of mind and body you might read about while preparing\
    \ for your first child. Still, our midwife suggested we come to her clinic, and\
    \ we did.\r\n\r\nAnd we waited. The contractions came and went, came and went.\
    \ We slept, or tried to. It was thirty-six hours at least before my wife felt\
    \ a ~real~ contraction. The wait was annoying in some respects, but given our\
    \ caring midwife, deeply respectful of the natural birth process, we were allowed\
    \ to hang out comfortably, look after one another, and wait for the Real Thing.\r\
    \n\r\nThe moaning began. I have mixed thoughts on a lot of the \"woo\" you see\
    \ in discourse about this kind of stuff. When it comes down to it, one of the\
    \ more amazing and wonderful things about natural childbirth is that it simply\
    \ \"is what it is.\" Bodies do what they have evolved and developed to do, and\
    \ then there is a new sweet baby in the world.\r\n\r\nBut my wife experienced\
    \ some intense and wonderful visions at this stage, leading up to Transition (the\
    \ intense point where a woman shifts from cervical dilation to actually pushing\
    \ out the baby). We like to interpret these visions as an experience of her body\
    \ welcoming a new consciousness into the baby's body, and into the world. But,\
    \ hey.\r\n\r\nOne of the great things about working with a midwife was the closeness\
    \ and involvement I was privileged to experience as a father. I could be there,\
    \ on the bed, offering support and encouragement as needed, and looking out for\
    \ my wife's interests. All with her consent, of course.\r\n\r\nThat was autumn\
    \ of 2010. Our second child was born earlier this year, and while the arrangements\
    \ and preparation were very similar, the experience was much different.\r\n\r\n\
    We knew what to expect, for one thing. And, as many women attest, there is a huge\
    \ boost in confidence and trust in one's own body going into a second labor. In\
    \ a sense, it helps just to know It can be done.\r\n\r\nIt was fast. We arrived\
    \ at the clinic at around 11:30 that evening. Our daughter was with us under three\
    \ hours later. None of this fancy visionary stuff. I don't think she even laid\
    \ on the bed the whole time we were there; she just dropped the baby into the\
    \ midwife's arms as I massaged her shoulders.\r\n\r\nNot for everyone, but to\
    \ me...amazing.\r\n\r\n\r\nJason Conklin\t\r\njn.listserve@gmail.com\t\r\nHuntsville,\

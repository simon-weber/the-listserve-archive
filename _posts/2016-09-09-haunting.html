      <p>2 years ago I lived in a haunted house on McClellan Ave. with my sister Kylie,
      her boyfriend Mark and their corgi Finley. They were the perfect little family.
      <br />The house was a big 3 bedroom with creaky wooden floors and a long dark
      hallway. The 3rd bedroom had no door and was left unused. Everyday Finley would
      lay at the entrance and growl at nothing. The ceiling light in that room would
      always flicker. <br />I started sleeping with a nightlight.<br />The house was
      the only one on the block with no grass, it never grew despite how much Mark
      watered and seeded it.<br />He didn''t believe in ghosts, he said the dark stains
      that would appear and then vanish on the hardwood floors were water damage,
      that the black slugs and small grey flies that would come up from the drains
      were just an infestation, that the figure of a man he repeated saw in the kitchen
      was just his imagination. <br />Once when we were sitting at the small dining
      room table the 4th chair moved back without anyone touching it, like someone
      we couldn''t see had seated themselves for dinner. <br />I felt terrified being
      alone in the house. <br />Home alone one night the power went out and I was
      left staring at my own face in my vanity, lit up by my phone. I ran outside
      with Finley and sat under the street lamp, our house was the only one on the
      block with no lights on. <br />Taking a shower was a nightmare, the ceiling
      of the bathroom always had long black strands of hair stuck to it that I would
      have to brush away with a broom. <br />Once I heard a woman scream from inside
      my pillow. </p>

      <p>Eventually we moved out into a magnificent brightly lit house only a few
      blocks away on Oro Ave. It was beautiful with flower bushes and a green yard
      and I felt like Kylie and Mark had finally gotten the home they deserved. <br
      />I was scared to live alone but I saved money and got my own apartment. Mark
      moved all my furniture for me and bought me house warming presents. <br />3
      months ago Mark killed himself in the garage of the house on Oro Ave. <br />Do
      I think the house on McClellan had anything to do with it? No, of course not.<br
      />It doesn''t bother me to drive by the haunted house we used to live in and
      it doesn''t scare me to think about it, but I won''t drive past the house on
      Oro Ave. </p>

      <p>I am no longer afraid of ghosts, I''m afraid now of much more real things.

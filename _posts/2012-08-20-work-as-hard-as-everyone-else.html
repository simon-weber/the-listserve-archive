    One morning I was working for Rappaport and Haas, two older gentleman that had

    you studying in college?" as he swung his golf club lazily against the short grass.
    I replied, "Computer Science." Then Haas asked, "What do you want to do with your
    degree in Computer Science?" I answered, "I''m not really sure, but I know I want
    to be independently wealthy so I can play golf like you guys." Mr. Rappaport''s
    ears perked, he turned, pulled the cigar from his mouth, and interjected, "If

    as everyone else, and then work harder."  And I stood there in silence for he

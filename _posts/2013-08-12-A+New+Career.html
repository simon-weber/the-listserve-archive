<p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>I'm 40 years old and I was hoping someone could help me. I'm at a time in my life where I just don't know what to do. I wish to have a better job, a better paying job. But I was foolish and never went to college. I think I'd make a great nurse, but I can't afford to go back full time, and going at night would take about 6 or so years. </p>
<p>I make about $30,000 a year. It's an okay amount, but I can't take care of myself. What would happen if my husband got sick and no longer could work? What would happen if we divorced? </p>
<p>I push paper around. It's so boring. It's the same thing every day. </p>
<p>What are some positions I could look into that pay a bit more? I am now making an amount that I think is the most a company would be willing to pay me without additional schooling. </p>
<p>What are some careers I could learn in 2 years including prereqs? A 2 year program at night would probably be around 4 years... </p>
<p>I find that all the research I've done is misleading. I read I can become a nurse in 2 years... but then I read you must already have an associates degree. So then it's 4 years, which would take me 6 years or more to complete.</p>

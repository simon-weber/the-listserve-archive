      \ all with a Tibetan prayer for lovingness and kindness.\r\n\r\n\"May all beings\
      \ be peaceful. May all beings be happy.\r\nMay all beings be safe. May all beings\
      \ awaken to the light of their true nature.\r\nMay all beings be free.\"\r\n\
      \r\nI was once told, that I'm the guy who talks a lot about himself and the\
      \ shit I do, but the reality is not everyone wants to listen to you! As much\
      \ as I'd love to tell you the story of my life till now, I choose not to. Everyone\
      \ has a story that is unique and beautiful.\r\n\r\nA year back I was broken.\
      \ Today I'm fixed. (literally, since I ride fixies)\r\n\r\nMy advice to my fellow\
      \ Listservians, do what you want to do, live your life to the fullest and, if\
      \ you believe in something (good, cherish-able and peaceful), give it your heart\
      \ and soul till you achieve it, no compromises. Anything is possible, just believe\
      \ in yourself.\r\n\r\nYou can always write in to me at 3ennyj@gmail.com, and,\
      \ I'd love to share my 2 cents on the things I love the most, cycling, food,\
      \ fitness and travel.\r\n\r\nB\xD4M & Peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nBenny Paul Joseph\r\n\

    body: "With a cake. This is very easy, just follow this recipe:\r\nThe lava cake\
      \ recipe: (for 15-20 cupcake sized lava cakes)\r\n200g butter\r\n200g dark cooking\
      \ chocolate\r\n200g white sugar\r\n5 eggs\r\n1 tbs flour\r\nNutella\r\n\r\n\
      Preheat the oven at 375 F (190 C). (This is IMPORTANT! Never neglect to preheat\
      \ the oven.)\r\n\r\nMelt the chocolate with the butter, and then add the sugar.\r\
      \nAdd the eggs one by one, and beat the mixture very strongly after each egg\
      \ addition. The resulting mixture must be perfectly homogeneous. Add the flour\
      \ last. (Taste it: it should already taste amaaaaazing!)\r\n\r\nPour the mixture\
      \ in the cupcake cups; fill them up to 3/4.\r\n\r\nNow it's time to add the\
      \ Nutella, to transform this great recipe in an AMAZING Nutella melting heart\
      \ cake!\r\nI usually take two table spoons; I fill one with roughly 1/3 of Nutella\
      \ and use the second to drop the Nutella in the center of the cake. Once the\
      \ Nutella drop is in the cake I use one spoon to collect some dough on the side\
      \ to lightly cover the Nutella drop with some dough.\r\n\r\nNow it's time to\
      \ cook it 20 to 25 minutes at 375 F (190 C).\r\nHow to know when it's done:\
      \ First of all it smells delicious. Secondly you can use a knife and stick it\
      \ on the SIDE (NOT in the MIDDLE) of the cake, it should come out ALMOST dry\
      \ (yes, the \u201Calmost\u201D is very important: if it's too dry that means\
      \ it's too cooked, but if it's not enough that means it's not done yet). If\
      \ that can help you feel better: you will most likely fail the cooking the first\
      \ time. I did failed it a couple time before getting used to how the cake should\
      \ look like when it's done.\r\n\r\nAnd now enjoy your delicious cakes, and share\
      \ them! Good cakes are made to be shared!\r\n\r\n(Sure this recipe won\u2019\
      t buy you love for life, but it will do so for the next five minutes, so better\
      \ act quick if you have a favor to ask, or a bad news to announce.)\r\n\r\n\
      I will finish this email with a bunch of random thoughts:\r\n-My name is Aleth,\
      \ I am a 24 years old girl (I know: so not obvious from the name), I am French\
      \ and I moved to Boston in August to pursue a PhD in Chemistry.\r\n-This is\
      \ the first time in my life I\u2019ve ever, ever, EVER win anything. Hopefully\
      \ this is announcing the beginning of good times to come.\r\n-If you ever want\
      \ to watch a good French TV show because you like French or you want to learn\
      \ it, watch Spiral (French title is \u201CEngrenages\u201D). Season 4 is available\
      \ on Netflix, and there\u2019s plenty of ways to find the previous seasons (why\
      \ the hell are they not on Netflix too?! That\u2019s an amazing show!)\r\n-I\
      \ considered going all cheesy about the persons I love, but I figured you guys\
      \ don\u2019t care.\r\n-I am also always looking for good new fantasy books,\
      \ and indie bands. So I\u2019ll be happy to hear any suggestions. (Like literally\
      \ \u201Cany\u201D. I listen to a lot of different styles of music)\r\n-Let me\
      \ know how the recipe turned out if you try it. Or shoot me an email if you\
      \ want to talk about anything else, I always like a good story.\r\n-I\u2019\
      ll finish with a joke I actually find very accurate:\r\nWhat do you call somebody\
      \ who can speak 3 languages?\r\nTrilingual\r\n2 languages?\r\nBilingual\r\n\
      1 language?\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nAmerican\u2026!\r\n\r\n(Oh, and you lost the game.)\r\

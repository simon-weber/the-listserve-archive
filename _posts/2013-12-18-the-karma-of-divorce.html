      divorced dad and am now getting to see it from the other side.</p>

      <p><br />I have a better understanding now of some of what my parents went through.
      It had never occurred to me, for instance, that my dad once had to have a conversation
      with my stepmother where he explained how much money he made, and how much got
      taken off the top in child support. And on the other side, there was the time

      him everything!'' I had to gently explain to him that HE couldn''t be the one
      to do that!</p>

      <p><br />Here''s the thing: when kids are involved, you have to be the grown-up,
      and that sometimes means sucking it up. Sucking it up doesn''t mean staying
      married to someone you can''t be married to. But it does mean letting go of
      your own petty stuff in the service of a good life for your kid.</p>

      <p><br />Between my childhood with divorced parents, my adulthood as a stepmom,
      and my career as a teacher, I have seen it all, and I think most divorcing parents
      would do a better job if they spent less time thinking about how much they hate
      their ex and more time thinking about how much it would suck to be the kid in
      the middle of the whole thing---the kid who is told they can''t go to the family
      holiday party with dad because it''s not his weekend; the kid who can''t keep
      a picture of Mom''s new baby in his room because Dad doesn''t want to hear about
      it; the kid who can''t go the baseball game with Grandpa and the cousins because
      his other parent won''t drive a little out of their way to drop him off; the
      kid who misses an appointment because one parent won''t let the other one pick
      him up a few minutes before the official access time; the kid who is housebound
      for a weekend because Dad''s carseat broke suddenly and Mom won''t loan him
      hers for the weekend; the kid who spent 20 minutes crying on the front step
      of her school because yesterday''s parent didn''t tell today''s parent that
      the usual pickup route had some road construction going on which would make
      them be late...</p>

      <p><br />Please, divorcing parents, don''t be that person. Loan Dad the carseat.
      Tell him about the construction. Let the other parent swap weekends for a family
      party. Sign the consent form so they can take the child on a special trip. Let
      them have an extra hour so that an out-of-town relative can see the child during
      a visit. Don''t make your child a victim of your desire to be right, to win,

    \ that filled my days (and nights). The only empty spot in my schedule was Wednesday\
    \ from 6:30pm onwards. And there it was. On a Wednesday morning I saw a poster\
    \ with \"Want to study in Italy, Canada or Wales?\" written on it. \"Presentation\
    \ - Wednesday [that same day] at 7pm\". Coincidence? Destiny? Call it what you\

    \ in the middle of the rain forest, next to the ocean, along with 199 other students\
    \ from about 90 countries, having the opportunity to do things I would have never\
    \ done otherwise, meeting amazing people from all over the world, having seals\
    \ and sea lions as next door neighbours, kayaking every week, printing my own\
    \ photos in a dark room, having the most amazing conversations at insane hours\
    \ at night with my roommates from all over the world at the expense of very little\
    \ sleep (but at that age, who cares!), studying concepts of the theory of relativity\
    \ with friends by acting out (literally) thought experiments, having classes in\
    \ a floating building, teaching other students how to dance \"saya\", recording\

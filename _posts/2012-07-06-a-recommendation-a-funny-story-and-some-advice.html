<p>Hello World,<br />1.      If you&#146;re unfamiliar with Neil DeGrasse Tyson, please look him up. You will learn you are not only a part of the Universe, but ARE the Universe.<br />2.      A friend recently told me this was his favourite story. I spent my 20s working in a school for children with various special needs. Twice a year we would take some of them to an outdoor adventure centre where we would climb, tunnel, drive quad-bikes etc. It was awesome. And very dirty. Hence we would shower the kids every night.<br />One boy I worked with, who was about 8, had various digestive medical conditions that resulted in him wearing a nappy and often suffering discomfort. At the end of one day he was in a toilet cubicle both undressing for his shower and using the facilities. Suddenly he called out to me, in a lot of distress, that his bottom was stinging (This is not the funny part!). I hurried him into the shower and rinsed him down with water relieving him of his agony. He was very thankful and continued to shower as normal.<br />Many weeks later, I was helping out in his classroom when out of the blue, he said to me &#147;Do you remember when you were in the shower with me and I was crying because my bottom hurt?&#148;<br />3.      Don&#146;t feel bad that you don&#146;t know what you&#146;re doing sometimes. No one does. We are all making it up as we go.</p>

      Far more of our public space is tied up in roads and sidewalks than parks. And\
      \ far more than the privileged do, the underserved need these facilities to\
      \ access opportunities - jobs, services, family, care. When you are thinking\
      \ about how your community does or should use these facilities think about whether\
      \ your transportation is serving the most possible people or serving the best\
      \ possible public use. Does that system that encourages 5 seater cars that contain\
      \ only one person (or worse yet, 0 people while sitting idle 95% of the day)\
      \ really make sense? Is it really using our public space efficiently and equitably\
      \ or is it prioritizing the rich, the able bodied, the people who have the most?\
      \ \r\n\r\nFor more on the subject, check out the amazing Tamika Butler who does\

      <p>A brief on me: I''m a 35 year old half Mexican, half Filipino non-profit

      election for many reasons. Even if you don''t live in a swing state and you
      don''t think your presidential selection will matter, you can almost certainly
      influence a local election or ballot initiative. Political governance is complicated,

      <p>2.) Our streets are our public space, and they belong to everyone.<br />Far
      more of our public space is tied up in roads and sidewalks than parks. And far
      more than the privileged do, the underserved need these facilities to access

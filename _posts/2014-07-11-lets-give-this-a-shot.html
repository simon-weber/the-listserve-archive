      s move on to a story. In the fall of 2009, a group I was involved in during\
      \ college came into possession of a 3 piece pink tuxedo for a breast cancer\
      \ fashion show. After that show, we had no idea what to do with this item we\
      \ had purchased. In January 2010, I came across info for a breast cancer 5k\
      \ in town, and decided if I trained properly, I could run the 5k in the pink\
      \ suit. So I bought the suit from the group, trained, and ran in the 5k that\
      \ year. I\u2019ve run that race in the pink suit for the past 5 years now, and\
      \ after some chance encounters this past January, I now sit on the Board of\
      \ Directors for that non-profit\u2019s affiliate in Tucson.\r\n\r\nMy lesson\
      \ from that experience was that you never know what\u2019s going to come from\
      \ any conversation at any time, so always be ready. I\u2019ve had more opportunities\
      \ fall in my lap from starting a conversation with someone than from actually\
      \ applying for anything.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve also run a couple half marathons in\
      \ a business suit and frequent mud runs in one as well. I\u2019ve never really\
      \ felt like a normal runner. I\u2019m not doing it for health. I\u2019m not\
      \ doing it for a PR. I don\u2019t have groups I run with. I just love being\
      \ the spectacle. I know I\u2019m capable of running the race, but I also know\
      \ I\u2019m capable of doing it while wearing something that will entertain others\
      \ that are running, so why wouldn\u2019t I?\r\n\r\nHow about some recommendations\
      \ and a random thought to finish it?\r\n\r\nBoard Games: Twilight Imperium 3,\

      <p>Here''s the best answer I''ve found so far. Apologies to Thich Nhat Hanh,

      <p>The ocean is full of waves that go up and go down. Some are towering and

      it becomes water again...which it always was.</p>

      <p>The beginning and end of a wave are like a person&#8217;s birth and death.
      We are ourselves, and we are also made up of everything else: other people,
      the earth, plants, sun, the sky, and all the elements. We are and have always
      been inseparable. And we begin, and ultimately, we die. And when we die we become
      what we have always been: everything else.</p>

      <p>And while we celebrate the birth of a wave (so exciting to see one coming!),
      we don''t mourn its death. Because we know that wave is the water, and the water
      still lives, and will live for longer than we can imagine. &#160;</p>

      <p>We''re like the waves. We&#8217;re born and we die, and at the same time
      we''re not born and we don''t die.</p>

      <p>That&#8217;s it. Reach out anytime! Always happy to meet fellow "waves" on
      this trip across the ocean. Especially if those waves like road biking, craft
      beer, and video games. :)</p>

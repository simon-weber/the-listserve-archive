      <p>No pressure.</p>

      <p>I am passionate about learning. I think the mind is a muscle that requires
      exercise in order to be healthy and strong. My father lived to 88 and enjoyed
      nearly 30 years of retirement, largely, I feel, due to his insatiable curiosity
      and desire to learn new things.</p>

      <p>Four years ago as an adult I started playing the cello. It&#8217;s a surprisingly
      difficult instrument to learn to play well. And music is endlessly complex,
      with layer upon layer of nuance and meaning to ferret out and understand.</p>

      <p>I have what I call an &#8220;infinite list&#8221;. This is the ever growing
      list of things I wish to learn or experience. The content of the list is less
      important, I feel, that having it and having the desire and drive to keep tackling
      new topics and new experiences.</p>

      <p>Age is a state of mind and as long as your mind is young and supple I think
      you can be ageless &#8212; at least to some extent.</p>

      <p>What&#8217;s on your infinite list?</p>

<p class="meta">October 28 2013</p>

<p>600 or fewer non-controversial, non-self-promoting words that 20,000 plus people will see in less than 48 hours.</p>
<p>No pressure.</p>
<p>I am passionate about learning. I think the mind is a muscle that requires exercise in order to be healthy and strong. My father lived to 88 and enjoyed nearly 30 years of retirement, largely, I feel, due to his insatiable curiosity and desire to learn new things.</p>
<p>Four years ago as an adult I started playing the cello. It&#8217;s a surprisingly difficult instrument to learn to play well. And music is endlessly complex, with layer upon layer of nuance and meaning to ferret out and understand.</p>
<p>I have what I call an &#8220;infinite list&#8221;. This is the ever growing list of things I wish to learn or experience. The content of the list is less important, I feel, that having it and having the desire and drive to keep tackling new topics and new experiences.</p>
<p>Age is a state of mind and as long as your mind is young and supple I think you can be ageless &#8212; at least to some extent.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s on your infinite list?</p>

    \ takes the joey out and licks its butt so it poops outside the pouch.  Actually\
    \ true.\r\n\r\nAnyways, now that I\u2019ve got your attention, I\u2019m Brian\
    \ and I\u2019m full of useless knowledge. Sadly, this trove of odd conversation\
    \ starters (or enders) has never scored me a free pitcher or pint at a local trivia\
    \ night.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve had a manic start this year, so instead of getting all\
    \ downer with you guys, I\u2019d like to share a story that makes me giggle. Looking\
    \ back, this tale technically could be considered my first foray into marketing!\r\
    \n\r\n \"The Time Dazzle Got a Lot of Solicitous Phone Calls:\"\r\n\r\nIt was\
    \ about 3am on a school night, and I was living at 2209 Van Ness. A grand old\
    \ dame of San Francisco\u2019s \u201CGold Coast,\u201D it was bought by the Academy\
    \ of Art for student housing, which included myself.  This was probably a low\
    \ point in the poor domicile\u2019s existence. There was total irreverence to\
    \ the architectural value (truly beautiful) and much . . . what some could call\
    \ \u201Cextra curricular revelry.\u201D  But I digress.  It was my first semester,\
    \ and between a general lack of motivation for any core curriculum and a healthy\
    \ appetite for SF nightlife, I was still up applying gouache to an unfinished,\
    \ un-matted portrait of my buddy Dazzle. Why Dazzle? I don\u2019t know, he\u2019\
    s a cool dude and the picture I was basing it off of was over exposed so I didn\u2019\
    t have to work the contrast much.\r\n\r\nAnyways, here I am, punch drunk (probably\
    \ drunk), with a stack of posterized reference pictures, a black marker, and a\
    \ penchant to delay the inevitable all-nighter.  Now Dazzle had a thing for  -ahem-\
    \ ladies of a larger stature than his own shall we say?  So I took it upon myself\
    \ to find Dazzle a new date.  And I was intentionally broadcasting for love, in\
    \ all the wrong places.  The marker took my hand to paper like a hawk to prey,\
    \ furiously creating quips upon my reference materials.   Here are some examples:\r\
    \n\r\n 1.)\u201CI\u2019ve got an average size (crude drawing of genitalia) \u201C\
    -Pic- \u201CFor a decent time, call Dazzle at (415) ***-****\u201D\r\n\r\n 2.)\u201C\
    Dazzle loves meatballs\u201D \u2013Pic- \u201CLet him taste yours! (415) ***-****\u201D\
    \r\n\r\n 3.)\u201CNeed something to hold onto?\u201D  -Pic- \u201CDazzle\u2019\
    s here for you (415) ***-****\u201D\r\n\r\n 4.) \u201CDazzle Loves Surprises\u201D\
    \ \u2013Pic- \u201CCall me (415) ***-****\u201D\r\n\r\nThe rest escape me.  The\
    \ true joy was in the execution.  Cue partner in crime Bo, who hit the streets\
    \ with me post-portrait, allowing it time to fully dry. We must\u2019ve had about\
    \ 25 of these \u201Cflyers,\u201D so to establish a mass distribution channel\
    \ we decided the SF Muni would disseminate the message with greater efficacy.\
    \  To the bus stops it was, to wait for the 43, slap Dazzle\u2019s face on there,\
    \ and run laughing like a little girl.  It didn\u2019t stop there.  Public bathrooms,\
    \ bus stops for the impatient to gawk, Subway\xAE, etc.\r\n\r\nNow jump a few\
    \ hours to when I got a call from Dazzle. He was walking to class and wasn\u2019\
    t amused as he past, and futilely tried to rip down, every poster he saw. Poor\
    \ Dazzle, he had no idea about our distribution channel, or that we entered any\
    \ place that was open around 6am and plastered him in every bathroom stall.\r\n\
    \r\n \tDazzle got phone calls for months from these antics, but no dates unfortunately.\
    \  The voicemails were absurd though.  Truly works of art.\r\n\r\n \tHe didn\u2019\
    t get a date, but I\u2019m pleased to say that he\u2019s now happily married.\r\
    \n\r\nSo stop calling.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nBrian\r\nbrian@bvoynick.com\t\r\

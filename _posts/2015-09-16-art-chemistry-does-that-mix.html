      \ I eventually had to choose a study, I totally freaked out. Because I loved\
      \ sciences, but I also liked history and also worked at a cultural youth organization\
      \ where I organized all kinds of cultural events, for example a 'poetry palooza'\
      \ (see urban dictionary for the exact meaning of 'palooza'). \r\n\r\nEventually\
      \ I decided I wanted to study chemistry, for all kinds of reasons I won't bore\
      \ you with. Not long after that decision I found, by accident, a Master's that\
      \ got my attention:\r\n\r\n\"Conservation and Restoration of Cultural Heritage\"\
      \r\n\r\nThis would mean I'd get to restore art! This way I could combine my\
      \ love for science and art! I don't know how much you know about Amsterdam.\
      \ But there's one museum that almost always has a line.. Het Rijksmuseum. This\
      \ is where the Night Watch by Rembrandt is exhibited. The Master's is a collaboration\
      \ between the university and this amazing museum! \r\n\r\nNow why am I telling\
      \ you all this? These are my reasons:\r\n\r\n- I never thought of restoration\
      \ of art when I thought of chemistry and this shows that when you choose a study\
      \ or a job, it never has to mean you can't do something totally different with\
      \ that study or after that job. \r\n- If anyone has articles, information or\
      \ anything else on this topic I would love to receive that. My e-mail is tula.kaptein@gmail.com,\
      \ I'd love to hear from you!\r\n- Also anything else on the topic of art or\
      \ chemistry you think I should see or read is welcome!\r\n- I also want to encourage\
      \ people who have to make an important choice right now or in the foreseeable\
      \ future, because I'm the worst when it comes to making these kind of choices,\

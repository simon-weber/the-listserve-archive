<p>How often do you listen to music? I mean, really listen? I could go on about actual scientific studies that link music to a whole host of physical and psychological benefits, but rather than rattle on here, try it.</p>
<p>A musician myself, I&#8217;ve played the piano for about half my life. I don&#8217;t profess to be any good, in fact I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m rather rubbish (though my friends &amp; fans would likely say otherwise). In the beginning, I would do everything by rote. Always playing from sheet music, never improvising, and not truly understanding the underlying logic of what I was playing. It was not until I shipped off to college sans my mammoth sheet music collection that I first forced myself to try to play from memory &#8211; I recall repeatedly enthusing myself with the crashing  I-V-IV progression of The Who&#8217;s Baba O&#8217;Riley and feeling better than I ever did playing Chopin.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve since found that by simply listening to music on a regular basis, I&#8217;ve become a better musician, and my life has improved too. I started writing my own tunes, and running regularly listening to music, getting into the best shape of my life. I put together a band called The Medicine (music is medicine, after all) and have a whole bunch of material that you can find under my own name (or username brtnlewis) on SoundCloud. I&#8217;d appreciate your feedback on my own creations, and any thoughts or musings on any of this stuff in general.</p>

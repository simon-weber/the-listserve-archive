    body: "This year I resolved to read 30 books. In high school I was an admirable\
      \ student, in college less so. But my teachers and classmates always regarded\
      \ me as bright. As a young person I read a lot, but I\u2019ve changed since\
      \ then. When I was young I was awkward, academic, bookish, and unhappy. As an\
      \ adult I'm at ease, and I'm grateful for that. I'm successful, sociable, carefree,\
      \ and content. But as a consequence of that my habits have changed. I spend\
      \ less time reading and more time gratifying. Last year I realized I missed\
      \ the satisfaction, seclusion, and contentment of reading, and I've come to\
      \ I dislike how I squander spare time. When I started on my 30-book goal my\
      \ concentration waned while reading. My mind easily wandered. I become distracted,\
      \ aloof, detached, and I had to wretch myself back into focus.\r\n\r\nI thought\
      \ 30 books was a solid, achievable goal--neither modest nor ambitious. More\
      \ than half the year has passed, and at 14 books I'm behind schedule. Not discouraged,\
      \ I logged into Goodreads--which I hadn't used since 2010--to track my progress.\
      \ I discovered that the friends I admire the most for their smarts have read\
      \ vast volumes beyond me. In numbers:\r\nMe = 185\r\nFriend #1: 420\r\nParticularly\
      \ lofty friend #2: 582 (I'll concede that's she was English major, but nonetheless)\r\
      \nAbysmal. Wonton internet vagrancy, and an excessive creativity at otherwise\
      \ wasting time--puzzle games, iPhone apps, and the like--built up over 10 years\
      \ and led to an enormous gap in learning. Thankfully, regular reading has brought\
      \ my focus back; my mind no longer strays while reading. In part this is because\
      \ I don't view reading as an activity that I can only do after the to-do list\
      \ is complete, the house is clean, and I've found a quiet corner providing perfect\
      \ solitude sipping a cup of chamomile tea. I now read \"sloppy\". I go from\
      \ distracted internet user to reading for 10 minutes and back again. I read\
      \ at airports, TVs blaring, and disgruntled conversations with customer service\
      \ taking place around me. I live a sloppy life--most of us do--and the idea\
      \ that reading takes place in the silence of a wood-paneled library doesn't\
      \ work anymore.\r\n\r\nDespite these gains, I also suffer from being a slow\
      \ reader, horribly slow in fact. At the beginning of the year I clocked in at\
      \ 250 words a minute. Since then I've quickened to 300 words a minute. (I deserve\
      \ a medal.) That slow pace hasn't change since I was young. I read slowly then,\
      \ and accepted it because it allowed me to fully absorb and experience the nuance\
      \ of what I was reading, or so I justified.\r\n\r\nBut now, instead of politely\
      \ accepting my sluggish pace and sticking my nose firmly back in a book, I can\
      \ waste time taking speed reading tests to confirm my lack of progress, and\
      \ sink further in a hole of hopelessness as I read that the average executive\
      \ reads 750 words a minute. There go my C-suite dreams. I realized I read slowly\
      \ when I started dating my husband. He'd zip through a plaque or travel guide\
      \ at an alarming pace. I'd have a paragraph left, and he was already making\
      \ travel plans. I assuaged my deficit by telling myself that while he reads\
      \ fantasy books at breakneck speed I was pursuing serious, sturdy tomes of great\
      \ literature: Lolita, Brideshead Revisited, and a particularly weighty autobiography\
      \ Caravaggio: A Life Sacred and Profane. (Again, medal-worthy)\r\n\r\nMy husband\
      \ kindly indulges me. Seeing how much my slow pace upsets me he quickly offers\
      \ that I retain more. (I don't.) I want to improve at this. I don't particularly\
      \ know why. Surfing the internet--distracting myself with nothing--prevents\
      \ me from having and attaining goals. I like setting out and achieving something,\
      \ however small. And after dabbling in other pursuits I know I won't be an internet\
      \ sensation, reality star, or otherwise stumble into an easily earned pile of\
      \ cash. Monetary ambitions disregarded, I still want to better myself. Empty\
      \ uses of time distract me, and make me unhappy from struggles that don't exist.\r\
      \n\r\nDo I dare set a goal to catch up to Ms. Total Count 582? 582 is a person\
      \ I really admire. She's horribly clever, has an irradiate sense of humor, and\
      \ a seemingly endless talent for retention and reference. I want to read more\
      \ because I want to provide more. I find it gratifying to have something to\
      \ contribute. Can I catch up to her? Hardly. Can I keep pace? Her reading goal\
      \ for the year is 50 books, which I (almost regrettably) also discovered on\
      \ Goodreads. She, of course, is entirely on track.\r\n\r\nEmily Smith\r\ne.egansmith@gmail.com\r\

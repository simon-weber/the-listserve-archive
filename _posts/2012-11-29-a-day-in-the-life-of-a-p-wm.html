      \ by. I pass it without a second look. It passes me without a look at all.\r\
      \n\r\nStomach grumbling, I duck into a convenience store. I linger in the store,\
      \ eyes closed shut from the cold. The cashiers are alert but their eyes are\
      \ directed elsewhere, downward in trajectory.\r\n\r\nI make it to my friend\u2019\
      s house, feeling the warmth of the lobby blast into my pores. I\u2019m free\
      \ at last from the frigid night air. Hopping onto the elevator, I see a stranger.\
      \ We exchange polite smiles. She\u2019s relaxed. The only thing I can think\
      \ about is the beauty of the warmth.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhite privilege. The idea of\
      \ it initially stung me. Because I\u2019m white I have some sort of advantage?\
      \ I didn\u2019t ask for this gain. Yet that\u2019s no excuse to ignore the benefits\
      \ of being a (Privileged) White Male:\r\n\r\nI walk down streets alone without\
      \ cops even glancing at me.\r\n\r\nI enter stores and the cashiers aren\u2019\
      t suspicious of me.\r\n\r\nI share confined spaces with others and they aren\u2019\
      t scared to interact with me.\r\n\r\nAt this moment in my life I am at the beginning\
      \ of what I know will be a never ending journey to discover how my race, class,\
      \ sex, and sexuality define my position in society. While many of you have been\
      \ forced to contemplate these issues long before me for reasons I will never\
      \ truly comprehend, I urge you to continue to do so. Invite white males in this\
      \ conversation too, because without inclusive, intelligent discussion we will\
      \ continue to wallow in a system of injustices.\r\n\r\nSome of us will have\
      \ to step down from the high platforms we have been on for far too long so that\

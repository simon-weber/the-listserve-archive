      <p>It''s a fascinating way to think about breaking into an industry - if successful
      people want to meet you, then you''re doing something interesting. Said another
      way, instead of struggling your way up the industry ladder, you should start
      building your own ladder until people notice. </p>

      <p>As I start to pursue filmmaking full-time next month, I want to hear stories

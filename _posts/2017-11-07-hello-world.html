      \ Canadian by nationality and spirit. Europe was my home, however, for almost\
      \ 8 1/2 years. I'm married to my very best friend, a good looking, hard-working\
      \ man with a generous soul. I started using Twitter on a regular basis around\
      \ January 20, 2017.  I like reading short stories (shout out to Alice Munro!),\

      \ to Morocco, Zanzibar and Pompeii. I never read the sports pages, I'm a little\
      \ bit clumsy, lousy at computer programming and, don't know how to drive a standard\
      \ (but would like to learn one day for no other reason than to prove that I\
      \ can master the art of the stick shift). I started a meditation series on Time\
      \ Management three days ago and oddly I am already reaping some of the benefits\
      \ of this course (NOTE TO SELF: STOP MULTI-TASKING). One of my all-time favourite\

      \ (please don't hate me) intrigued by the idea of having a daily read, on my\
      \ commute home from work, of the unfiltered thoughts from individuals from far\
      \ and wide. People I would likely never cross paths with let alone exchange\
      \ emails. And so here I am writing to you.\r\n\r\nNote: Hopefully you will have\
      \ an opportunity to actually read my email. I was so shocked to see that I won\
      \ today's email lottery that I accidentally unsubscribed to Listserve and had\
      \ to re-subscribe.\r\n\r\nAnyway, many thoughts swirled through my head upon\
      \ learning that today the Listserve forum would be mine. What is it that I really\
      \ want to share I asked myself? What do I wish to say? What dreams do I have\
      \ that perhaps readers can help make come true? What questions in my life would\
      \ I would like to see answered?\r\n\r\nShould I seek help in solving the mystery\
      \ of my father's disappearance and the whereabouts of his final resting place?\
      \ Do I use this once-in-a-lifetime chance to showcase some of the (bad) poetry\
      \ that I wrote in my \"bohemian\" days in the 80s?  Do I write about my younger\
      \ brother's inspiring partner who is putting up a spirited fight against cancer?\
      \ Should I write instead about my beloved maternal grandmother, a woman of great\
      \ wisdom with an unparalleled sense of humour, who passed away at 105 years\
      \ of age? Or should I just keep it simple and ask Listserve readers to practice\
      \ random acts of kindness like never before?\r\n\r\nUltimately, I decided that\
      \ I wanted to share this good fortune with my husband and asked him if he had\
      \ anything he would like to share or say. He thought about it for a while then\

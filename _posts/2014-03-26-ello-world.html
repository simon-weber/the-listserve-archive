      \ University of Rochester. I dislike the long emails just like the rest of you\
      \ so I\u2019m going to make a quick list of things that pop into my head:\r\n\
      \r\n* Being nice is super important. I\u2019m trying to get better about this.\r\
      \n\r\n* Appreciate your parents if they\u2019re still around. Mine are really\
      \ awesome people and sometimes I don\u2019t think I do this enough.\r\n\r\n\
      * There\u2019s someone out there named Krisi Hinova who is like the girl version\
      \ of me, except she\u2019s way better/cooler. Maybe three years of dating her\
      \ has me biased, though. If you know of her *definitely* say hi to her.\r\n\r\
      \n* Tip of the virtual hat to everyone in NYC. I love that city and can\u2019\
      t wait to join you all in the best place on the globe after I graduate college\
      \ :).\r\n\r\n* hackNY changed my life. If you\u2019re a student that likes programming,\
      \ look it up. Cheers to all my fellow fellows: you are some of the most interesting\
      \ people I\u2019ve ever met.\r\n\r\n* Shoutout to Simon Weber for showing me\
      \ the listserve. Look up \u201Cthe listserve archive\u201D \u2013 he\u2019s\
      \ the mind behind that rad site. He also introduced me to hacker school which\
      \ I really really want to do after college (hello hacker schoolers!).\r\n\r\n\
      That\u2019s all I\u2019ve got for you. I hope every one of you has an amazing\

      \nRochester, NY\r\n\r\nP.S. I love meeting new people. Send me an email and\
      \ say hello if you like programming, rock climbing, drumming, cooking, or new\

<p>Everyone has advice to give, mine is this: Do what makes your life happy, even if its just 5 minutes a day.</p>
<p>And to support that cause, I want to pass along a story that my wife has written. 600 words isn&#8217;t much, so here is half a story - email me back and I will send along the rest of it! She is working on a book and has other stories already published.</p>
<p>The Clean Fiend</p>
<p><br />&#8220;Go on, Ted, just try a bite. It&#8217;s not going to kill you. I mean, come on, you&#8217;re already dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, I just can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s so&#8230;unhygienic. We don&#8217;t even know where that has been. Just think of all the slimy, unsanitary cesspools in this city. Besides, you&#8217;re touching it and I know for a fact that you haven&#8217;t washed your hands in over a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My hands are mostly bone and tendon at this point. What&#8217;s to wash?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See, thinking like that just aids in the spread of unsavory diseases. Here, I have an antibacterial spray&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Ted. Just&#8230;no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Honestly, I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;re so resistant to the idea of basic hygiene. I can only imagine the number of creepy bacterium living inside of you right now. It&#8217;s just, ugh, it&#8217;s just too vile to contemplate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t point that at me!&#8221;</p>
<p> &#8220;Just let me spritz you on this bit of entrail at least. It can&#8217;t be healthy for it to just drag along the ground like that. Or, actually, wait, I think I have some plastic wrap that&#8217;ll-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ted! Stop it. Jesus! First off, that&#8217;s horribly invasive. Leave my intestines alone. Secondly, it&#8217;s the style, you know. Everyone&#8217;s doing it. It helps trip up the fleshies and, you know, it looks cool. Eva digs it. At least, I think she does. She lost her jaw the other week so it&#8217;s hard for her to talk now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really? Eva? The waitress from Bodie&#8217;s Buffet on 3rd?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The one and only, man. The one and only.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you weren&#8217;t her type? Because I distinctly remember you asking her out when we went there on New Years before all of this started and she said-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what she said, Ted! But she&#8217;s gotten to know me now. We&#8217;ve been seeing each other pretty steadily over at Bodie&#8217;s. He&#8217;s still serving up the buffet. Well, the menu has changed a bit, but you know&#8230; Stop looking at me like that, man! She&#8217;s totally into me. I can tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and I&#8217;m sure this has nothing to do with the fact that personal standards might lessen with advanced decomposition.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That kind of tone is totally unnecessary, dude. I&#8217;m just trying to&#8230; Okay, look, this isn&#8217;t about me! This is about your completely neurotic refusal to eat and all of this weirdo germ phobia crap. I mean, what self-respecting zombie carries around a fanny pack of sanitized baby wipes? I mean, seriously!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, I have a legitimate concern. If more people were conscientious about the spread of bacteria none of this would have happened in the first place. And by &#8216;people&#8217;, I mean you! I still remember waking up to you chewing on my leg. That was definitely a violation of trust!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, come on, Ted. How many times do I have to apologize for that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many&#8230;How many times do you have to apologize for turning me into the rotting undead? Do you seriously have to ask that?&#8221;</p>

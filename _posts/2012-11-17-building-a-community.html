  body: "Hello, everyone!\r\n\r\nI am the founder and owner of the startup 42Kmi.\
    \ My company develops products to enhance the competitive gaming experience, and\
    \ we have a website dedicated to nurturing the community and incubating talents\
    \ and hobbies in the areas of games, music, art, and design. I would like share\
    \ a short story with you.\r\n\r\n\r\n            The day was beautiful. The sky\
    \ was clear with few clouds accenting the ever extending blue. The sun was warm\
    \ like a loving embrace. A light breeze gaily danced around anything in its paths.\
    \ And the mid-morning hour had an afternoon air about it. The day seemed like\
    \ it could last forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n            On this day, a mother took her\
    \ two young sons to the market. She planned on buying lots of food and other things\
    \ for the house, and she needed the help. The twin brothers, Gaius, the older\
    \ brother, and Marcus, the younger brother, both loved visiting the market. The\
    \ hustle and bustle of the market was always more active and exciting than their\
    \ neat and orderly home environment. The structures and rules of their home hindered\
    \ the brothers\u2019 imagination, and Mother doesn\u2019t usually ask the boys\
    \ to accompany her to the market.\r\n\r\n            \u201CGaius, Marcus, we need\
    \ to buy some more fabrics as well!\u201D\r\n\r\n            \u201COkay!\u201D\
    \ the boys chimed, with their eyes barely peeking over the layers of bread and\
    \ cloths stacked in their arms. Marcus and Gaius began to talk among themselves\
    \ of fun and exciting thing they would soon see.\r\n\r\n            \u201CLivia!\
    \ Livia!\u201D a woman in the distance yelled. She was addressing the brothers\u2019\
    \ mother. It was an old friend of Mother\u2019s whom the boys had never met, but\
    \ from seeing how their mother acts around her usual acquaintances, they knew\
    \ how it would play out.\r\n\r\n            \u201CBoys, you two wait here. Your\
    \ mother is going to talk to a friend.\u201D Mother said. She then placed her\
    \ basket of rolls on the dirt ground for the boys to watch before scurrying over\
    \ to her friend.\r\n\r\n            \u201CAhh! They\u2019re gonna talk forever!\u201D\
    \ All day about this and that!\u201D a frustrated Gaius exclaimed. Marcus dropped\
    \ the linens he was carrying and took his seat on them.\r\n\r\n            \u201C\
    Yeah,\u201D Marcus added, \u201CGossip, gossip, gossip.\u201D\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    \            Some time passed as the brothers waited for their mother to return.\
    \ Gaius stood with his head down, eyes closed, and his arms folded. Marcus scribbled\
    \ in the dirt with a stick he found. The stick was about arms-length.\r\n\r\n\
    \            \u201CAhh! They\u2019re still talking! And there\u2019s more of them!\u201D\
    \ screamed Gaius after looking over to see his mother. There were more of them.\
    \ The women had flocked together like hens pecking the same kernel of corn, squawking\
    \ and quieting as each took her turn talking to then listening to another. As\
    \ the brothers waited, Gaius\u2019s impatience grew. There was so much he and\
    \ Marcus wanted to see. Marcus was still playing in the dirt, preoccupied with\
    \ the stick.\r\n\r\n            Then, a thought came to Gaius. \u201CThis could\
    \ be fun.\u201D he thought out loud.\r\n\r\n            \u201CHuh?\u201D Marcus\
    \ looked up from his dirt and saliva creations only to be welcomed by what seemed\
    \ like a zephyr of dirt.\r\n\r\n            \u201CGaius! What was that for?!\u201D\
    \ a flustered Marcus coughed, demanding an answer as he stood up. The once friendly\
    \ dirt now violently burned in his eyes. Gaius ran to another area, giggling.\r\
    \n\r\n            \u201CCome at me!\u201D Gaius taunted, struggling to keep a\
    \ straight face, \u201CCome at me and put on a vicious face!\u201D Marcus was\
    \ angered. He knew it was Gaius who kicked the dirt in his face. He couldn\u2019\
    t figure why, but he knew he wanted to get him back.\r\n\r\n            \u201C\
    Brother! You wear your most vicious face!\u201D yelled Marcus, pointing his stick\
    \ at his brother. Marcus could hear Gaius fighting laughter as he took flight.\
    \ He ran, chasing Gaius around the market. Gaius enjoyed his run, catching only\
    \ brief glimpses of some of the things he wanted to see. Marcus wanted Gaius.\
    \ Nothing else. They rushed past a pottery stand, almost toppling its wares. The\
    \ stand\u2019s artisan railed at the boys, but his voice caught neither brothers\u2019\
    \ ears. Gaius focused on outrunning Marcus. Marcus focused on catching Gaius.\
    \ The brothers continued running, dodging other patrons, ducking behind stands,\
    \ and diving under tables.\r\n\r\n            \u201CI think I lost him.\u201D\
    \ Gaius thought. Marcus was nowhere to be found. In his view, Gaius saw the most\
    \ beautiful linens. \u201CHe won\u2019t find me there.\u201D He thought the sheets\
    \ whispering with the wind provided the perfect cover. Without hesitation, he\
    \ darted for the sheets faster than he could. He felt dizzy, as if he just finished\
    \ a race and could take refuge in first place. But he could not stop until he\
    \ reached his linen sanctuary. As he came closer, the wind picked up, then billowed.\
    \ The sheets slightly rose from the ground, and Gaius could see somebody\u2019\
    s feet, with toes clenching the ground. He could not stop himself.\r\n\r\n   \
    \         \u201COh no!\u201D Gaius yelled, as if to warn the person of an unavoidable\
    \ accident, but the legs didn\u2019t move.\r\n\r\n            \u201CGot you!!\u201D\
    \ a familiar voice sounded. Before Gaius could recall the voice, a stick shot\
    \ out and gashed his left cheek. Gaius\u2019s eyes watched as the tip of the stick\
    \ entered his cheek, and his eyes watched as the stick flung blood out and onto\
    \ the brilliant sheets as it exited the wound. It was Marcus.\r\n\r\n        \
    \    With his thoughts collected, Gaius stopped. He examined the wound with his\
    \ right hand. His blood felt cool, then hot, and the wound was deep. With his\
    \ tongue, Gaius could feel the wound inside his mouth. The skin was thinner in\
    \ that area. His tongue could feel his fingers. This angered him, and with the\
    \ blood still fresh on his fingertips, Gaius charged and took his fist to his\
    \ brother\u2019s vicious face. He made contact. Now stained with Gaius\u2019s\
    \ blood, Marcus rose with the blood flicked linen. His grip on the stick loosened,\
    \ and Gaius felt the impact as his knuckles popped and cracked against his brother\u2019\
    s flesh. He could feel his nails enter the palm of his tightly clenched fist.\r\
    \n\r\n            Marcus landed and a cloud of dirt rose then fell. Dirt fell\
    \ on the blood his brother left on his face. Marcus whimpered. Tears welled. His\
    \ vicious expression was gone. Gaius, enveloped in rage, walked the distance his\
    \ brother\u2019s limp body traveled before settling. He squat down examining Marcus\
    \ and nursing his own wound.\r\n\r\n            \u201CBrother,\u201D Gaius began,\
    \ \u201CBe willing to strike vigorously. Vigorously to overcome!\u201D Gaius picked\
    \ himself up and saw Marcus\u2019s stick. The tip inked in his blood was now caked\
    \ with dirt. Gaius picked up the stick, the weapon forged against him. He examined\
    \ it, his cheek, and his brother. He turned from Marcus and walked away with the\
    \ stick in hand. Marcus lied where he lay in the linen sanctuary, surrounded by\
    \ the blood speckled sheets. \u201CBrother, you win, yet you failed,\u201D he\
    \ snickered aloud to himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Walking away, Gaius falls\
    \ to his knees. He soon begins to cry. He now realizes the depth of what has just\
    \ transpired. He can\u2019t help his tears. What he thought began as play quickly\
    \ became real, and blood, his own blood, was drawn. This feeling was too much\
    \ to bear. It choked him.\r\n\r\n            \u201CCurses!\u201D Gaius yelled\
    \ to the sky, pounding his fists to the ground, \u201CCurses to this day! Curses\
    \ to what it brought!\u201D His tears continue to flow before he picks himself\
    \ up. He continues walking, but the day\u2019s events keep replaying in his mind.\
    \ His walk becomes staggered and stuttered. Gaius slows his pace, and stops walking.\
    \ He closes his eyes and hurls the arms-length stick forward as hard as he could.\
    \ The stick spirals, traveling for a moment before a crash is heard. The sound\
    \ of shattered pottery. Gaius looks to the sky again, \u201CCurses to this too!\u201D\
    \ He runs in the direction of the shattered sound.\r\n\r\n            Among the\
    \ pottery shards, Gaius finds the stick. It\u2019s still about arms length, but\
    \ its tip is broken, and along with it Gaius discovered three strangely shaped,\
    \ beautifully colored rocks; a cardioid shape, a star shape, and a stone oddly\
    \ resembling a tomato.\r\n\r\n            \u201CWhat are these three?\u201D Gaius\
    \ asked himself. He reached for the rocks, wanting the day to be over.\r\n\r\n\
    \r\n            \u201CThey are mine, Gaius!\u201D It was Marcus. He wanted what\
    \ his brother held. He charged at his brother. Gaius could see the hate in his\
    \ eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n            \u201CMarcus, forgi-,\u201D before Gaius could\
    \ finish, Marcus pounced on him. They rolled and rumbled in the dirt. Gaius could\
    \ feel the dirt filling his wound. Marcus wanted to hurt Gaius. Gaius didn\u2019\
    t want to get hurt, and he didn\u2019t want to hurt Marcus again. The brothers\
    \ tumbled into many stands and bumped into many people. The struggle was great.\
    \ People watched as two boys fight and fought. No one cared to stop them. Soon\
    \ the brothers tumbled into a large group of women. A woman in the crowd quickly\
    \ looked as these vicious boys brushed against her leg.\r\n\r\n\r\n          \
    \  \u201CWhose children are these?!\u201D The boys froze in position. Gaius laid\
    \ on the ground, holding the stick, fending off Marcus, who held the stones in\
    \ his left and a raised fist in his right. The shrill voice of the nasal woman\
    \ snapped the boys, dirtied from a day of brawling, back to their senses.\r\n\r\
    \n\r\n            \u201CGaius! Marcus!\u201D Mother emerged from the crowd. \u201C\
    Why are you boys fighting?\u201D They couldn\u2019t answer. They had no answer.\
    \ The bothers managed to point at each other in an attempt to escape blame. Mother\
    \ saw what each brother was holding and saw that her sons were dirty.\r\n\r\n\r\
    \n            \u201CYour playing has gotten out of hand. You two are brothers.\
    \ You should behave and share like brothers.\u201D Mother apologized to the other\
    \ women and took her guilt stricken sons to collect the items they left behind\

    body: '<p>Hi there,</p>

      <p>First I was surprised that I won the listserve. Then the typical question
      hit me.<br />What should I do? Tell a story, try to teach something I learned,
      write about something that happened to me or to somebody else?</p>

      <p>I spent most of my time at work (handling product and fighting fires at my
      startup), some with the people I love and what is left reading (anything historical
      and philosophical) and cooking (mostly Asian fusion, always to share).</p>

      <p>I want to show you Five Thesis about the future.  Your world will change,
      as it always has. We should do our best to shape this change.</p>

      <p><br />1. Fixing the basics<br />Nobody should lack the basic necessities,
      nobody should face extreme poverty and hunger. No child should die by causes
      we can already fix. Many diseases can already be better controlled by simple
      tools.</p>

      <p>The millennium goals were aimed correctly. There are many initiatives trying
      to help, but change takes time.<br />Thankfully a lot of time was already spent
      on analyzing on what seems to create lasting change. Check out Poor Economics
      and try to get involved where you think you can make a change. It is often easier
      than you think.</p>

      <p><br />2. Making it easy to learn<br />It should be as easy, entertaining
      and relaxing to learn something as to binge watch the newest series on Netflix.<br
      />Education (in the broadest sense of learning, broadening your horizons and
      gaining new perspectives and tools) is the greatest leverage we have.</p>

      <p>A product I always wanted to build is a system that learns with me, recording
      what I read and learn and helps me remember and reinforces lessons already learned.
      Perhaps one of you is building something like this, if you are, reach out.</p>

      like never before. Crisis follows crisis, filter bubbles contract but never
      seem to pop. It is hard to find purpose in such a world.</p>

      <p>We need to make it easier for people to find such a purpose. May it be a

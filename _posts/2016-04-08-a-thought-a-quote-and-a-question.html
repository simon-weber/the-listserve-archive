    body: "Dear readers,\r\n\r\nI'd like to share with you a thought, a quote, and\
      \ a question.  Here goes:\r\n\r\nA THOUGHT:\r\nMost of the time when you go\
      \ to see a play there is only one stage. All of the events take place on that\
      \ one stage, before everyone's eyes.  Everyone is watching the same thing.\r\
      \n\r\nBut there is also a play called Tamara by John Krizanc, where actors are\
      \ spread out across 10 or 11 different rooms. They all perform at the same time.\
      \ The audience (rather than sitting down) walks through the different rooms\
      \ and sees different bits and pieces of the same production.  The result: No\
      \ two people see the exact same play.\r\n\r\nI think this is a good metaphor\
      \ for what happens in life too. The world, \"reality\", whatever you want to\
      \ call it - it takes place on a billion different stages and is constantly unfolding.\
      \ We don't have access to all stages. We can't possible watch all of them. Instead\
      \ we only see what happens right in front of us, in our own personalized series\
      \ of scenes. But that differs from person to person.  None of us can understand\
      \ the entire play because each of us sees a different version of the same massive\
      \ performance. So in that sense nobody's version of reality is truer than the\
      \ next, rather everyone's perception of reality is true to some extent, but\
      \ also... incomplete.\r\n\r\nSo the next time you think you know better than\
      \ the person you are talking to (and let's be honest, we all do), remember Tamara.\r\
      \n\r\nA QUOTE:\r\nI love quotes, and I think that this one by Aristotle ties\
      \ in nicely to Tamara and the thought above.\r\n\r\n\"It is the mark of an educated\
      \ mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.\"\r\n\r\nPretty\
      \ good, right?  It's easy to disagree with someone. But it's a real challenge\
      \ to try to understand someone you don't agree with.  That one is harder to\

    body: '<p>Dear readers,</p>

      <p>I''d like to share with you a thought, a quote, and a question.  Here goes:</p>

      <p>A THOUGHT:<br />Most of the time when you go to see a play there is only
      one stage. All of the events take place on that one stage, before everyone''s
      eyes.  Everyone is watching the same thing.</p>

      <p>But there is also a play called Tamara by John Krizanc, where actors are
      spread out across 10 or 11 different rooms. They all perform at the same time.
      The audience (rather than sitting down) walks through the different rooms and
      sees different bits and pieces of the same production.  The result: No two people
      see the exact same play.</p>

      <p>I think this is a good metaphor for what happens in life too. The world,
      "reality", whatever you want to call it - it takes place on a billion different
      stages and is constantly unfolding. We don''t have access to all stages. We
      can''t possible watch all of them. Instead we only see what happens right in
      front of us, in our own personalized series of scenes. But that differs from
      person to person.  None of us can understand the entire play because each of
      us sees a different version of the same massive performance. So in that sense
      nobody''s version of reality is truer than the next, rather everyone''s perception
      of reality is true to some extent, but also... incomplete.</p>

      <p>So the next time you think you know better than the person you are talking
      to (and let''s be honest, we all do), remember Tamara.</p>

      <p>A QUOTE:<br />I love quotes, and I think that this one by Aristotle ties
      in nicely to Tamara and the thought above.</p>

      <p>"It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without
      accepting it."</p>

      <p>Pretty good, right?  It''s easy to disagree with someone. But it''s a real
      challenge to try to understand someone you don''t agree with.  That one is harder
      to do.  I think Aristotle''s quote is just as relevant today as it was 2,300
      years ago when he first wrote it. Although at that time it probably looked more
      like this:</p>

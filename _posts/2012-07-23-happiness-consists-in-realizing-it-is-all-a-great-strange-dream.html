<p>In an age where we are constantly connected to everyone and everything, there's never been a bigger divide in social interactions, I feel that people are losing the ability to communicate properly. However, being a part of Listserve has reminded me that we can truly make a connection and communicate without the need to meet. Receiving these emails over the past months/weeks has inspired me to take risks, reevaluate my life and make it a life that I want to live not only that but I've had to chance to gain insight into some incredible and passionate people in this world. So thank you all for being you, never stop!</p>

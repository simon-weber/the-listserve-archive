      \ will eventually bring you happiness if you find it. What are you passionate\
      \ about? For me, the answer is music. I am a singer/songwriter and I play piano\
      \ (and I\u2019m currently learning drums). I am not receiving income for it\
      \ yet, but I plan to eventually make that a reality. In high school, I didn\u2019\
      t really know what it was I wanted to go into. My family drilled into my head\
      \ being a musician was not an option and that I needed to go to school for something\
      \ that made a lot of money. I listened because I didn\u2019t know any better\
      \ and went to school for Electrical Engineering.\r\nElectrical Engineering is\
      \ a tough college curriculum (even tougher when you\u2019re not passionate about\
      \ it). I put a lot of time into keeping my grades up and when I wasn\u2019t\
      \ in school, I was interning for a company in the auto industry. That resulted\
      \ in me not playing as much when I first started college. About half way through\
      \ my college career, music\u2019s call got too strong and I had to integrate\
      \ music back into my life. I did this by getting a minor in Music. It added\
      \ a semester to my time in college, but it was very much worth it.\r\n\r\nFast\
      \ forward to about 14 months after I graduated college. I\u2019m working as\
      \ an engineer for a company, but the job is very time intensive and does not\
      \ allow time for other things. I was stressed, overworked, and putting almost\
      \ all of my time into something that I really didn\u2019t care about. I came\
      \ to the conclusion that I would rather feel stressed and overworked about something\
      \ I\u2019m passionate about than something I don\u2019t care about at all. Because\
      \ of that, I\u2019m working on a plan to eventually quit my current job and\
      \ become a full-time musician (likely with a different job that allows me more\
      \ time when I first start off).\r\n\r\nNow we\u2019re at present day. Since\
      \ I decided I was going to become a musician, I have gone back to school for\
      \ mixing/mastering music, started taking piano and drum lessons, taken classes\
      \ about artist management and songwriting, and read multiple books regarding\
      \ songwriting. I even joined a choir. I did all these things at one time or\
      \ another while working and it is HARD! There are many late nights and Monster\
      \ in my life (I\u2019m actually writing this late in the night), but I have\
      \ never been happier. I\u2019m going to work my way towards my goal and achieve\
      \ it. When I do make the leap to become a musician, I know I\u2019ll be okay.\r\
      \n\r\nThe point I\u2019m trying to make is this: When you stray from your path,\
      \ you get weak. In a sense, I tried multiple times to ignore what it was I was\
      \ passionate about and I regretted it dearly each time. So if you can find what\
      \ you\u2019re passionate about and pursue it with everything you have, I guarantee\
      \ you will find a happiness and resolve in yourself you never knew was there.\r\
      \n\r\nIf you made it this far, thank you so much for taking the time to read\

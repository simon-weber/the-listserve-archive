    <p>It helps to put things in perspective. I think about my lucky breaks and near
    misses. When I was 12, two friends and I trespassed on private property to explore
    a cave, and an man standing in the field fired a shotgun at us. He was far enough
    away that the shot bounced off our skin. If he''d been closer we could have been
    injured or worse. </p>

    <p>In college I was walking at night with a friend and a car pulled up and the

    of his pistol and then ordered the driver to drive away. </p>

    <p>Another time I was driving with friends in my car in Boulder, Colorado. This
    was 1982 or so. It was two in the morning and the car was rattling with empty
    beer cans. As I drove, I wondered why the traffic lights were all out. A police

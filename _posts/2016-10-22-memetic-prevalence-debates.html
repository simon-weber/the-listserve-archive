    body: "Once upon a time there was a Sparrow who lived with her fellow sapient\
      \ animals in the woods outside of Fairbanks, Alaska. One day in October, it\
      \ started to get very cold, and Sparrow's friend Salamander died of hypothermia.\
      \ Sparrow was very sad about this, and said, \"This is an outrage! We need to\
      \ build a bonfire and keep it going throughout the winter, so that no more animals\
      \ will die of the cold!\"\" \r\n\r\nCaribou and Bison grumbled that this would\
      \ be a lot of extra unnecessary work; they'd survived many winters without a\
      \ bonfire, so why was one needed now? They told Sparrow to go away and leave\
      \ them alone. Sparrow, not to be deterred, started tweeting about her cause\
      \ with the hashtag #BonfiresForSalamander. Eventually she got retweeted by Kitty\
      \ Purry, which brought a lot more attention to her cause, and soon there was\
      \ a full-blown Bonfire Movement. Animals all around the world started pitching\
      \ in to help build bonfires. Before long, every animal in Fairbanks had a warm\
      \ place to go. \r\n\r\nSparrow was very happy about this, but she knew her job\
      \ wasn't finished. \"There are still too many places out in the wilderness where\
      \ animals aren't safe from the cold!\"\", she said to her 400,000 Twitter followers.\
      \ \"Last week, an entire family of frogs died near Yakutsk. We have to keep\

      \" \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, outside of Phoenix, Arizona, a Coyote woke up and noticed\

      Hey, what's going on?\"\" she asked Iguana and Gila Monster as they gathered\
      \ more dead brush to throw onto the bonfire. \"Why is there a bonfire outside\

      \ to keep the other animals safe from the cold. Haven't you read about it on\

      \ but the Bonfire Movement is really important. Cold weather is the worst crisis\

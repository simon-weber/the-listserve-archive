<p>ANTIMETABOLE<br />noun<br />1. In rhetoric, the repetition of words in successive clauses, but in transposed order.<br />(from Wikipedia)</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>    "[A]sk not what your country can do for you&#8212;ask what you can do for your country." ~JFK</p>
<p>    For single women in tech, the odds are good, but the goods are odd.</p>
<p>    I know what I like, and I like what I know.</p>
<p>    "In America you can always find party. In Soviet Russia, Party always find you!" ~Yakov Smirnoff</p>
<p>    "I'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy!"</p>
<p>Now some riddles:</p>
<p>    Q: What's the difference between a jeweler and a jailer?<br />    A: A jeweler sells watches; a jailer watches cells.</p>
<p>    Q: What's the difference between an epileptic oyster sheller and a nymphomaniac with the runs?<br />    Email me for the answer to this one, or if you think you've figured it out. I warn you, it's pretty rude.</p>
<p><br />Book recommendations!</p>
<p>If you want to discuss any of these please reach out to me! If you've read them before, or if you're trying to decide whether to read them, or if you read them through my recommendations, or if you have recommendations for me, I'd love to hear from you!</p>
<p>The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood by James Gleick -- Spans the history from man's first records, through Turing and Boole, up to the ubiquitousness of information on the web today, and even touches on quantum physics. Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson is an awesome historical fiction companion.<br />Godel, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter -- Recursion for recursion's sake.<br />Cosmos by Carl Sagan -- Perfect for thinking about our place in the universe as the inhabitants of a little blue dot of a planet.<br />Time Enough for Love by Robert Heinlein -- Fun stories, free love ideas, space cowboys.</p>
<p><br />Similarly for music:</p>
<p>Ys by Joanna Newsom -- Clever and impactful lyrics, meandering epic poetry.<br />The Lion's Roar by First Aid Kit -- Melodic Swedish folk duo. Sisters!<br />Music for Two by Bela Fleck and Edgar Meyer -- Virtuosic jazz banjo and string bass.<br />The Waiting Room by Lusine -- Beautiful ambient-ish electronic to groove to while working.<br />Moment Bends by Architecture in Helsinki -- Fun, poppy, dance-y. All of their albums are great.</p>
<p>If you think you might like to hear more music recommendations from me, I'm planning to be DJing on turntable.fm at 4PM (PST) this coming Thursday (and if it's a hit, maybe every Thursday). You can find my room by searching for "meely's tunes."</p>
<p><br />One thing I really enjoy is making stop motion shorts, usually with clay. If you have a cute idea for one, I can always use the inspiration to make a new one! I will send it to you :) And probably tweet it.</p>

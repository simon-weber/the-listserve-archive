      \ in our control which cups get more water than others. Now, if I was Pablo\

      \ there who's an artist, but also loves to make pasta, and they give equal time\
      \ to each of those interests. It's fair to say that second artist will be a\
      \ lesser artist than Pablo Picasso, since they're giving half the effort and\
      \ time to being an artist. Again, we have many cups that make up or lives, but\
      \ only so much water to put into each one of those cups.\r\n\r\nFast forward\

      \ a great artist or graphic designer, I am going to have to put a lot of my\
      \ water in that cup, which means taking water out of my other cups. I feel right\
      \ now that my cup for my dead-end internship is getting more water than my cup\
      \ of creating, learning, and bettering my art. And if I truly want to become\
      \ a great and talented graphic designer, what cups am I going to lose along\
      \ the way? And, will I be happy with all my cup in that one cup? Would I be\

      \ world that I love and inspire me, it's saddening to thing I can't be well\

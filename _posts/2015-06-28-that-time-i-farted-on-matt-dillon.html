      \ call in my mind, this bathroom must be a private, one person, leave me alone\
      \ kind of bathroom. So I go to the urinal and start doing my thing. At this\
      \ point I should mention the music was quite loud in there, playing the popular\
      \ hit of the time (probably It's Goin' Down or some such nonsense). Because\
      \ of the blaring music, I failed to hear Matt Dillon not respect the laws I\
      \ set in my mind about this being a private bathroom, entered and then stood\
      \ behind me waiting for the urinal. Unaware of my visitor, I let one rip, better\

      \ shmuck that did shmucky things. It really bums me out, I was really banking\

      <p>&#8220;Great. My face is getting red. Oh man...can they tell my face is getting
      red? I look so dumb...my face is bright red. What does this person think of
      me?  And now it&#8217;s getting worse. Does what I&#8217;m saying even make
      sense? My face is more red now. Why does this happen so much? Now I just feel

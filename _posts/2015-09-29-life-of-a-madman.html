    body: "I was born with a very severe case of club foot. Basically my foot went\

      \ almost 5'9\" and with no discernible limp. I never met my father. He and my\
      \ mother ended their engagement before she was aware she was pregnant with me.\
      \ I went through most of my life believing he was just my mother's coke dealer\
      \ and not much more. It wasn't until my 20's I found out that's just how they\
      \ met but later got engaged. I was lucky enough that she found a great husband\

      \ go to a school like that it broadened my horizons. When someone tries to use\

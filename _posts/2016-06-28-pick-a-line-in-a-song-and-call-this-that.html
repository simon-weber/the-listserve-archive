      \nOne of my big beliefs as a kid was that there was no such thing as a quiet\
      \ person, just a situation that made them quiet or where they could/would not\
      \ speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI challenge each any every one of you to go wild, to\
      \ talk to whoever, whenever for as long as you want saying anything and everything\
      \ that comes to mind without fear of judgement or consciousness of audience.\r\
      \n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow many of my generation right now have real, REAL friends? Not\
      \ a squad or a clique, but someone or some people who you can interact with\
      \ without censoring yourself at all\u2026 I\u2019m sure many do and many do\
      \ not. and that proportion is something fluid, changing by changes in perspective,\
      \ by meeting new people and reconnecting with parts of yourself or others that\
      \ you hadn\u2019t in a while.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA friend of mine while exploring\
      \ an interest in the innocence project recently said that the death sentence\
      \ reduces the entirety of a human being, their love, their curiosity, generosity,\
      \ spice, tenacity, chutzpah, talent, and opportunity for anything and reduces\
      \ it to the worst thing they\u2019ve ever done. This is my interpretation, but\
      \ the statement was originally \u201Ca person is not the worst thing they\u2019\
      ve ever done\u201D and thus by sentencing a person to death, you hone in on\
      \ the worst thing they\u2019ve ever done and make everything else meaningless\
      \ in sentencing that person to death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think the most perfect\
      \ thing in the world is an imperfect idea. Because when people hear it, everyone\
      \ has something to say about it, ways its wrong, its right, can be improved\
      \ or is offensive. Maybe it\u2019s just a way of giving arbitrary value to a\
      \ series of unfinished thoughts thats lead me to say this but I think there\u2019\
      s immeasurable value in giving people the feeling that they can and know how\
      \ to change and improve on something. I think unfinished, sporadic crazy thoughts\
      \ give people that ability sometimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI just started a new job,\
      \ and i can tell you that saying a nice thing, taking interest in someone else\u2019\
      s world, doing something, ANYTHING, that shows that you\u2019re a little interested\
      \ in their existence, and saying it with confidence, makes a huge difference\
      \ in your life and the other persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA girl I know described\
      \ her experience with a guy she just started dating as constantly being saved\
      \ at the last minute, as in this guy would do or say a series of things she\
      \ didn\u2019t really connect to or love and then just as things were waning,\
      \ he said or did something that she really understood/connected with and it\
      \ saved the relationship bringing the chemistry back up to the stars. Just hearing\
      \ that characterization\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRemember that the right advice for your\
      \ professional development is likely very different and might even oppose the\
      \ right advice for your personal happiness, development, wellbeing whatever\
      \ buzzword you use that carries the least amount of BS in your mind.\r\n\r\n\
      \r\n\r\nI\u2019m scared that as I\u2019m growing up I\u2019m seeing less and\
      \ less of the world and of people and i want to get to the root of it the way\
      \ a doctor diagnoses a patient with a rare but identifiable virus.\r\n\r\n\r\
      \n\r\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve always been anything but i know i\u2019\
      ve always been someone who teetered between the more patronizing \u201CPhilosophical\u201D\
      \ and the less challenging \u201Cwise.\u201D (Less challenging in that recognizing\
      \ someone as wise feels to me like less of a challenge, because it supposedly\
      \ recognizes something you\u2019ve said as valuable, but doesn\u2019t move along\
      \ the conversation or idea.\r\n\r\nYears ago when I first devised a plan to\
      \ write for the listserve i told myself that what the world needed was more\
      \ honesty. i deeply believe that nothing bad can happen when you\u2019re just\
      \ honest. This evening, I took that to mean giving something unfiltered to show\
      \ people where my thoughts are on any given day (which albeit is probably a\
      \ weird way to interpret honesty and may not even be that). I know I could have\
      \ said something more helpful professionally, or do my best to put on my DFW\
      \ hat and get you all to think differently about something surprising and awe\
      \ inspiring but also right under your noses, but I didn\u2019t and I hope that\
      \ some of you still enjoyed it.\r\nLast but certainly not least I want to thank\
      \ the following past writers for your emails. They\u2019ve inspired be, humbled\
      \ me, brought me up when i felt down, exposed me to a new literary voice and\
      \ given me endless inspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
      Questions:\r\n\r\nDo you think there is a right time for something to come up\
      \ in conversation at a point when it\u2019ll carry the most weight? What about\
      \ in professional situation or with a therapist? What thing in life do and don\u2019\
      t exist on a spectrum (Sexuality, gender, Depression, Anxiety, Success etc.)\
      \ Is there anything you see as absolute? Do you think you can entertain these\
      \ thoughts in your current life striving for professional success of personal\
      \ satisfaction?\r\n\r\n\r\nDaniel N.\r\ndeniablyneurotic@gmail.com\r\nNew York,\

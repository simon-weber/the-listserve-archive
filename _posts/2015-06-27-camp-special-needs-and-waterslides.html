    body: "Summer camp is a kind big deal for me. No, not a kind of a big deal, kind\
      \ of HUGE deal.  It hasn't actually been the times I was a camper that have\
      \ been a big deal, but really when I was on the other side of it, as a counselor\
      \ and unit head.  Camp Ramah is a Jewish sleep-away camp located in a small\
      \ but amazing town called Ojai in California.  It\u2019s a place that I have\
      \ called my home from June until August for the past 7 years and it\u2019s a\
      \ place that I hold very near and dear to my heart.  I had my first kiss at\
      \ camp, my first \"going against the grain\" moment and my first moments of\
      \ questioning my own beliefs, but I think the strongest part of my experience\
      \ has been the people I have met.  I have been lucky enough to make incredible\
      \ friendships with people who were my age, years older or even years younger\
      \ than me.  Just imagine; you get to remove yourself from your  \"typical\"\
      \ environment and are able to live in a place encompassed by mountains, trees\
      \ and fresh air.  A place where you don\u2019t have to be afraid to confine\
      \ to the \u201Cnorms\u201D of society.  You truly get to be the best version\
      \ of yourself.\r\n\r\nFor the past two years, I have had the privilege of being\
      \ the \u201CRosh\u201D (or unit head) for a very incredible group of kids. \
      \ The Tikvah program at Camp Ramah is a program for campers (Amitzim) and staff\
      \ members (Ezra) with special needs.  Just like the rest of the 550 other typical\
      \ campers, kids in Amitzim get to go down the pool waterslides everyday, play\
      \ sports, enjoy music, and even go on an overnight to sleep under the stars.\
      \   At Ramah, these kids get to be the rock stars of camp, a place where they\
      \ are treated as campers who are awesome, fun loving and very special.  Living\
      \ in a world where this community typically doesn\u2019t get this much positive\
      \ attention has changed the way that I live my life.  Not in a drastic way,\
      \ but in a way in which I am more aware of the different types of people around\
      \ me and the way that I engage with them.  I feel very blessed to be a part\
      \ of this community.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is the first summer that I will not\
      \ be back at this camp.  I just finished my first year of teaching kindergarten\
      \ and I am ready grow and to try new things.  Part of me really envies the people\
      \ who are working there (both family members and friends) and get to partake\
      \ in the magic of camp, but a part of me is excited for the opportunities in\
      \ the future.  If you get the chance, I highly recommend going to camp.  Whether\
      \ you\u2019re a kid or an adult, it doesn\u2019t matter.  There is a camp out\
      \ there for you.  And if you can\u2019t be at camp, then at least live by the\
      \ camp mantra and try to be the best version of yourself.\r\n\r\nThanks Emily\
      \ for telling me about the Listserve years ago and being the best co counselor\
      \ out there!! You\u2019re an amazing Rosh and I\u2019m so proud of what you\u2019\
      re doing at camp! I also want to tell my boyfriend Jared that I\u2019m very\
      \ proud of all of your hard work studying for the California Bar!  Also Brian,\
      \ you just finished at GW and are moving on to amazing things, helping the world\
      \ one day at a time.  Love you Vanessa, Amanda, Emily, Mom and Dad!!\r\n\r\n\

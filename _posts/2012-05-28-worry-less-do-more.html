    <p>How many times have you denied yourself an opportunity because of worry - maybe
    you felt like you weren''t ready, or that you didn''t deserve something enough?</p>

    <p>If the answer to that question is &#8220;never&#8221; then you''re very lucky
    indeed but most people  have held themselves back on many an occasion. Personally,
    towards the end of last year I was holding myself back to the point where I was
    hardly doing anything new or creative, stuck in a self-imposed rut.</p>

    <p>I''m not saying we should try to never worry about anything, because it''s
    perfectly natural to worry sometimes, and certain things in life will always cause
    anxiety.</p>

    <p>What''s important is to learn to realise when we''re worrying unnecessarily
    and devise strategies for dealing with it in a productive way.</p>

    <p>Those strategies will be unique to you, so you''ll have to work them out yourself.
    It''s really easy though &#8211; all you need to do is take a little &#8220;quiet
    time&#8221; whenever you feel worried, frame your worry into a statement and then
    come up with a logical solution.</p>

    <p>For example:<br />&#8220;I''m worried that if I go for a job interview I might
    mess it up and make myself look stupid&#8221;<br />Strategy: &#8220;So I will
    make sure I''m fully prepared for my interview and perhaps roleplay with a friend
    so I can practise&#8221;</p>

    <p>Quite often I find that just turning a vague worry into a definitive statement
    makes the solution obvious.</p>

    <p>Of course, sometimes you really aren''t ready for that new job, or physically
    fit enough to run that marathon &#8211; but at least this way you have some kind
    of action plan.</p>

    <p>Once you have the hang of dealing with minor worries in this way, you should
    find that you''ll spend less time thinking about doing stuff, and more time actually
    doing stuff.</p>

    <p>You won''t always succeed, but if you''re worrying less and doing more, failure
    is just a side effect of all the awesome new things you''re experiencing rather
    than a crushing defeat.</p>

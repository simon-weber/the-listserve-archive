      \ friend, Bianca, told me about it. She had copied this particularly moving\
      \ quote and shared it with me. You see, she was reaching out to me and showing\
      \ up for me as a good friend should.\r\n\r\nBeing fairly new to the listserve,\
      \ I have considered what I would send, but haven't dedicated a lot of intellectual\
      \ and emotional energy to it. Of course I would win on a week when I start a\
      \ new job working more hours and with an earlier start time than I am used to.\
      \ Of course I would win in the middle of the workweek so there's no time to\
      \ prep, or type it out on a computer, and so I end up writing my entry using\
      \ the note function on my iPhone. Of course.\r\nI wonder if that's how it happens\
      \ for many folks.\r\n\r\nThe reason Bianca was reaching out to me, and why I\
      \ so deeply appreciate it, is because last year, my best friend died. It was\
      \ my first true, life-altering experience with grief. He wasn't the first person\
      \ I loved to die as I don't have any living grandparents. But there is a difference\
      \ between losing someone who has experienced a long and full life, and someone\
      \ who hadn't reached thirty. Hogan dying was the first, but far from the last\
      \ horrible thing that happened in the world and in my life during 2016.\r\n\r\
      \nIn an attempted plan for self-care surrounding the anniversary of Hogan's\
      \ death in February of this year, I started journaling with more fervor and\
      \ frequency. I started making lists: what made Hogan such an amazing friend,\
      \ moments when I felt like a good friend, moments when someone was a good friend\
      \ to me, random acts of kindness, and what makes a friendship great. After looking\
      \ over the lists, editing, adding to them, I realized that the single most important\
      \ quality to being a great friend is SHOWING UP.\r\nShowing up can be what Bianca\
      \ did, sending a text message with a great quote just to reach out. It can be\
      \ a phone call, a post card, liking every single post on their Facebook page\
      \ over the past two months, going to dinner, a hug, mailing a mix cd, buying\
      \ a keychain as a gift, picking up a cheesy magnet on your vacation to gift\
      \ to a friend, a handmade Valentine, buying a plane ticket for a visit, bringing\
      \ flowers, emailing a poem, inviting someone to an event or to your home for\
      \ dinner, leaving amazing voicemails, tagging a friend in funny memes on Instagram,\
      \ or celebrating big life events. In the depth of my grief, I stopped showing\
      \ up for other people or for myself, but people never stopped showing up for\
      \ me. The phone call from a friend where they repeated the following as I cried:\
      \ \"you are not a burden. I love you. It is not a burden to love someone who\
      \ is grieving\" may be one of the most significant of my grief journey, and\
      \ has been something I've now been able to say to someone else.\r\nSHOW UP.\
      \ For the people you love, and for the disenfranchised. Do more. Love more.\r\
      \n\r\nOh, and what I learned about legacies in the wake of Hogan's death is\
      \ that they are so much more than children. He was young and didn't have children\
      \ yet, but his legacy is not weaker because of this. He showed up for people\
      \ in his life fully. There's a whole group of us who will never stop talking\
      \ about him, how wonderful he was, and how the way he loved and lived was something\
      \ we will never forget. We call it Hogan Percent, which means living life at\
      \ more than 100%.\r\n\r\nSo thank you, Bianca, for sharing this community with\
      \ me, and for showing up for me and being a wonderful friend.\r\n\r\nMay we\
      \ all show up with love for other people and build a better future.\r\n\r\n\

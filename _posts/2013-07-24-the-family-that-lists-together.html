  body: "It started innocently enough, this family list-making fetish. My husband,\
    \ two children, and I were having a family conversation after dinner, and someone\
    \ mentioned that it had been a while since anyone had spent the night with us.\
    \ Something in me sparked an idea: how many people had indeed slept in our brick\
    \ rancher over the years? The kiddos began rattling names of their friends while\
    \ I got pen and paper and began recording. \u201CJustin, Mark, Josh...\u201D our\
    \ son offered. Our daughter chimed in with \u201CAmy, Ashley, Christine...\u201D\
    . My husband began reciting the names of relatives who have made the trek to visit\
    \ us here in Alabama. Soon the list grew to over thirty people, which surprised\
    \ us all. Then our son recalled that we hosted two young men from a visiting church\
    \ choir one night; add two to the list! Didn't we shuffle beds around to accommodate\
    \ our neighbor's parents when they paid a surprise visit? Add two more! And so\
    \ it went, and when we felt we had exhausted all memory cells, nearly sixty names\
    \ were scrawled on a piece of paper. We sat in the glow of that list, eating ice\
    \ cream, remembering our visitors with warmth, and we did not know that the \u201C\
    after-dinner-making-a-list\u201D tradition had begun.\r\n\r\nIn the coming years,\
    \ we made lists short and long: states visited, movies that began with the letter\
    \ \u201CB\u201D, dogs we had petted, restaurants at which we'd eaten, and types\
    \ of Oreo's. Names of candy bars, state parks, car manufacturers, brands of toothpaste,\
    \ and pro football teams. Perhaps we'd be planning a trip to an amusement park,\
    \ and my son would express his desire to ride the newest coaster called the \u201C\
    Goliath\u201D or some such thing. \u201CWhat are the names of the coasters we've\
    \ already ridden?\u201D I'd ask, and, after the initial collective groan from\
    \ hubby and the kids, we were off and running as names came from all directions:\
    \ \u201CBlue Streak!\u201D \u201CThe Joker!\u201D \u201CMillennium Force!\u201D\
    \ and the list would grow to accommodate dozens of coaster names. Sometimes the\
    \ compiling of the list was a sad action, as the death of a friend sparked a listing\
    \ of \u201CWho have we known and loved and lost?\u201D and we became quiet as\
    \ names were recorded and the list grew longer than we would have wanted.\r\n\r\
    \nYears went by and we continued with our lists, although as the children grew\
    \ and spread their wings, the lists became more functional rather than for fun.\
    \ Lists were made for what to bring to college, for people to contact as possible\
    \ references, for repairs to be done around the house, for ways to earn income.\
    \ And when our daughter married, the list of wedding-things-to-be-done achieved\
    \ an epic level not seen before nor since.\r\n\r\nThe children are off on their\
    \ own now, but we visit each other when we can. We recently spent four days together\
    \ over a long weekend, and I felt the \u201Curge\u201D as we talked about board\
    \ games that we enjoyed and micro-brews we might try. But as we played \u201C\
    Loaded Questions\u201D and drank a flight of summer ales, I was too happy basking\
    \ in the moment to write anything down. I looked around the room and observed\
    \ my dear husband, our fun-loving son and his sweet girlfriend, our beautiful\
    \ daughter and her smart husband, wonderful in-laws, smoked sausages, a bottle\
    \ of bourbon, a sleeping dog, the sound of rain on the roof, a cozy blanket...wait\
    \ a moment...could someone please hand me that paper and pencil?\r\n\r\n\r\nSusan\t\

      <p>I found this on Reddit one day and it just made me think about how insignificant
      my life must be compared to the other 7 billion people on this planet. I''ve
      always thought of having so many problems, so much troubling me. But when you
      look at it from a wider perspective, billions of other people are having the
      same problems that you might have. Everyone shares their problems with everyone
      else, even though we might not meet each other in our entire lifetime.</p>

      <p>Lets consider the man serving coffee at my local cafe up the street. I''ve
      gone up and asked for a cup of water and a bagel maybe a few times, not really
      interested in this person life. But for all we know, he could be deep in debt,
      working his butt off to make up for student loans on a wasted degree that he
      never needed. This man has no time for a relationship, he has become a slave
      to the banks. His life is just as complex as mine or yours, if not more. The
      more you think about it, the more fun this game becomes. You can fabricate fantastic
      lives for people just by glancing at their faces. Maybe that person speeding
      on the freeway was on their way to the delivery of their baby, or to a very

      <p>As I near the end of your attention span, I must begin my concluding sentences.
      Your life is incomprehensibly small compared to the lives of the other people
      around you, most of whom you have never seen or never will see. And as much
      as we think that our lives are soooo much more important than the guy you shoved

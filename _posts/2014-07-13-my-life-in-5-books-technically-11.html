      The Little Red Car\u2019, by Rosalinda Kightley:\r\nI\u2019ve been informed\

      \ to get hold of a copy to try and work out what on earth was so good about\
      \ it.\r\n\r\nAs a child: \u2018After the Storm\u2019, by Nick Butterworth:\r\
      \nA storm damages an old oak tree in the middle of a park, leaving some animals\

      \ a cool, new tree house. I\u2019d like to say I loved this story because it\
      \ championed teamwork and positivity, but I think it was more because it had\
      \ a giant fold-out tree house poster at the back.\r\n\r\nGrowing up: The Harry\

      \ usually into reading. I queued at midnight to get a copy of the seventh book,\

      \ this book at the moment, but I\u2019ll never forget how I felt the first time\
      \ I read it in 2012. It made me laugh and cry, on and off, like my heart was\

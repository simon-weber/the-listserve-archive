      <p>A little bit about me: I am in a happy state right now; had a painful but
      relieving break-up; got promoted at work and overall life''s good. Realized
      that we just need to own up to our own mistakes in order to be happy. Forcing

      the way the road takes us and about being humble instead of stubborn in the
      face of change. Hope y''all like it!</p>

      <p>TEACH ME...<br />Tell me Dear Cloud,<br />Where did you learn to fly;<br
      />To fearlessly soar in peace,<br />And to effortlessly breathe the sky</p>

      <p>Tell me how, you stay above<br />The doldrums of this landscape;<br />And
      teach me your dignity,<br />When Gusts leave you no escape</p>

      <p>That imperious, innocent Wind with her antics,<br />And her mad, mischievous,
      mutable smirk;<br />Cloud, you wear it all with a smile<br />And with grace,
      forgive her every quirk</p>

      <p>Timid is her arrogance,<br />Her naivet&#233; neighbors neglect;<br />Invisibly
      she wields her way through you,<br />And yet seldom you object</p>

      <p>Fierce is your humility,<br />Your maturity margins magic;<br />You give
      her cowardice a beautiful face<br />Making her ungratefulness much more tragic</p>

      <p>I&#8217;m sure you see futility<br />In coaching us Humans humility,<br />For
      we cannot differ between Pride and ego;<br />Mistaking modesty for meekness
      wherever we go</p>

      <p>But educate me still, How you like a parent<br />Are the Sky we look up to

      <p>In 2009, I was just about to finish my dissertation and I had accepted my
      first job &#8211; a tenure-track position at a small liberal arts college in
      Montana.  I was moving to Montana from Chicago, and I was excited &#8211; but
      also apprehensive.  My anxiety came from a few places.  First, just the idea
      of starting the job itself &#8211; being the one in charge, and standing in
      front of a room of students who wanted me to have the answers &#8211; was fairly

      <p>Montana is spectacular:  raw and wild.  Drive just a few minutes out of town,

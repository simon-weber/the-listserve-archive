      <p>If it''s true that there''s currently 22,082 subscribers on this thing then
      there''s got to be people I know reading this that I don''t know are reading
      this. There''s also got to be many people I don''t know that I know are reading
      this. Both ways: whatup people!!</p>

      <p>One day I received a Listserve email from one "Steve Gattuso." I was confused.
      I''m "Steve Geluso." Why is this other name so bizarrely similar to my own?
      I replied and introduced myself. I found out Gattuso would soon start working
      in San Francisco where my buddy Joel works. Joel reads the Listserve too! Small
      world.</p>

      <p>Today it is Gattuso''s turn to receive an email from Geluso and perhaps be
      confused for a moment. I wish you the best, Gattuso!</p>

      <p>I''m in Seattle, WA. The best city in the world. I like the crisp weather

      In fact, I recommend you ride a bike whenever you''re traveling more than 10

    body: "I work in a funeral home, and I have some stories to share with you.\r\n\
      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce:\r\n\r\nAt a graveside service, a dove was released\
      \ as a symbol of a free soul at peace. As the priest invited everyone to watch\
      \ the bird circle in the sky, a hawk suddenly darted in and knocked the dove\
      \ straight out of the air; the dead weight dropped into some nearby bushes.\
      \ Everyone watched on as the bird of prey made a beeline to its lunch. The family\
      \ wondered out loud if they still had to pay for the dove release.\r\n\r\n\r\
      \n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce:\r\n\r\n            Staff were in the upstairs office while\
      \ a visitation was going on downstairs, when a blood-curdling shriek filled\
      \ the funeral home.  Rushing downstairs, we expected to find someone collapsed\
      \ from a heart attack. Turns out the family hadn\u2019t checked what exactly\
      \ was already on the USB stick they had given us to load with pictures, to play\
      \ on loop throughout the course of the visitation. Surprise: interspersed with\
      \ heart-warming photos of the deceased and his family was also homemade amateur\
      \ pornography starring the man now in the casket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDid\
      \ you know?:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDead bodies poop. A lot. Hence, packing orifices\
      \ with cotton to prevent leakage is crucial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCrazy glue is like\
      \ the duct tape of the embalming room. The uses are virtually endless.\r\n\r\
      \n\r\n\r\nVaseline will bring blackened, dehydrated lips right back to their\
      \ pre-dead plumpness in a matter of hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespect to the body\
      \ is key in every prep room I\u2019ve worked in. Bodies must be covered with\
      \ sheets to maintain dignity, embalming equipment and tools should never be\
      \ placed on top of anyone, and though the atmosphere is casual \u2013 singing\
      \ along to the radio while embalming is something I do often \u2013 jokes are\
      \ never made at the expense of the deceased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMaking a body look\
      \ \u201Cnatural\u201D and \u201Cresting\u201D is ironically one of the most\
      \ unnatural and arduous tasks. Hours go into injecting, massaging, suturing,\
      \ aspirating, dressing, cosmetizing and casketing, to create that perfect \u201C\
      just sleeping\u201D look. The amount of detail painstakingly taken to create\
      \ a comforting and lasting memory is enormous, and though I have strong opinions\
      \ on whether or not our approach to death is psychologically healthy, I have\
      \ a deep respect for skilled embalmers and the work they do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\
      \ Pro tips:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Don\u2019t send low-cut clothing for\

      \ for embalming, which is usually along the collarbone.  Along the same lines:\
      \ pulling jeans or tight clothing onto a clammy dead person is not easy. Think\
      \ of your local mortician, stick with easy breezy blouse and slacks.\r\n\r\n\
      \r\n\r\n            Do understand that just because we\u2019ve been given a\

      s because they aren\u2019t.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Don\u2019t ask us to\

      \ a visitation in your living room and building a casket. The more personal\

      \ the healthier the grieving process tends to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers to life\

      \n\r\nIt\u2019s kind of funny \u2014I am an eighteen year old boy who should\

      \ Go to work. Do homework. Eat. Shower. Sleep. Repeat.\r\n\r\nI mean people\
      \ have warned me that life out of high school sucked, but no one could have\
      \ really prepared me for this. While my peers are out of state at some fancy\
      \ University, having the time of their lives partying, drinking, and networking\
      \ with a variety of people.. I am here, stuck on this rock, going to a community\
      \ college, and living paycheck to paycheck.\r\n\r\nI was told that doing great\
      \ things in high school would amount to great things out of high school, but\
      \ that was just a way of getting me to go to class. I\u2019ve done sports, I\
      \ was a vital role in the school\u2019s yearbook, I was enrolled in advanced\
      \ placement classes, I participated in numerous clubs (service/leisure), I have\
      \ held leadership positions in those clubs, always went out of my way to volunteer,\
      \ and I even represented the state in a national competition and placed 3rd\
      \ overall.\r\n\r\nAll these things may have been a great experience for me,\
      \ but it just sucks knowing that it all amounted to this. Here I am. Stuck.\r\
      \n\r\nAlthough my life isn\u2019t the greatest at this moment, I like to look\
      \ at it knowing that it could be worse. I mean there is always someone out there\
      \ in the world that has it worse, just as there is always someone in the world\
      \ who has it better. This sort of gives me a modest way of looking at life:\
      \ I am not walking around with my nose up in the air nor am I moping around\
      \ hoping everyone takes pity on me.\r\n\r\nAs for the quote above, I don\u2019\
      t really know what Picasso meant by it. I\u2019m guessing that it takes a very\
      \ long time until you actually get to understand the meaning of all of this\
      \ crap. And that it takes a very long time for you to actually enjoy life because\
      \ we have to work for it.. That you know, we will have the opportunity to be\
      \ \u2018youthful\u2019 when are have finally made a name for ourselves. When\
      \ we stop trying to please everyone and start doing things just for the hell\
      \ of it.\r\n\r\nWhile typing this, I\u2019ve realized how dull my life has become\
      \ and that\u2019s just no bueno. So although life has been stressful let\u2019\
      s try to remember the fun in life \u2013and let\u2019s not get all caught up\
      \ in this shit. I think with a balance of work and fun, time will be that much\

      <p>Now then, let&#8217;s get down to it.</p>

      <p>I donated bone marrow last spring to a stranger who has since passed away.
      I do not know the name, location, or the details of when this individual died
      and I&#8217;m not quite sure how to deal with my grief over this. Maybe y&#8217;all

      <p>It was a few summers ago that I found myself sticking a Q-tip in my mouth
      and rubbing it along the inside of my cheeks.  A little cottonmouth and an odd
      taste was the result, and it was altogether not an entirely unpleasant experience.
      Though, it did feel odd to send it off in an envelope to be scrutinized instead
      of examining it under a microscope myself, as if it was some Freshman Bio lab
      exercise. Twice, I was identified as a potential match for someone needing to
      undergo a marrow transplant, and twice I was subjected to an intense phone interview

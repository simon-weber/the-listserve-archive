      m finally ready to do something with this idea. I now have a platform to contact\
      \ people all over the world, to say:\r\n\r\nWe all have a go-to recipe when\

      \ or simply over a set of hills to the next county.\r\n\r\nIf you have a recipe\
      \ or story that you would like to share, please reply to this e-mail. It would\
      \ be wonderful to know where you consider home, where you currently live, and\
      \ in addition to your go-to recipe, a little bit about what it means to you.\r\
      \n\r\nI can\u2019t promise that this will end in a book, but I do have plans\
      \ to at the very least share these recipes and stories online (with permission).\r\
      \n\r\nIf you\u2019re curious, my own go-to comfort food (or at least the one\
      \ that I go-to most frequently), is my mother\u2019s Caesar salad recipe, which\
      \ includes so much garlic that the next morning you wake up and are still reminded\
      \ of home. I\u2019ll give you a copy of the recipe, if you do reply.\r\n\r\n\

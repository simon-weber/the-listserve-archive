      />In April of 2016, I went through the worst breakup I have ever experienced.
      It was my second love, you know the kind they say is ''the hard love''. The
      kind of love where trying to make it work becomes more important than whether
      it actually should. This is the love that teaches you a lesson and the love

      drugs and alcohol. I asked him, begged him, to talk to me (to no avail). I went
      out of my way to drive past his place on my way home from work. I was a mess.
      I was convinced that this cycle would continue for the rest of my life: meet
      someone, fall in love, live happily, crash &amp; burn.<br />But there were other

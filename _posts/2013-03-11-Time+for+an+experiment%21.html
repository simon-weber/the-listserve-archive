<p>Hi! My name is Randy Lubin and today we're going to conduct an experiment. The goal is to explore the social network of Listserve members.</p>
<p>Summary:<br />Each participant will start an email chain that will eventually reach me, but only by going through friends / acquaintances. By analyzing the chains we can learn about the structures of our social networks.</p>
<p>Rule 1: If you know Randy Lubin, forward this email to listserve@randylubin.com and included your current city<br />Rule 2: If you don't know Randy Lubin, forward these instructions to someone you know, who might know him.<br />Rule 3: As you forward the email, include your current city (I'm going to map out the different chains)</p>
<p>A bit about me to help you in your quest:<br />1) I am 26 years old and grew up in Livingston, New Jersey<br />2) I went to undergrad at Washington University in St. Louis and graduated in 2009<br />3) I went to Stanford for an MBA and graduated in 2011<br />4) I live in San Francisco, California<br />5) I'm active in the tech / startup scene and work for a company called Jive Software</p>
<p>As the email chains start reaching my inbox, I'm going to create a map of all the different paths. I'll also write up some interesting insights from the data and share them with all of the participants.</p>
<p>This could be very interesting - I hope you enjoy this!</p>
<p>Take care,<br />Randy Lubin<br />listserve@randylubin.com<br />San Francisco, CA</p>
<p>p.s. this is based on the Small World Experiments by Stanley Milgram in the 1960s. Check it out on Wikipedia if you want to learn more - it's tied closely with the concept of 'six degrees of separation'.</p>

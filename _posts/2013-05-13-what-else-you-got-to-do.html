  body: "I guess, here's my story in a tight nutshell. Last August, I moved from DC\
    \ to Australia for graduate school. In that time my father got very sick. I returned\
    \ home and stayed by his side during his miraculous recovery (seriously, the doctors\
    \ were even shocked). He was discharged and went home on a path to full recovery\
    \ and I returned to school in Australia.  Late one night, I got a phone call from\
    \ my cousin telling me that my dad's condition had unexpectedly taken a drastic\
    \ turn for the worse and he didnt have much time left. So ten thousand miles apart\
    \ and over speaker phone, I had to say my last words to my father. He passed minutes\
    \ later. \r\n\r\nI'm telling this to 20K+ strangers because since he passed I\
    \ have felt scared and alone and apprehensive about the future. And I know I cant\
    \ be the only one going through this.\r\n\r\nI had never lost anyone before and\
    \ my father was always the quiet reassurance I needed to keep me going. Losing\

    \ suck. You are allowed to cry and be upset. Don't let anyone take that from you.\
    \ Question your deity, question your purpose in life. Scream to the sky and sink\
    \ to the abyss of sorrow. Do whatever it takes to make it through that second,\

    \ story or keep it to yourself- whichever makes you feel more empowered, do it.\

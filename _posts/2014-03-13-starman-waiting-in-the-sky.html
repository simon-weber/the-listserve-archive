    body: "I'm listening ''Is it my body?'' by Alice Cooper while writing this, you\
      \ all will notice how unstable this letter is, also, I tend to start talking\
      \ about something but end up with a different thing, also y'all can call me\
      \ Miitcher, that's how most of my friends call me, back to Alice, I will meet\
      \ him on my birthday (08/29)! strangely, there's a bittersweet feeling inside\
      \ that makes me think ''wow, I'm very old''.\r\n\r\nIt's like having a midlife\
      \ crisis at my 20's, did any of you been thru that feeling?\r\n\r\nIs it suffering\
      \ the reason our hearts grow old? Let that sink in.\r\nShort story: last year\
      \ I met Steven Tyler and I was so nervous that started to dry crying after I\
      \ talked him, what? you don't know what ''dry crying'' is?\r\n\r\nThat is when\
      \ you're so overwhelmed that you can't even deal with your own self, literally\
      \ I found myself crying ''outside in''.\r\nThen again, Je ne sais pas where\
      \ I'm heading anymore, by this time, I was supposed to be somewhere else, to\
      \ be honest, I was expecting more from myself.\r\n\r\nI'm a photographer and\
      \ also started to run a blog with one of my friends, that it's pretty much about\
      \ music, fashion brands and the impact they have in society and 90's shows that\
      \ me and my best friend miss a lot, we decided to call it The True Blog.\r\n\
      \r\nSince a young age I started traveling, my first trip was to Barbados and\
      \ I'm coming back in a couple of months.\r\n\r\nShort story: what I do most\
      \ of the time of the year is going to concerts, so, once I asked Ozzy Osbourne:\
      \ ''Ozzyyyyy, can you choke me?''\r\n\r\nYeahh, I know, please don't tell me\
      \ how ridiculous that sounds, thank God there were only five people in the room\
      \ when I asked that.\r\n\r\nDid I say where I'm from? well, if you look at a\
      \ map, there's a really tiny country, called El Salvador.\r\n\r\nI wonder if\
      \ Lady Gaga is subscribed to the listserve, can you imagine getting a e-mail\
      \ from her?\r\n\r\nit would be cool, a couple years ago I lost a piece of my\
      \ heart, my grandma, men, I swear she was like, the coolest human being ever\
      \ and I still love her, the same way I loved her the first day I saw her.\r\n\
      \r\nLast short story:\r\nMarilyn Manson, Tampa, if any of the people who was\
      \ backstage is here: HELLO EVERYONE!\r\n\r\nMeeting this man was awesome, I\
      \ literally ran to him and gave him a huge hug, he hugged me back too, I gave\
      \ him action figures of Vilma and Scooby, the main topic was Scooby Doo, I told\
      \ him literally everything and more!\r\nWhen the girl was about to take our\
      \ picture, I threw my leg right over him and told him ''Believe me, it will\
      \ look great for the photo''\r\n\r\nI'm laughing while writing this, he probably\
      \ don't even remember any of this.\r\n\r\nThat's it guys!\r\n\r\nNow let me\

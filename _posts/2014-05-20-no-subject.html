      \ because they were unable to find work. At the same time the government decided\
      \ they needed the majority share in the student loan business to protect students\
      \ from predatory lending practices. The result? A massive amount of debt that\
      \ is owned by the government, which is sure to be the \"housing bubble\" for\
      \ the next generation. We have got to figure out a better way to finance higher\
      \ education to ensure accessibility for future generations.\r\n\r\nFinally,\
      \ I'd love to hear from you. Whether you're a student in the US who \"didn't\
      \ know\" they had student loans, or someone from another country who has an\
      \ idea as to how we can reform higher education financing here in the US. I\

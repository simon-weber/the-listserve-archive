      \ presentation skills, just to give some more value to the participants.\r\n\
      \r\nUse the idea if you like it. I for sure do and will continue hosting these\

      <p>A couple of weeks ago I''ve invited my friend James to host this dinner together.
      We decided on the time, place and then each of us invited their guests. We hosted
      it to stay in touch with people we consider valuable, who we''d like to spend
      more time with. The trick is that they are not from our closest circle, thus
      it''s a wee bit harder (a day is only 24 hours long after all).</p>

      <p>At the same time we used the opportunity to meet new people and that''s why
      we hosted this meeting together, James and I. We handpicked the guests, so they
      had a guarantee that people they meet are worth their time. Maybe they will
      not become great friends (and maybe they will), but for sure there was a chance
      to do some business, discuss projects, get advice etc.</p>

      <p>Of course there''s a lot more people we''d like to stay in touch with and
      that''s why we''re planning on making these meetings recurring. The idea is
      to host them always in pairs, but everytime different ones and everytime with
      a different set of guests. This way we can stay in touch with more of our friends,
      get to know more people and infuse more people with the same idea. So at the
      end of the meeting James and I, each of us asked one person to co-host the next
      meetings. So next time we&#8217;ll have 2 separate meetings hosted. We&#8217;ll

      It will be up to the participants if they&#8217;d like to do join though.</p>

      <p>So there are 2 rules:<br />- always 2 hosts,<br />- each invites 4 guests.<br

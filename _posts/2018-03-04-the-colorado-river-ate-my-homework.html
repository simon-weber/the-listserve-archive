      \ against a calm breeze along that beautiful green River, we pulled in at Lower\
      \ Jackass to camp. I jumped off the boat into waist deep quicksand, and ended\
      \ up crawling to shore. They all laughed, thinking I was pretending to be a\
      \ dog. I hate quicksand. We were getting to know one another. Later that night\
      \ while pitching my tent, I said to the geology professor, \"it's a good idea\

      \ like I was mad. Getting to know one another. A couple hours later my tent\
      \ and everything in it (iPhone, wallet with ID, cards, and some cash, most my\
      \ clothing, my handmade down sleeping bag and expensive pad, and many other\

      \ Day 1 of a 20-day float.\r\n\r\nDay 2 my loaner sleeping pad popped and it\
      \ became a cold night. Day 3 rashes started on my face, neck, and my hands swelled\
      \ so much they started to crack open. And so on. Day 19 my camp chair broke\
      \ into five pieces when the cicerone rudely farted on me. Day 20 I got internet\
      \ access and discovered my work life is a bit of a shambles, and people depending\
      \ on me are frustrated in my absence. I'm stranded in Flagstaff in a blizzard\
      \ (so much snow!) without ID or a phone, and I'm still wearing the same clothes,\

["[The Listserve] Connections and Collaborations", "Brandon", "It\u2019s really easy for me to fall into a way of thinking that keeps me moving in the same direction.  I don\u2019t like how my life feels when I let that happen for too long, so I give myself projects.  This coupled with some mild obsessive compulsive tendencies causes me to fixate on the end goal until I\u2019ve thoroughly exhausted the point of the project.  Sometimes this leaves me very satisfied with what I\u2019ve done/made/experienced and other times I find myself oddly ashamed or empty.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t expect anyone to necessarily understand any of that, but I know how I feel when I\u2019m in this kind of state and thought it could be helpful if others who might feel that way too knew they weren\u2019t alone.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m working really hard on being vulnerable, too.  It\u2019s a scary concept when you\u2019ve spent your entire life believing (for good reason) that the best way to live is in a constant state of emotional vigilance.  I\u2019m finding, though, that I\u2019m not happy.  So I have made the decision to deliberately open myself up to all of the possibilities that vulnerability offers, both the good and the bad.  I try to remind myself that as painful as circumstances may get, they won\u2019t kill me\u2026 and I\u2019ll make my way through the worst.  Also, that it won\u2019t be all bad\u2026 that I\u2019m motivated by the good possibilities that I know exist.  It\u2019s a foreign concept to me and difficult to execute throughout my life, but I\u2019m committed to making that discomfort my new normal.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of projects, I have a couple of app ideas for smartphones that I really believe the world would benefit from but I\u2019m not currently a developer.  I\u2019m in the process of learning, but I don\u2019t have the confidence in myself necessary to make these things the way I imagine them.  So, if you\u2019re a developer and are open to partnering with me on one or two ideas, reach out to me and we can discuss how to make that happen.\r\n\r\nI enjoy discussing meaningful topics:  politics, religion, ways to do life better\u2026.  I also enjoy a lot of different media, from music to books and shows.  So if you\u2019d like to talk about any of these things and you find that it\u2019s difficult or awkward to find a place to discuss these topics without encountering negative people or experiences, feel free to reach out to me.\r\n\r\nI have no advice for anyone, but I\u2019m happy to collaborate with any of you to make life better for us all.\r\n\r\nBe and Stay Well.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrandon\t\r\nListserve.brandon@gmail.com\t\r\nNew Windsor, MD\r\n\r\n", [2013, 7, 25]]

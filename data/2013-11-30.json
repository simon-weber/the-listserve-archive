["[The Listserve] A TL,DR; five questions; and smileys", "Ellie T.", "I\u2019m going to split this up into two sections: the first, a \u201cTL,DR\u201d for those who don\u2019t have much time; and the second, a longer, more expanded version of the first.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve only got a couple minutes to spare, here are some questions I want to ask you:\r\n\r\n1.      What sort of advice would you give a young adult?\r\n\r\n2.      What is your favourite book? (Movie, TV show, etc.)\r\n\r\n3.      Where is the best place you\u2019ve lived or visited? Most interesting adventure?\r\n\r\n4.      What is a something I should learn how to do?\r\n\r\n5.      If you haven\u2019t got anything to say to the above, then tell me a story about yourself! Anything at all, don\u2019t be shy!\r\n\r\n\r\nHopefully, that was short and sweet enough! I hope you\u2019ll consider giving me a reply J\r\n\r\nNow if you\u2019ve got a bit more time on your hands, allow me to expand on the above questions.\r\n\r\n1.      Nice to meet you! I am from Vancouver but am currently in Toronto as a second-year university student studying engineering, which means that yes, I am a young adult and yes, I am unabashedly looking for tips on life! I\u2019ve no doubt that there are a wide variety of people reading this, and I wager a fair amount of you all will have lived and experienced more than me. So if you have any sort of advice at all, I\u2019d love to hear it!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.      I love reading. Love, love, LOVE it! One of my favourite book series\u2019 is Harry Potter, which you might have heard of \u2026 it really inspired my love of books. I\u2019m always on the hunt for new ones to read, so if you have a recommendation, please send it my way! Now, I understand that not everyone shares my joy, so if you have a particular movie, TV show, or even song you really enjoy, I\u2019m definitely willing to expand my horizons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.      One of my wishes in life is to travel. Unfortunately, with my limited student budget, it\u2019s a bit difficult at the moment, but I would love to hear your adventures. Having only visited a paltry number of countries so far (four \u2026 including Canada, where I was born), I would love to hear about some of your experiences, even if it just happened around the corner!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.      I am always on the lookout to try new things, so I ask you this: has a random skill ever proved useful? Or even something I should learn to do every day that will somehow improve my life? I\u2019d like to know!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5.      Stories. I like telling them, but I love hearing them more. Share with me any experience that you deem worthy \u2013 it may have been years ago, or it may have just happened yesterday! Whatever it is, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll really enjoy reading about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s it! Thanks for taking the time out of your day from reading an email from someone you don\u2019t even know \u2013 it means a lot to me! If this has caught your attention somehow, I\u2019d love to get a response, and I promise that I\u2019ll write back, really!\r\n\r\nWith that, enjoy the rest of your day (or night, as it may be)! J\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nEllie T.\r\nellielistserve@gmail.com\r\nToronto, Canada\r\n\r\n", [2013, 11, 30]]

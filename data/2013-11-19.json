["[The Listserve] If you have the time,", "Sam Alleman", "A few recommendations based on time constraints:\r\n\r\nIf you have 4 minutes, listen to Edward Elgar's Nimrod from the Enigma Variations, or Pink Mountaintops' While We Were Dreaming. \r\nIf you have 8 minutes, listen to Rossini's L'italiana in Algeri.\r\n\r\nIf you have 50 minutes, watch Top Gear (UK); I recommend the 2007 Botswana special first (series 10, episode 4, available on Netflix). \r\nIf you have around 80 minutes, watch the Duplass brothers' \"Jeff, Who Lives at Home\" or Mike Birbiglia's \"Sleepwalk with Me,\" both on Netflix (you can also listen to the latter on Spotify, which is just as great in audio format).\r\n\r\nIf you have an hour or so, read Antoine de Saint-Exupery's Le Petit Prince.\r\nIf you have a day or so, read Chaim Potok's The Chosen.\r\n\r\nAn easy recipe that's a big hit at work parties for being a somewhat healthy appetizer is veggie rolls:\r\nChop up 1 med. broccoli crown, 1 med. green or red bell pepper, and 1 cup carrots. Add to 3 oz softened cream cheese, 12 oz ranch dip, and 2 cups shredded cheddar. Spread thinly among 10-ct tortilla wraps and roll tightly, then roll tightly again in saran wrap. Let them chill in the frig for a few hours, remove the saran wrap, and cut into bite-size pieces.\r\n\r\nIf you try any of the above, let me know what you think. I'd love to hear your music/movie/book suggestions as well - I'm on twitter at @SamAlleman or use the email below.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading.\r\n\r\n\r\nSam Alleman\r\nsamantha.alleman89@gmail.com\r\nExton, Pennsylvania\r\n\r\nP.S. If you have 30 seconds, check your spam folder. Otherwise, you might miss the email telling you you've won the Listserve lottery. Thanks to the Listserve team for the second chance.\r\n\r\n", [2013, 11, 19]]

["[The Listserve] On Quitting", "The Listserve", "I\u2019m a proud quitter.\r\n\r\nColleges, jobs, lovers, projects, friends, towns, countries, you name it. I would have quit the planet if Mars One had been ready yet. This isn't the part that makes me especially proud.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s like Brewster\u2019s Millions and I\u2019m the Richard Pryor of quitting: I have a certain amount of Quit to spend each day or I\u2019ll lose it. The turning point for me was discovering that I could chose, in advance, what to quit and not be forced to meet my quota in regrettable meltdowns.\r\n\r\nQuitting isn\u2019t bad in and of itself. Huh. I can\u2019t tell you how freeing this realization has been. I mean, I have become such a good quitter that it\u2019s possibly my superpower--and who wants to relinquish a superpower? No need to when it can be harnessed.\r\n\r\nI searched for things to quit. Didn\u2019t have to look far. Turns out many habits are well worth quitting anyway and take a quitter\u2019s grit. I focused on habits that *I* can\u2019t easily moderate, that--no matter how much I enjoy them--addict me. Everyone would have a different list. Roughly in this order, I've quit:\r\n\r\n * TV\r\n * Tobacco\r\n * News\r\n * Alcohol\r\n * Marijuana\r\n * Caffeine\r\n * Porn\r\n * Masturbation\r\n * Sugar\r\n * Carbs\r\n * Processed Food\r\n\r\nNot everyone can or even should be a quitter, I suppose. But it's worked for me.\r\n\r\nHow does it feel? Rad, yes. It\u2019s no magic bullet, but I am much more comfortable being just me right where I am.\r\n\r\nWhat do I do with the extra juice? I enter waking dreams as often as possible: by playing with kids, by drawing, and by reading and writing fiction.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re not getting the mileage you want, why not embrace your inner quitter?\r\n\r\nNext up on my Quit List:\r\n\r\n * Buying New Things\r\n * Making Trash\r\n * Taking It Personally\r\n * Being Quiet About It\r\n\r\nI\u2019m taking suggestions and I\u2019m curious: What would you quit?\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nMike\r\nmichael.carychao@gmail.com\r\nBerkeley, California, USA\r\n\r\nP.S. - My science fiction and slice-of-life short stories are out there as ebooks, if you\u2019re into that kind of thing. Here\u2019s to keeping quit.\r\n\r\n", [2013, 10, 26]]

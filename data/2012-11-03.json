["[The Listserve]", "Frances Gill", "FUN STUFF:\r\n\r\n1. I\u2019m 21 and a pre-med student. I like reading writing cleaning yoga and drinking. I work in a pizzeria.\r\n2. Who are you??\r\n3.

Currently waiting for Hurricane Sandy to hit Brooklyn\u2026\r\n\r\nOTHER STUFF:\r\n\r\nThere are a good number of days when I wake up hating myself. Sometimes I fall asleep hating myself and sometimes I have a weird dream that leaves me unsettled or off kilter and things start to crumble from there. It wasn't until about a year ago that I started to begin the process of realizing that this penance I was serving was not only unnecessary, but was destructive and self-perpetuating, was in fact the evils of the world coming to rest for a moment in my heart. I am starting to learn to take deep breaths and to override my own maladaptive mechanisms and to trust my instincts and to be free from this self-imposed tyranny and also of course to realize how much more frightening that is. I cry a lot but I think that's good and I'm extremely happy and lucky to have people in my life who can set my mind at ease.\r\n\r\nLove,\r\n\r\nFrances\r\n\r\n\r\nFrances Gill\t\r\nflg223@nyu.edu\t\r\nBushwick, Brooklyn, New York\r\n\r\n", [2012, 11, 3]]

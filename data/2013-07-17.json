["[The Listserve] To Do...", "Zack King", "I do love a list. My current strategy is to use monthly, weekly and daily lists. These are divided into sections and follow an ever-evolving layout. For example, \u2018People to Call\u2019 was recently promoted up the page due to lack of progress in this area. A good list must keep you on your toes; get too comfortable with the format and you\u2019ll start neglecting areas,  assuming their contents. After a leisurely peruse over the \u2018Tech to Do\u2019 section (this covers digital/online/phone-related tasks) I want to reach the bottom and then... Wham! Ah yes, we\u2019re out of bin bags.\r\n\r\nLists have to be handwritten. When I think of something to add, I make a note on my phone but will write it down at the first opportunity. Otherwise, how will I cross it off? The Backspace key cannot compete with the cathartic effect of a purposeful, conclusive pen movement. But a paper list can easily be lost and the thought of trying to remember as much as possible, knowing things will be forgotten (something important?) is just horrific. So I take photos of my lists as way of digital backup and peace of mind.\r\n\r\nMy dad has always been a list-man too. Once, during a busy Sunday afternoon of him getting-things-done, my auntie turned up unannounced. Dad was briefly flustered until he\u2019d popped over to his notepad and written something down. My auntie Hillary, having spotted this, went to have a look and was aghast to discover her brother had just given her a fifteen-minute time slot alongside the words, \u201cChat to Hil\u201d.\r\n\r\nDoes this list-writing result in me getting more things done? No. But at least I can be sure of what I haven\u2019t.\r\n\r\n\u201cWrite Listserve email\u201d, about to be crossed off.\r\n\r\n\r\nZack King\t\r\nzack.king@hotmail.com\t\r\nLondon\r\n\r\n", [2013, 7, 17]]

["[The Listserve] What you won't get... and what you will", "Dawn Williamson", "Hi there to everyone on the listserve!\r\n\r\nA little bit about me \u2013 I live in New York City, work for an internet startup (Hi, Chartbeat!), and have a Great Dane named Lucy (Lucyfur when she\u2019s bad).\r\n\r\nWhat you won\u2019t get in this email: 1) Wide ranging life advice. Hell, I can\u2019t even figure my out my own life. 2) The first chapter of my unpublished novel.  I can barely finish this email. 3) A list of platitudes. Instead, let\u2019s just go with the flow.  ;-)\r\n\r\nWhat you will get: 1) Random life advice. I can do random! 2) Photos of every situation I mention below. If you go to bit (dot) ly (slash) dawnlistserve or go to flickr and search for the user \u201cdawnlistserve\u201d you can see a picture of everything I talk about below.  3) I\u2019m not sure there is a #3, to be honest. Good karma? Great Dane kisses?\r\n\r\nAnyway, here goes:\r\n\r\nI weigh 105 pounds. My dog weighs 120. Here are some questions you shouldn\u2019t ask a big dog owner:    - Does he come with a saddle?    - Are you walking him or is he walking you?    - How do you like owning a horse? Best question I\u2019ve ever received (from a child):    - Is that your pet cow? Best question I\u2019ve ever received (from an adult):    - Is that a puma?\r\n\r\nTelling your NBA-crazy high school girlfriends that you were chosen from amongst a huge group of people to work courtside for an entire Phoenix Suns season was pretty cool. Explaining to your adult colleagues that you were a really great \u2018ball girl\u2019 in high school? Uh, not so much.\r\n\r\nIf you ever visit the FBI building in Washington D.C. and you see an \u201cExit\u201d sign that doesn\u2019t look quite right and no one else is using it, don\u2019t go through the door. Unless you want to get stuck in a 2- x 3-foot construction barrier for 20 minutes.   But\u2026 if this does happen to you, the fastest way to get armed security guards to help you find the real exit is to try to scale the exterior wall, get stuck on the top of it, and rip your pants on the way down.  Seriously, those guys can move pretty fast when they want to.\r\n\r\nIf you ever find yourself in India for a wedding (Hi, Mona!) and you\u2019ve managed to make it the first 11 days of the trip without getting even the tiniest bit sick, don\u2019t get cocky on day 12 and encourage your traveling companion (Hi, Ted!) to drink a glass of freshly squeezed pineapple juice from the hotel breakfast buffet right before the wedding.\r\n\r\nFinally, sometimes you just have to share a photo of your little sister (Hi, Nicole!) with the world so everyone can appreciate it. And I swear the selection has nothing to do with all the years of you teasing, biting, and constantly wanting to hang out with me and my friends.\r\n\r\nThanks for indulging me, everyone! If you write me at dawnlistserve@gmail.com or tweet at me @justsoyouknow, I\u2019ll respond. Pinky swear! xoxo\r\n\r\n\r\nDawn Williamson\t\r\ndawnlistserve@gmail.com \t\r\nNew York City\r\n\r\n", [2013, 1, 5]]

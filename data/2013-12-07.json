["[The Listserve] 22-Year-Old Brain Cells", "Ariel Lani Llorente", "Wow\u2026I won\u2026I never win. I just found out that I won the Listserve\u20265 days ago. -___- Shame on me. Thank you, Connie Chweh, for introducing me to the Listserve\u2026yes, you should be jealous! I\u2019m so proud of you. I\u2019m so happy that you\u2019re in my life. I love you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter 22 years of existence, this is what my brain cells have to offer:\r\n1) Bullying happens because we let it happen. If you\u2019re a witness to it, put a stop to it. We're basically bullies ourselves if we do nothing about it.\r\n2) Let\u2019s finally shut up about our obsession with appearance and be satisfied already.\r\n3) \u201cIn three words, I can sum up everything I\u2019ve learned about life: It goes on.\u201d -Robert Frost\r\n4) I\u2019m below average to poor in math, but according to my calculations, 99% of the time, life always works out. It may not work out how you initially wanted it to, and it may take A LOT of time and \u201cbipolarity\u201d (no disrespect), but it\u2019ll happen if you let it happen and it\u2019ll happen if you make it happen.\r\n5) Weird > Normal. Always. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise. Ever.\r\n6) Besides a broken heart, there\u2019s nothing more heart-breaking than loneliness. Since graduating college in June and starting a \u201cbig girl\u201d job, I have experienced genuine loneliness for the first time. I know that I have people to go to when I\u2019m feeling this way, but sometimes, I just don\u2019t (Sorry, Connie\u2026). Besides that one time I missed the e-mail about winning the Listserve, I\u2019m pretty good about keeping up with my e-mails. If you\u2019re ever feeling lonely, don\u2019t hesitate to send me an e-mail. I know, STRANGER DANGER, but really, I would love to help. And if helping doesn\u2019t go very far\u2026or anywhere at all\u2026know that I have rather large ears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you mind answering these very 22-year-old questions for me?\u00a0\r\n1) What is *your* definition of love?\r\n2) I constantly wonder why we humans do things that make us so unhappy at times, even though we know we could die at any millisecond. How do you feel about this? How do you feel in general? What makes you happy? (Psychologist wannabe over here\u2026)\r\n3) Favorite quote?\r\n4) Favorite song? (These rather large ears are desperate for new music.)\r\n5) My 23rd birthday is coming up\u2026ish. How should I celebrate? How did you/others you know celebrate this mega milestone\u2026not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you mind doing some very 22-year-old favors for me?\r\n1) Please don\u2019t litter. Maybe even pick up some trash when you see it? I know, EW, but trash that has been sitting there for aeons is more EW than taking a few seconds of your time and throwing it away. 2 words: Hand sanitizer.\r\n2) Please make someone\u2019s\u2014ANYONE\u2019S\u2014day today\u2026or everyday. You won\u2019t only make their day, you\u2019ll make your day too.\r\n3) Please do something a little or a lottle different everyday. Your life will be filled with 365-times the memories.\r\n4) Please just tell me about yourself/provide me with some of that wisdom of yours/vent/anything.\u00a0\r\n5) Please be a good person. The universe needs more of those.\u00a0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re anywhere near Fresno, CA, please send me an e-mail, so we can grab some grub and be friends.\u00a0\r\nThank you, Listservians, you\u2019ve taught me quite a bit these past few months. I\u2019m looking forward to reading your jackpot. Happy Holidays. I wish you all the absolute best.\u00a0\r\nHi, Dad. I love you too.\r\n\r\n\r\nAriel Lani Llorente\r\nmellamoariel@aim.com\r\nFresno, CA\r\n\r\n", [2013, 12, 7]]

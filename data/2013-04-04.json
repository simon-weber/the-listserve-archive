["[The Listserve] Take charge", "Gareth", "So of course I get selected for The Listserve on 1st April... leaving me wondering if it is some April Fools' joke - maybe everyone was \"selected\"....?\r\n\r\nHere is some thoughts from my brain... make of it what you will.\r\n\r\nToo often people rush headlong into things, be it purchasing a house, a new car or choosing a career, without stopping to think. People also tend to get stuck in the day-to-day, same-old grind, again without stopping to think. I'm not saying buying a new house is bad, but if you don't work out that you can actually afford it before making the purchase, that is bad. i.e. not thinking things through.\r\n\r\nI say, stop, think and inspect your situation. Often you'll see a better solution, or gain some insight into the situation. Too many people go through life in a semi-disconnected state.\r\n\r\nFor example, \"Maybe buying a new car right now isn't the time - maybe I'm better paying off that student loan\". Actually doing this would make a huge difference to your life in the long run... but most people don't think.\r\n\r\nSo, I guess, my message would be to not just go through life reacting to the world around you, but pro-actively identify positive actions you can take, and take them.\r\n\r\nStop letting things happen to you, and make things happen.\r\n\r\nWhat would be interesting if you could e-mail me a time where you made things happen over letting them happen to you - I'd be interested to compile them into a list (anonymous of course) and it them out to everyone who responded... anyone interested? Drop me a line!\r\n\r\nHopefully this e-mail at least caused you to stop and think...\r\n\r\nGareth\r\nCape Town, South Africa\r\ngareth.listserve@gmail.com\r\n\r\n", [2013, 4, 4]]

["[The Listserve] In The Defense of Cheese", "Justin Smith", "I find I have a few things I often admonish people about, and I\u2019ve picked one to share with you all. First, a little about myself: I am an American guy in my lower twenties. I live in the center of the state of Pennsylvania, and, on the weekends, run a small take-out BBQ. This particular job involves lots of prep work and any needed welding and fabrication to keep things in good shape. Now, as stated before, my intention is to lecture the world about something. This isn\u2019t something terribly life changing, but if you eat meat, you should know this. Use a meat thermometer! People regularly ask me questions about cooking, and when they do I usually ask them a few questions myself. One thing I find is that most people rely on some primal instinct to determine whether their meal is ready. The usual outcome is that otherwise delicious cuts of meat get overdone. There is an easier way. For about $10 you can have a tool that will tell you exactly when your food is done, every time. No more relying on some formula or a pop-out button to determine if that turkey is done, folks. Stick a thermometer in there! If the center is up to 170\u00ba, it\u2019s done, otherwise, it\u2019s not. No poking, prodding, test cuts, or other guesswork. A thermometer is certainly the cook\u2019s best friend. (Tip: don\u2019t cut that turkey right away. Cover and let cool for 10-15 minutes)\r\n\r\n\r\nJustin Smith\r\njustin@mennonitegeek.com\r\nPennsylvania\r\n\r\n", [2012, 7, 21]]

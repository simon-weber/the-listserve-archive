["[The Listserve] My friend Ella", "Steve Ngapo", "I'll keep this short because that's the kind of emails I like :)\r\n\r\nMy friend Ella is a 7 year old girl suffering from NF1, a condition that causes a lot of tumors to grow\r\n\r\nShe has a Facebook page called \"Hope for Ella\" where you can read about her, and see the amazing and selfless things that she does (organising a Christmas party for kids affected by Hurricane Sandy, making sandwiches for her homeless friends in Philidelphia)\r\n\r\nIf you have a minute, it'd really make her day if you liked her Facebook page \"Hope for Ella\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have more than a minute, you should send her your favourite joke - I'm sure she'd love it\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks and have a great day!\r\n\r\n\r\nSteve Ngapo\r\nsteve@stevengapo.com\r\nAuckland, New Zealand\r\n\r\n\r\n", [2013, 12, 11]]

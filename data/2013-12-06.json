["[The Listserve] Good Grief, good friend!", "Taylor Hesselgrave", "Grief. I knew I would write about this the day I signed up.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that 100% of people die, our culture ignores death or grief. When my father died suddenly at 59, I had no fucking clue how to be in this new world *without* him and *with* grief. At first there were lots of people, cards, flowers. Then everyone went back to their lives\u2026 and utter loneliness set in. I felt deserted, but now I understand that I wasn\u2019t the only one who didn\u2019t know what to do.\r\n\r\nSo here\u2019s some \u201cWhat to Do\u2019s\u201d post-funeral to about a year later, the darkest time, next you find your friend in grief:\r\n\r\n----- Listen -----\r\nYou can\u2019t fill my void with words. Don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s in a better place, god has a plan, or any other clich\u00e9 that sounds appropriate but really minimalizes my current, very real experience. He died. And no, this is not like the time your great-aunt died when you were three. Even the true stuff like \u2018time heals\u2019 doesn\u2019t feel good to hear yet. You can simply say, \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say\u201d and just be there. We can sit in silence. Or I probably have lots to say as I work through this: all kinds of sad, weird, dark, crazy, angry, contradictory, random stuff. Just be there, listen to me.\r\n\r\n----- Reach out -----\r\nDon\u2019t wait for me to reach out to you. Call me, when I\u2019m lying in the depths of devastation and meaninglessness, it\u2019s easier to answer the phone than to find one, figure out who to dial, actually do it, and hope they will answer. Randomly stop by, and bring a funny movie (and food!). Be prepared to walk away without hurt feelings if I just want to be alone (leave the food). Likely I\u2019ll need the company and the relief. Just the fact you checked in on me makes me a tiny bit less alone.\r\n\r\nBut you have to reach out a lot, and let me say no. Don\u2019t expect me to be ready to share my pain with you when you\u2019re ready to be available to me. I might finally be feeling good for a few precious moments, don\u2019t force me into a conversation about \u201chow I\u2019m doing with all \u2018that\u2019\u201d just because you have an extra ten today and want to feel like a good friend.\r\n\r\n----- Give -----\r\nDo the little things for me. I need practical help. Whether I am accepting it or not, my life goes on and I need to eat, fulfill some responsibilities, and take care of myself. The grocery store is unbelievably overwhelming. Why are there seven different kinds of EVERYTHING and which to choose? I can\u2019t. It\u2019s meaningless. Everything is meaningless. Why eat? Deliver me lunches, go grocery shopping for me, come fix me dinner, help me clean my space, take me on walks. I won\u2019t think ask you for these things, but I need them.\r\n\r\n--------------------\r\nIt takes time. There\u2019s no correct process or timescale. For me, years have passed and I\u2019m happy and joyful again. I\u2019m forever grateful to the few really good friends who didn\u2019t disappear once the funeral ended. For the rest of my life I\u2019ll miss my dad; what I like best now is reminiscing with family and old friends about him. The stories help him not feel so permanently far away. But he is, he died, and there\u2019s no use ignoring death or minimalizing grief. Talk about it, be there, listen, reach out, give - don\u2019t disappear. Love.\r\n\r\n\r\nTaylor Hesselgrave\r\nPortland, OR\r\nthistlegrave@gmail.com\r\n@taygrave\r\n\r\n", [2013, 12, 6]]

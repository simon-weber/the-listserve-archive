["[The Listserve] Memorial Day", "Tony Bundschuh", "The timing for winning the lottery is pretty good.  As a veteran from a family with a long military history, Memorial Day means a lot to me.  But not really for the reason that most people think.  There is a difference between Memorial Day and Veteran's Day.  Veteran's Day is the one where we give thanks to all that have served, but Memorial Day is supposed to be a somber day set aside for remembrance of those that have died serving their country.  It is just a day for a barbecue or a killer sale at Best Buy or the like.  It is not a happy day.  If you want to see what Memorial Day is really about, search for the video of the Marine that stood at attention and saluted for something like 6 hours during the Rolling Thunder parade in D.C.  He was there to salute his fellow Marines that could not be there because they made the ultimate sacrifice.\r\n\r\nI don't think I can sum it up any better than my friend did today on Facebook.  She is a master sergeant in the Air Force.  She wrote:\r\n\r\n\"Please learn and teach your children the difference between Memorial Day and Veteran's Day. If you want to thank a Veteran - thank them on Veteran's Day or any other day of the year if you're so inclined.\"\r\n\r\n\"Memorial Day is set aside for remembering those that died while serving their country. It is not a happy day. It is a day of rememberance of comrades, friends, and family members who have fallen in service to their country. Never wish anyone a Happy Memorial Day. If you can't think of something more appropriate to say, simply say nothing. We understand and respect your silence much more than your cheery well wishes.\"\r\n\r\nThank you, Mic.  Well said.\r\n\r\n\r\nTony Bundschuh\r\ntony.bundschuh.67+listserve@gmail.com\r\nParker, CO\r\n\r\n", [2013, 5, 28]]

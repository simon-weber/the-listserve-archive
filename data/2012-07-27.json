["[The Listserve]", "PJ", "Here's a true story :\r\n\r\nI was born in 1969, in 1977 2000ad - a British boys comic began. Not expected to last the year, the publishers using the hatch/match/despatch model (HATCH: create a new comic title and an excited audience looking for issue #1. MATCH: Merge a successful title with a less successful title, joining the audience together - usually heralded with the phrase \"EXCITING NEWS CHUMS!\" and, finally, DESPATCH: Shut down publication of the lesser title, saving money)\r\n\r\nIssue 2 of 2000AD featured the introduction of the character \"Judge Dredd\". Designed as an anti hero, Dredd, unintionally, turned out to have a vast appeal to the kids who read it.\r\n\r\nI was one of them.\r\n\r\nWhen I was 14 years old I loved comics and computers but, comics were derided and computers looked like it could lead to a day job (in fact, I started working in computers at 14).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2000, when I turned 30 and 2000AD, unbelievably still in print, was finally catching up with itself, having realised that all I ever wanted to do with my life was to draw comics, I pushed.\r\n\r\nOne year later I was drawing Judge Dredd.\r\n\r\nI've now been drawing comics, and Judge Dredd as a professional comic artist for over a decade. Dreams can come true. Though, sometimes, you have to play the long game.\r\n\r\n\r\npj@pauljholden.com\r\nBelfast, Northern Ireland\r\n\r\n\r\n", [2012, 7, 27]]
